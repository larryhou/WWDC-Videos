11
00:01:56.936 --> 00:01:57.836
>> Hi, everybody.

12
00:01:58.006 --> 00:02:00.426
I'm Debbie Sterling,
and I'm on a mission

13
00:02:01.066 --> 00:02:03.526
to get more girls
into engineering.

14
00:02:04.436 --> 00:02:04.556
Yeah!

15
00:02:05.516 --> 00:02:10.026
[ Applause ]

16
00:02:10.526 --> 00:02:12.116
>> So it probably
sounds kind of corny,

17
00:02:12.116 --> 00:02:15.786
but this mission is really
what gets me up every morning.

18
00:02:16.176 --> 00:02:17.256
It's what makes me tick.

19
00:02:17.976 --> 00:02:20.386
This mission has led
me to accomplish things

20
00:02:20.386 --> 00:02:23.906
that I never thought were
possible before, like standing

21
00:02:23.906 --> 00:02:26.106
up here right now onstage

22
00:02:26.106 --> 00:02:29.166
at the most important developers
conference in the world.

23
00:02:29.786 --> 00:02:32.436
Can you believe it?

24
00:02:33.516 --> 00:02:35.546
[ Applause ]

25
00:02:36.046 --> 00:02:40.486
And this moment, this is just
one of many crazy, outrageous,

26
00:02:40.596 --> 00:02:43.156
audacious goals that
I've set for myself,

27
00:02:43.476 --> 00:02:44.776
all in the name of this mission.

28
00:02:45.596 --> 00:02:48.966
So I'm going to share
my story with you today,

29
00:02:48.966 --> 00:02:52.306
and this is really a
story of audacious goals.

30
00:02:52.856 --> 00:02:55.546
When you dare to be
audacious, amazing,

31
00:02:55.626 --> 00:02:59.376
unbelievable things happen,
like a Super Bowl victory,

32
00:02:59.656 --> 00:03:01.676
a legal battle with
the Beastie Boys,

33
00:03:02.276 --> 00:03:05.546
and a trip to the tattoo
parlor, just to name a few.

34
00:03:06.336 --> 00:03:09.826
This GoldieBlox has
been a really wild ride,

35
00:03:10.296 --> 00:03:11.516
and I've had a lot

36
00:03:11.516 --> 00:03:13.206
of hard-earned lessons
along the way.

37
00:03:13.646 --> 00:03:15.906
But I hope that this story
today that I'm sharing

38
00:03:15.906 --> 00:03:19.086
with you will inspire all
of you to be audacious

39
00:03:19.246 --> 00:03:20.726
for the things that
you believe in.

40
00:03:21.056 --> 00:03:25.036
So I'm going to start my
story right at the beginning.

41
00:03:25.666 --> 00:03:27.256
This is me when I
was a little girl.

42
00:03:28.126 --> 00:03:30.886
Come on, you can
say it -- awwwwwww.

43
00:03:31.376 --> 00:03:35.846
So I grew up in a small
town, went to public school,

44
00:03:36.576 --> 00:03:39.406
small-town U.S.A., Lincoln,
Rhode Island, to be exact.

45
00:03:39.766 --> 00:03:41.136
Any Rhode Islanders in here?

46
00:03:41.426 --> 00:03:42.986
Oh, there's like one, yes.

47
00:03:43.876 --> 00:03:48.086
So growing up in
Lincoln, Rhode Island,

48
00:03:48.406 --> 00:03:52.416
I remember when I had
my first big break,

49
00:03:53.026 --> 00:03:56.576
and this was I got accepted
into Stanford University.

50
00:03:57.316 --> 00:03:59.776
And this was a really
huge deal for me.

51
00:04:00.076 --> 00:04:02.506
No one from my high school
had ever gotten into Stanford.

52
00:04:02.886 --> 00:04:05.756
They announced it on the
loudspeaker, and everyone

53
00:04:05.756 --> 00:04:06.856
in the cafeteria clapped.

54
00:04:07.656 --> 00:04:11.406
It was a huge deal, and
that day my math teacher,

55
00:04:11.406 --> 00:04:15.236
she was my favorite teacher,
pulled me aside and she said,

56
00:04:15.236 --> 00:04:18.116
Debbie, what do you plan
on majoring in at Stanford?

57
00:04:18.685 --> 00:04:19.616
And I said I didn't know.

58
00:04:20.476 --> 00:04:22.036
She said, how about engineering?

59
00:04:22.466 --> 00:04:23.996
I think you would
love engineering.

60
00:04:24.796 --> 00:04:27.406
And I swear to God at that
moment I looked at her

61
00:04:27.946 --> 00:04:29.976
and I pictured an
old man train driver.

62
00:04:30.441 --> 00:04:32.441
[Laughter]

63
00:04:32.866 --> 00:04:35.906
And I really, you know, it's
so funny and it's embarrassing

64
00:04:35.906 --> 00:04:38.506
to admit it, but I really had
no idea what engineering was

65
00:04:39.216 --> 00:04:41.576
and I was too ashamed
of asking her.

66
00:04:41.856 --> 00:04:45.556
So I just kind of shrugged my
shoulders and smiled and said,

67
00:04:45.556 --> 00:04:47.936
sure, Mrs. Verlay,
engineering sounds cool.

68
00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:51.386
So I went off to
Stanford, my freshman year,

69
00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:54.906
and like most typical college
freshman I had no idea what I

70
00:04:54.906 --> 00:04:55.736
wanted to major in.

71
00:04:55.736 --> 00:04:58.026
And her voice stuck in my head,

72
00:04:58.166 --> 00:04:59.936
that you would excel
in engineering.

73
00:05:00.496 --> 00:05:03.626
So I signed up for
Mechanical Engineering 101,

74
00:05:04.126 --> 00:05:07.396
and to my surprise I really
fell in love with that class.

75
00:05:08.086 --> 00:05:11.376
And so for the first time
in my life I set myself

76
00:05:11.446 --> 00:05:15.826
out with an audacious
goal: be an engineer.

77
00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:19.736
Now most of you in this
room are probably engineers

78
00:05:19.786 --> 00:05:22.646
so this probably doesn't sound
audacious to you whatsoever,

79
00:05:23.136 --> 00:05:26.796
but for me this was
an unexpected path.

80
00:05:28.376 --> 00:05:32.246
Once I got to Stanford, it was
really only a handful of women

81
00:05:32.246 --> 00:05:36.116
in my classes, and only
14 percent of women

82
00:05:36.116 --> 00:05:39.526
in the U.S. are engineers,
so it's a huge problem.

83
00:05:40.016 --> 00:05:40.646
And I felt that.

84
00:05:41.486 --> 00:05:45.246
Being one of the only girls
in my classes, it would tend

85
00:05:45.246 --> 00:05:47.236
to mean that the
professors, when they split us

86
00:05:47.236 --> 00:05:50.596
up into group projects, I'd
be the only girl in the group.

87
00:05:51.276 --> 00:05:53.476
And I could see the
look on the guys' faces

88
00:05:53.476 --> 00:05:55.046
when they got stuck
with the girl.

89
00:05:55.906 --> 00:05:58.866
And in our group
projects, I always felt

90
00:05:58.866 --> 00:06:00.426
like my ideas were ignored.

91
00:06:01.096 --> 00:06:04.866
I felt like I'd compare myself
to the guys in my classes

92
00:06:04.896 --> 00:06:07.096
and they just seemed so
much smarter than me,

93
00:06:07.476 --> 00:06:09.876
like they'd been
programming calculators

94
00:06:09.876 --> 00:06:11.116
since they were three.

95
00:06:11.576 --> 00:06:14.556
Many of you in here
probably did do that.

96
00:06:16.076 --> 00:06:19.046
And I really, I never felt
good enough or that I belonged.

97
00:06:19.516 --> 00:06:23.516
I remember the one day that
I almost gave it up entirely.

98
00:06:24.146 --> 00:06:28.016
I had signed up to take an
engineering drawing class.

99
00:06:28.016 --> 00:06:29.986
It was a class where you
had to try and draw things

100
00:06:29.986 --> 00:06:31.806
in 3D, in perspective.

101
00:06:32.326 --> 00:06:34.096
And this class I
was actually excited

102
00:06:34.096 --> 00:06:36.906
about because I'd always
loved art and I figured,

103
00:06:36.906 --> 00:06:40.336
I'm totally going to ace this,
but when I started getting

104
00:06:40.336 --> 00:06:43.086
into the coursework I
struggled with the material.

105
00:06:43.556 --> 00:06:47.266
For some reason, for the life
of me I couldn't draw in 3D.

106
00:06:47.886 --> 00:06:50.986
I tried really hard, and
I remember our final day

107
00:06:50.986 --> 00:06:53.366
of class we had to put
all of our drawings

108
00:06:53.366 --> 00:06:54.856
up on the wall for critique.

109
00:06:55.616 --> 00:06:58.886
And the TAs went around and
they got up to my drawing

110
00:06:59.596 --> 00:07:02.096
and they looked out to the
room, the entire class,

111
00:07:02.356 --> 00:07:05.346
almost all guys, and they
said, raise your hand

112
00:07:05.346 --> 00:07:07.146
if you think Debbie
should pass this class.

113
00:07:09.976 --> 00:07:13.526
And everyone just kind of
stood there, so awkward,

114
00:07:13.646 --> 00:07:14.876
not knowing what to do.

115
00:07:15.456 --> 00:07:18.956
And the teachers asked
again, and I turned beet red.

116
00:07:19.116 --> 00:07:20.936
Everyone is kind of
shuffling their feet,

117
00:07:20.936 --> 00:07:22.086
not knowing what to say.

118
00:07:22.546 --> 00:07:26.626
And, finally, my friend, Micah
got up and he stood up for me,

119
00:07:27.216 --> 00:07:31.436
and he told those TAs that
they were humiliating me

120
00:07:31.496 --> 00:07:32.626
and it was unnecessary.

121
00:07:33.066 --> 00:07:35.626
That it was their job to teach
me, not to make fun of me.

122
00:07:36.516 --> 00:07:40.386
Well, I ran out of that room
and I burst out into tears,

123
00:07:40.756 --> 00:07:42.036
and I'm not much of a crier.

124
00:07:42.116 --> 00:07:45.696
And at that moment I knew
what they were trying to do.

125
00:07:45.696 --> 00:07:48.416
I knew they were trying to
weed me out of the major.

126
00:07:48.956 --> 00:07:51.176
And the worst part was I
felt like I deserved it.

127
00:07:51.916 --> 00:07:55.626
But luckily Micah came to
my side and he told me not

128
00:07:55.626 --> 00:07:57.596
to give up, he told
me to stick with it.

129
00:07:57.596 --> 00:08:00.026
He actually became
an Apple employee,

130
00:08:01.056 --> 00:08:02.876
so he's a pretty
smart guy, right?

131
00:08:03.516 --> 00:08:05.916
[ Applause ]

132
00:08:06.416 --> 00:08:09.316
And so I followed his advice
and I did work harder,

133
00:08:09.316 --> 00:08:10.986
harder than I'd ever
worked in my life,

134
00:08:11.676 --> 00:08:14.086
and I earned my engineering
degree.

135
00:08:15.096 --> 00:08:16.836
And on the day that
I graduated ...

136
00:08:17.336 --> 00:08:21.556
[ Applause ]

137
00:08:22.056 --> 00:08:23.996
... it was really the
proudest day of my life

138
00:08:24.336 --> 00:08:27.046
because I had set an
audacious goal for myself

139
00:08:27.336 --> 00:08:29.046
and I had achieved it.

140
00:08:29.046 --> 00:08:30.966
And what made it so
much more meaningful is

141
00:08:30.966 --> 00:08:34.836
that it wasn't easy for me, and
once I hit it, once I climbed

142
00:08:34.836 --> 00:08:36.486
that mountain and I achieved it,

143
00:08:36.756 --> 00:08:38.395
I learned something
about myself.

144
00:08:38.645 --> 00:08:41.196
I learned that I really
was capable all along.

145
00:08:42.366 --> 00:08:45.256
On the day of my graduation,
it was the same day

146
00:08:45.256 --> 00:08:48.836
that Steve Jobs gave his
infamous 2005 commencement

147
00:08:48.946 --> 00:08:52.016
speech, and that speech
really changed my life.

148
00:08:52.726 --> 00:08:56.836
He told us all to never settle,
to keep pushing, to keep going

149
00:08:56.836 --> 00:08:58.636
until you find your
true passion,

150
00:08:59.166 --> 00:09:00.686
until you can follow your heart.

151
00:09:01.516 --> 00:09:04.746
And I sat there on
that day deciding:

152
00:09:04.816 --> 00:09:06.996
I'm going to find my passion
and I'm going to follow it,

153
00:09:06.996 --> 00:09:09.356
I just don't really
know what it is.

154
00:09:09.996 --> 00:09:12.796
So I started going out
there trying to find it.

155
00:09:12.796 --> 00:09:14.916
I had a bunch of different jobs.

156
00:09:15.216 --> 00:09:16.696
I traveled the world.

157
00:09:16.696 --> 00:09:18.406
I did volunteer work in India.

158
00:09:18.406 --> 00:09:21.546
I was searching and searching,
I've got to follow my heart,

159
00:09:21.546 --> 00:09:24.946
I just, again, don't
know what that is.

160
00:09:25.086 --> 00:09:27.626
Until finally one day it hit me.

161
00:09:28.146 --> 00:09:34.806
I've got to get more
girls into engineering.

162
00:09:35.256 --> 00:09:40.946
The lack of women in engineering
is a joke, literally.

163
00:09:41.496 --> 00:09:43.556
There are memes about it
all over the Internet,

164
00:09:43.556 --> 00:09:48.116
and everyone here knows, and I
know, that there are millions

165
00:09:48.116 --> 00:09:50.386
of girls out there in the
world who are just like me,

166
00:09:50.386 --> 00:09:53.106
who have it in them but
probably won't get lucky enough

167
00:09:53.106 --> 00:09:56.176
to have a math teacher pull them
aside and encourage them, right?

168
00:09:56.916 --> 00:10:01.376
So I started becoming obsessed
with why there are so few girls

169
00:10:01.516 --> 00:10:04.626
and women in engineering and
what I could do to change that.

170
00:10:05.226 --> 00:10:07.896
I started talking about
it with everyone I could,

171
00:10:07.896 --> 00:10:10.356
and asking them, how did
you get into engineering,

172
00:10:10.356 --> 00:10:12.526
and why are there so
few women and girls?

173
00:10:13.006 --> 00:10:17.356
And I started to hear the same
response over and over again:

174
00:10:17.356 --> 00:10:18.386
you can't fight nature.

175
00:10:19.636 --> 00:10:22.926
Seriously, smart, educated
people would tell me, you know,

176
00:10:23.436 --> 00:10:25.346
there are just biological
differences

177
00:10:25.346 --> 00:10:26.456
between men and women.

178
00:10:26.456 --> 00:10:29.056
And they told me, you know,

179
00:10:29.056 --> 00:10:32.906
men just are naturally inclined
toward building and engineering,

180
00:10:32.906 --> 00:10:34.586
they're just good
at it, you know?

181
00:10:35.066 --> 00:10:38.766
They've got spatial skills,
they're born to be engineers.

182
00:10:39.536 --> 00:10:40.946
Well, this really pissed me off.

183
00:10:43.516 --> 00:10:48.226
[ Applause ]

184
00:10:48.726 --> 00:10:50.556
It did, I mean I got
into engineering,

185
00:10:50.556 --> 00:10:52.906
does that make me a freak
of nature or something?

186
00:10:53.756 --> 00:10:57.616
So this pissed me off
so much I decided to set

187
00:10:57.696 --> 00:11:02.136
out with my next audacious
goal: I'm going to fight nature.

188
00:11:02.676 --> 00:11:04.936
You say you can't fight nature,
well, I'm going to fight nature.

189
00:11:05.656 --> 00:11:09.606
And what I started to do was
I wanted to get smart on it.

190
00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:12.326
Is there any validity to
what these people are saying?

191
00:11:12.386 --> 00:11:13.526
I'm going to do my homework.

192
00:11:14.106 --> 00:11:17.626
So I started doing research
and read every study I could

193
00:11:17.666 --> 00:11:18.756
on gender differences.

194
00:11:18.756 --> 00:11:21.516
I wanted to know the
difference between the sexes,

195
00:11:22.686 --> 00:11:26.196
those biological drivers
between men and women.

196
00:11:26.386 --> 00:11:28.066
So I read research articles.

197
00:11:28.066 --> 00:11:29.646
I talked to neuroscientists.

198
00:11:30.076 --> 00:11:32.756
I studied cognitive
development in children.

199
00:11:32.756 --> 00:11:35.376
I met with engineers,
and parents,

200
00:11:35.376 --> 00:11:36.956
and teachers, everybody I could.

201
00:11:37.746 --> 00:11:39.746
And I learned some
really interesting things.

202
00:11:40.626 --> 00:11:43.196
First, I learned that,
yes, there are differences

203
00:11:43.226 --> 00:11:44.366
between men and women.

204
00:11:44.666 --> 00:11:46.616
There are differences
between boys and girls.

205
00:11:47.166 --> 00:11:50.066
For example, I learned if
you give a boy a stick,

206
00:11:50.066 --> 00:11:53.586
he will most likely turn it
into a gun and shoot it at you.

207
00:11:54.636 --> 00:11:55.516
This is true, actually,

208
00:11:55.516 --> 00:11:57.706
my three-year-old
cousin literally did this

209
00:11:57.836 --> 00:11:59.506
to me the other day
with my own toys.

210
00:12:00.826 --> 00:12:04.196
I also learned that girls
are naturally inclined toward

211
00:12:04.196 --> 00:12:06.706
nurturing, in case they
become a mother someday.

212
00:12:06.836 --> 00:12:09.826
This is why baby dolls
and soft cuddly pets are

213
00:12:09.826 --> 00:12:11.146
so popular with girls.

214
00:12:12.236 --> 00:12:14.846
I learned that in
preschool classrooms,

215
00:12:15.166 --> 00:12:17.916
boys like to compete
mano a mano,

216
00:12:17.916 --> 00:12:20.066
man against man,
winner takes all.

217
00:12:20.516 --> 00:12:22.176
Whereas girls like situations

218
00:12:22.176 --> 00:12:24.996
where everybody works
together toward a common goal,

219
00:12:25.026 --> 00:12:26.136
where everybody wins.

220
00:12:26.576 --> 00:12:29.926
And the way that girls tend to
compete is by excluding others.

221
00:12:30.326 --> 00:12:32.156
It's called cliques,
and I have been

222
00:12:32.156 --> 00:12:33.726
in a few cliques in my life.

223
00:12:34.996 --> 00:12:37.116
And I learned so many
things, but I'll jump ahead

224
00:12:37.216 --> 00:12:40.806
to really I think the
most important study.

225
00:12:40.986 --> 00:12:41.976
It was done recently.

226
00:12:41.976 --> 00:12:43.586
There was a global test.

227
00:12:44.026 --> 00:12:45.956
Around the world they
tested boys and girls

228
00:12:45.956 --> 00:12:47.456
on the same exact science test.

229
00:12:48.116 --> 00:12:49.406
And what the results showed was

230
00:12:49.406 --> 00:12:53.066
that girls actually outperformed
the boys on that test

231
00:12:53.066 --> 00:12:54.386
in most parts of the world,

232
00:12:54.696 --> 00:12:59.056
but not in the U.S. What this
study showed, and many others

233
00:12:59.056 --> 00:13:00.466
that have been done
just like it,

234
00:13:00.616 --> 00:13:03.396
is that there's actually no
innate intellectual difference

235
00:13:03.446 --> 00:13:06.456
between boys and girls in
the math and science fields.

236
00:13:07.016 --> 00:13:10.386
What the study suggests is
that the problem isn't nature,

237
00:13:11.246 --> 00:13:13.536
the problem is actually culture.

238
00:13:14.426 --> 00:13:17.726
And from a young age, girls
and boys when they look

239
00:13:17.726 --> 00:13:20.816
at the world they see
engineering as a boys' club.

240
00:13:21.316 --> 00:13:26.366
You've got Handy Manny; Bob the
Builder; Sid the Science Kid;

241
00:13:26.566 --> 00:13:32.786
Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius;
Bill Nye, the Science Guy.

242
00:13:32.786 --> 00:13:35.226
From a young age this
is what kids believe,

243
00:13:35.796 --> 00:13:37.696
these are the builders, right?

244
00:13:38.256 --> 00:13:41.936
And what's even worse is
when you look at the world

245
00:13:42.006 --> 00:13:45.686
through the eyes of a kid
it's very clear that dolls are

246
00:13:45.686 --> 00:13:48.046
for girls and building
is for boys.

247
00:13:49.036 --> 00:13:52.416
Take a walk down the pink
aisle and there's princesses,

248
00:13:52.546 --> 00:14:00.056
Barbie Dolls, fashion, literally
ironing boards today in 2015.

249
00:14:00.356 --> 00:14:04.096
It's like we're back in the
1950s, and all the products

250
00:14:04.096 --> 00:14:07.226
and characters for girls
tell girls that beauty

251
00:14:07.226 --> 00:14:09.226
above all is what's important.

252
00:14:10.186 --> 00:14:11.596
Meanwhile, the blue aisle

253
00:14:11.596 --> 00:14:15.856
for boys has the awesome super
heroes and action figures

254
00:14:15.856 --> 00:14:18.766
and brainteasers and
construction sets.

255
00:14:18.916 --> 00:14:21.886
Those things really help
develop an interest in science

256
00:14:21.886 --> 00:14:23.716
and technology, engineering
and math,

257
00:14:23.716 --> 00:14:25.696
develop spatial skills,
tinkering.

258
00:14:26.336 --> 00:14:30.976
So I was in this very pink
aisle four years ago and I felt

259
00:14:30.976 --> 00:14:32.646
like I was in the Twilight Zone.

260
00:14:33.586 --> 00:14:35.986
And at that instant
I just knew in my gut

261
00:14:36.536 --> 00:14:38.796
that this was my
opportunity to change it.

262
00:14:38.796 --> 00:14:41.556
So I came up with an obsession.

263
00:14:42.456 --> 00:14:45.666
I'm going to invent an
engineering toy for girls.

264
00:14:47.276 --> 00:14:50.096
I left the store that
day, filled up a cart

265
00:14:50.096 --> 00:14:52.826
with as many toys as I could
and I decided, all right,

266
00:14:52.826 --> 00:14:54.096
I'm going to start
doing research,

267
00:14:54.096 --> 00:14:55.086
get to the bottom of this.

268
00:14:55.186 --> 00:14:57.666
How can I get girls into
building and construction?

269
00:14:58.316 --> 00:15:00.786
I went around, begged my
friends, please, please,

270
00:15:00.786 --> 00:15:03.196
please let me babysit your kids.

271
00:15:03.556 --> 00:15:04.856
They were like, all right.

272
00:15:05.526 --> 00:15:08.296
But I needed even more
kids, people I didn't know.

273
00:15:08.296 --> 00:15:12.036
I was searching and searching,
how do I find kids to test on?

274
00:15:12.206 --> 00:15:16.656
I even posted -- I posted
an ad on Craigslist.

275
00:15:17.636 --> 00:15:22.636
I did. It said free childcare
for girls four to nine.

276
00:15:25.276 --> 00:15:28.806
And I didn't realize it
sounded so creepy, right?

277
00:15:30.056 --> 00:15:31.856
My husband was like, thank
God you're not trying

278
00:15:31.856 --> 00:15:34.126
to start a babysitting
company, what's wrong with you?

279
00:15:34.766 --> 00:15:37.916
And only one person
replied, this French woman,

280
00:15:37.916 --> 00:15:40.586
who I think it got lost in
translation or something.

281
00:15:40.586 --> 00:15:42.016
She must have been
like, America,

282
00:15:42.016 --> 00:15:43.576
the greatest place in the world!

283
00:15:44.076 --> 00:15:46.976
But I actually went to her house
and I babysat her daughter.

284
00:15:47.396 --> 00:15:51.376
And through all of this time
I spent with kids I started

285
00:15:51.376 --> 00:15:52.596
to notice some patterns.

286
00:15:53.016 --> 00:15:55.386
I noticed that boys
would build for the sake

287
00:15:55.386 --> 00:15:56.856
of building all day long.

288
00:15:56.986 --> 00:15:59.686
They would build it
up and smash it down

289
00:15:59.906 --> 00:16:00.886
and do it again and again.

290
00:16:01.596 --> 00:16:04.616
I noticed that the girls
really liked stories

291
00:16:04.616 --> 00:16:06.856
and characters, they
liked narrative.

292
00:16:06.926 --> 00:16:09.216
They didn't just want to
build, but they'd want

293
00:16:09.386 --> 00:16:11.326
to build something
for a purpose, like,

294
00:16:11.326 --> 00:16:14.306
why are we building it and who
is it for, and who is it going

295
00:16:14.366 --> 00:16:17.426
to help, and where is it, and
what's the story behind it?

296
00:16:18.316 --> 00:16:23.106
And so all of this research
kind of led me to an "aha" way

297
00:16:23.106 --> 00:16:24.596
to engage girls in building.

298
00:16:25.726 --> 00:16:28.046
It was a really simple
idea, but I thought,

299
00:16:28.046 --> 00:16:30.816
what if I combined
building with a story?

300
00:16:31.686 --> 00:16:35.606
I came up with this
character that I invented,

301
00:16:35.606 --> 00:16:38.826
named GoldieBlox, and she
would be the girl builder,

302
00:16:38.826 --> 00:16:39.826
a girl engineer.

303
00:16:40.266 --> 00:16:42.836
And she'd go on adventures
and have to solve problems

304
00:16:42.836 --> 00:16:44.306
by building contraptions.

305
00:16:44.616 --> 00:16:48.496
And I thought if girls thought
she was cool and they wanted

306
00:16:48.496 --> 00:16:50.426
to be like her and
do what she does,

307
00:16:50.426 --> 00:16:52.916
then maybe that would
get them to build, too,

308
00:16:53.226 --> 00:16:54.696
and maybe the little machines

309
00:16:54.696 --> 00:16:57.596
that they build can teach
them engineering principles

310
00:16:57.596 --> 00:16:59.666
and help solve problems,
give that context

311
00:16:59.996 --> 00:17:01.236
that girls were looking for.

312
00:17:01.776 --> 00:17:05.876
So this was my genius idea,
this engineering toy for girls.

313
00:17:06.715 --> 00:17:09.685
And I became so obsessed
with it,

314
00:17:09.685 --> 00:17:14.496
it led me to my next audacious
goal: build a startup.

315
00:17:15.846 --> 00:17:19.715
So at the time when I came
up with this engineering toy

316
00:17:19.715 --> 00:17:21.715
for girls, I was working

317
00:17:21.715 --> 00:17:25.776
at a pretty cushy nine-to-five
job, steady paycheck.

318
00:17:26.396 --> 00:17:28.286
And, in fact, ever
since I was old enough

319
00:17:28.356 --> 00:17:31.126
to work I always had
a job, so the thought

320
00:17:31.126 --> 00:17:33.726
of actually leaving it and
starting out on my own,

321
00:17:33.726 --> 00:17:35.336
it was pretty terrifying.

322
00:17:36.006 --> 00:17:38.666
But it got to the point
where I was so obsessed

323
00:17:38.836 --> 00:17:40.746
with GoldieBlox it was
all I could think about,

324
00:17:40.746 --> 00:17:43.916
all I could talk about,
it got to the point

325
00:17:43.916 --> 00:17:44.996
where it didn't feel
like a choice,

326
00:17:44.996 --> 00:17:48.046
it felt like it was
just what I had to do.

327
00:17:48.696 --> 00:17:52.736
So I decided to give myself one
year, I'm going to go for it.

328
00:17:52.876 --> 00:17:56.166
I have enough money in my bank
account that if by the end

329
00:17:56.166 --> 00:18:00.136
of one year this doesn't work
out, then I can always just go

330
00:18:00.136 --> 00:18:01.346
and get another job, right?

331
00:18:01.776 --> 00:18:05.866
And even if I fail at the end
of the year, am I ever going

332
00:18:05.866 --> 00:18:08.176
to be ashamed for telling
people that I tried

333
00:18:08.176 --> 00:18:09.836
to get girls into engineering?

334
00:18:11.046 --> 00:18:13.596
No, so I went for it.

335
00:18:14.896 --> 00:18:18.456
This is a picture of
me on the first day

336
00:18:18.456 --> 00:18:21.966
of starting my dream job on
the floor of my apartment,

337
00:18:23.226 --> 00:18:25.006
and I spent hours and hours.

338
00:18:25.006 --> 00:18:27.336
I had this image in my head.

339
00:18:27.336 --> 00:18:30.626
And I needed to be like the
mad scientist, and I needed

340
00:18:30.626 --> 00:18:32.276
to labor away until I came

341
00:18:32.276 --> 00:18:34.956
up with this brilliant
masterpiece invention.

342
00:18:35.916 --> 00:18:40.256
I was so paranoid that
somebody might steal my idea

343
00:18:40.876 --> 00:18:45.366
that I made anyone who came
anywhere near my prototype sign

344
00:18:45.366 --> 00:18:46.206
an NDA.

345
00:18:47.606 --> 00:18:50.646
I even made my mom sign an NDA.

346
00:18:51.736 --> 00:18:53.096
And I worked and worked on this.

347
00:18:53.096 --> 00:18:55.296
I was drawing pictures of
Goldie, what she might look

348
00:18:55.296 --> 00:18:58.476
like building machines,
using thread spools and clay,

349
00:18:58.476 --> 00:19:00.526
stuff around the house,
the hardware store,

350
00:19:00.816 --> 00:19:02.826
until finally I had
a working prototype.

351
00:19:02.936 --> 00:19:06.906
And it was the ugliest
thing you have ever seen,

352
00:19:07.296 --> 00:19:08.836
but it worked and I was excited.

353
00:19:08.836 --> 00:19:12.596
And so I finally decided I'm
going to take this prototype

354
00:19:12.596 --> 00:19:14.406
to the New York Toy
Fair and I'm going

355
00:19:14.406 --> 00:19:17.256
to see what the industry
has to say.

356
00:19:17.306 --> 00:19:22.416
So I went to the show with my
prototype and a badge I managed

357
00:19:22.516 --> 00:19:25.486
to finagle, pretty
much snuck in,

358
00:19:25.486 --> 00:19:27.496
and a giant stack
of NDAs, of course.

359
00:19:28.576 --> 00:19:31.096
And started walking
around booth to booth,

360
00:19:31.296 --> 00:19:33.806
talking with everyone I
could, toy store owners,

361
00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:37.996
toy executives, other
toy inventors to try

362
00:19:37.996 --> 00:19:40.946
to get their feedback on what
they thought of my genius idea,

363
00:19:41.366 --> 00:19:42.796
the engineering toy for girls.

364
00:19:43.586 --> 00:19:47.326
Well, the response
was pretty unanimous,

365
00:19:48.876 --> 00:19:50.066
you can't fight nature.

366
00:19:50.776 --> 00:19:55.596
Again, these people, they
told me that girls like dolls

367
00:19:55.996 --> 00:19:57.056
and boys like building,

368
00:19:57.486 --> 00:20:00.136
that a construction toy
for girls won't sell.

369
00:20:00.646 --> 00:20:03.476
They actually took me
by the arm and walked me

370
00:20:03.476 --> 00:20:05.486
down the pink aisle
of the trade show

371
00:20:05.976 --> 00:20:07.736
where we had the ironing boards

372
00:20:07.736 --> 00:20:09.406
and the fashion dolls
and the tea sets.

373
00:20:10.066 --> 00:20:11.396
They said this is
what girls want,

374
00:20:12.036 --> 00:20:14.876
girls want to be princesses,
they don't want to be engineers.

375
00:20:15.756 --> 00:20:19.256
They said maybe if you're
lucky you can license your idea

376
00:20:19.336 --> 00:20:22.986
to some little educational
toy reseller

377
00:20:22.986 --> 00:20:25.266
who maybe can convince
a school to put it in,

378
00:20:26.186 --> 00:20:28.356
but starting your own company,

379
00:20:28.746 --> 00:20:30.846
trying to make this
go mainstream,

380
00:20:31.216 --> 00:20:34.496
it's an uphill battle and
you're never going to win it.

381
00:20:34.686 --> 00:20:36.986
So I left the show
pretty dejected

382
00:20:36.986 --> 00:20:39.406
because at this point
I'd quit my job,

383
00:20:39.786 --> 00:20:44.016
I was going off my life's
savings, and I was worried,

384
00:20:44.196 --> 00:20:46.166
what if they're right,
am I crazy?

385
00:20:46.986 --> 00:20:49.586
So after the show was
over, I signed up to go

386
00:20:49.586 --> 00:20:51.706
to this social entrepreneur
conference called

387
00:20:51.806 --> 00:20:52.366
Starting Block.

388
00:20:52.846 --> 00:20:54.626
It was a group of
100 young people

389
00:20:54.626 --> 00:20:55.926
who wanted to change the world.

390
00:20:56.646 --> 00:21:00.286
Now I was feeling pretty
dejected after Toy Fair and,

391
00:21:00.336 --> 00:21:02.626
honestly, I wasn't
really in the mood to go

392
00:21:02.626 --> 00:21:05.476
and do more networking, but
I had already signed up,

393
00:21:05.476 --> 00:21:08.016
I already paid, so
I went anyway.

394
00:21:08.166 --> 00:21:09.676
And in that session, one

395
00:21:09.676 --> 00:21:12.636
of the first exercises they
had us do was make all of us go

396
00:21:12.636 --> 00:21:13.996
up in front of the entire room

397
00:21:13.996 --> 00:21:16.416
and tell people what
we were working on,

398
00:21:16.416 --> 00:21:17.586
what we were passionate about.

399
00:21:18.006 --> 00:21:22.166
Well, I was still so paranoid I
asked the conference organizers

400
00:21:22.166 --> 00:21:25.296
if I could have all 100
attendees sign an NDA.

401
00:21:25.296 --> 00:21:31.266
And they're like, no, no,
no, that's not possible,

402
00:21:31.356 --> 00:21:33.546
you just get up there and
do it anyway for God's sake.

403
00:21:33.936 --> 00:21:36.096
So I went up in front
of the room

404
00:21:36.096 --> 00:21:40.346
and for the first time ever,
I told the story and the idea

405
00:21:40.346 --> 00:21:44.396
of GoldieBlox publicly,
and the room exploded.

406
00:21:45.056 --> 00:21:48.016
People got to their feet
in standing ovation.

407
00:21:48.806 --> 00:21:50.496
They formed a line around me

408
00:21:50.656 --> 00:21:52.246
and everybody wanted
to be a part of it.

409
00:21:52.246 --> 00:21:53.676
They wanted to know
how they could help.

410
00:21:53.676 --> 00:21:57.716
At that conference I
learned a bunch of things

411
00:21:57.716 --> 00:22:02.106
about entrepreneurship, but
two lessons really stand out.

412
00:22:02.216 --> 00:22:06.156
The first one that I learned was
this idea called creating your

413
00:22:06.156 --> 00:22:06.526
own luck.

414
00:22:07.716 --> 00:22:11.416
One of the conference organizers
got up and told his story

415
00:22:11.626 --> 00:22:14.106
about how he went
after his dream job.

416
00:22:14.726 --> 00:22:16.886
He knew what organization
he wanted to work at,

417
00:22:16.936 --> 00:22:18.596
but he didn't have
any connections there.

418
00:22:19.306 --> 00:22:23.526
So he started cold emailing,
coming up with every first

419
00:22:23.526 --> 00:22:26.776
and last name combination
he possibly could of someone

420
00:22:26.776 --> 00:22:28.876
at the company, like B.

421
00:22:28.986 --> 00:22:31.796
Smith at company
dot com, Brandon S.

422
00:22:32.056 --> 00:22:35.566
at company dot com, emailing
every combination he could,

423
00:22:36.506 --> 00:22:37.256
got no response.

424
00:22:37.706 --> 00:22:40.166
So he did it again a week later,

425
00:22:40.336 --> 00:22:43.496
every combo he could possibly
think of, no response.

426
00:22:44.306 --> 00:22:46.426
Did it again a week later.

427
00:22:47.226 --> 00:22:50.206
Finally, a woman wrote
him back begging him

428
00:22:50.206 --> 00:22:53.856
to stopmailing everyone, and
she said, fine, I will meet you

429
00:22:53.856 --> 00:22:55.936
at a coffee shop for
an informal interview.

430
00:22:56.776 --> 00:22:57.586
He got the job.

431
00:22:58.116 --> 00:23:01.086
He didn't just sit around
waiting for luck to come to him.

432
00:23:01.086 --> 00:23:04.746
He went out and got it, even
as shamelessly as he did so.

433
00:23:05.126 --> 00:23:08.856
The next lesson I learned
was about the difference

434
00:23:08.856 --> 00:23:11.526
between being an inventor
and an entrepreneur.

435
00:23:12.466 --> 00:23:15.486
I learned that an inventor
is somebody who holes up,

436
00:23:15.866 --> 00:23:18.476
working on their ideas
all alone in isolation,

437
00:23:18.476 --> 00:23:20.566
trying to perfect
something all by themselves,

438
00:23:21.366 --> 00:23:24.666
but an entrepreneur is somebody
who really puts themselves

439
00:23:24.666 --> 00:23:27.556
out there, tells as
many people as they can

440
00:23:27.556 --> 00:23:29.766
about what they're passionate
about, what they're working on,

441
00:23:30.016 --> 00:23:33.036
and builds a community around
them to be a part of it.

442
00:23:33.036 --> 00:23:35.496
And I realized that all
along I'd been acting

443
00:23:35.496 --> 00:23:38.196
like an inventor, I
was a total hermit,

444
00:23:38.196 --> 00:23:40.156
and that was lonely, too.

445
00:23:40.786 --> 00:23:44.776
And now I had this whole group
of people who believed in me

446
00:23:44.876 --> 00:23:47.526
and believed in GoldieBlox,
who wanted to be a part of it,

447
00:23:47.526 --> 00:23:51.486
and not only that could
actually help make it better.

448
00:23:51.486 --> 00:23:54.796
So from that day forward
my whole view shifted.

449
00:23:54.796 --> 00:23:59.706
After I left the conference,
the people there started showing

450
00:23:59.706 --> 00:24:01.466
up in my apartment every day,

451
00:24:01.746 --> 00:24:03.326
and they started
bringing their friends,

452
00:24:03.746 --> 00:24:05.566
and their friends
brought their friends.

453
00:24:06.116 --> 00:24:08.806
And this group of passionate
people gave me the energy

454
00:24:08.806 --> 00:24:10.376
that I needed to
get excited again,

455
00:24:10.506 --> 00:24:12.976
and we started building
prototypes

456
00:24:12.976 --> 00:24:14.396
and encouraging each other.

457
00:24:15.416 --> 00:24:18.086
We even started a blog
where we'd write stories

458
00:24:18.086 --> 00:24:19.426
about what we were
learning and the challenges

459
00:24:19.576 --> 00:24:22.146
that we were facing, and we'd
share it with all our friends

460
00:24:22.146 --> 00:24:24.146
and family and find
more people to help.

461
00:24:25.496 --> 00:24:28.226
And with the help of
this crew of people,

462
00:24:28.756 --> 00:24:31.476
we built GoldieBlox
prototypes and took them all

463
00:24:31.476 --> 00:24:34.206
around the Bay area, into
people's homes and schools,

464
00:24:34.206 --> 00:24:37.336
to Maker Faire to
test it on kids.

465
00:24:37.926 --> 00:24:40.926
It was a process of rapid
prototyping, and the great thing

466
00:24:40.926 --> 00:24:44.276
about it is since we had no
money we didn't get too married

467
00:24:44.276 --> 00:24:46.826
to any one idea, we just
put it out in front of kids

468
00:24:46.826 --> 00:24:47.806
and see what they thought.

469
00:24:48.266 --> 00:24:50.446
We just really wanted to
know what was going to work

470
00:24:50.446 --> 00:24:52.096
with the girls, what
they wanted.

471
00:24:52.626 --> 00:24:54.306
And, finally, after
months and months

472
00:24:54.306 --> 00:24:57.156
of testing we had a product
that I really believed in.

473
00:24:58.386 --> 00:25:01.416
This was our first toy,
it's called GoldieBlox

474
00:25:01.416 --> 00:25:02.646
and the Spinning Machine.

475
00:25:03.206 --> 00:25:07.586
In it we have our story, a book
about Goldie and her dog, Nacho,

476
00:25:07.936 --> 00:25:09.346
who is always chasing his tail.

477
00:25:09.996 --> 00:25:12.336
So Goldie decides, I'm
going to spin Nacho.

478
00:25:12.806 --> 00:25:16.036
By using a wheel and an axle,
she builds a spinning machine.

479
00:25:16.956 --> 00:25:20.326
But soon her other animal
friends want to spin, too.

480
00:25:20.736 --> 00:25:22.486
So Goldie invents a belt drive

481
00:25:22.826 --> 00:25:24.956
where she gets everybody
spinning all at once.

482
00:25:26.296 --> 00:25:28.836
This product, you know,
as simple as it sounds,

483
00:25:29.116 --> 00:25:30.636
really did engage
the little girls.

484
00:25:30.796 --> 00:25:35.066
I had girls in tutus pounding
their fists on the table,

485
00:25:35.066 --> 00:25:37.716
we have to have everybody spin!

486
00:25:38.356 --> 00:25:40.236
So it works.

487
00:25:40.576 --> 00:25:44.256
And it was back to all of
the research that I had done,

488
00:25:44.466 --> 00:25:46.346
creating the scenarios
where everybody wins,

489
00:25:46.416 --> 00:25:48.416
engaging with story,
having nurturing,

490
00:25:48.416 --> 00:25:49.816
having pets and characters.

491
00:25:50.256 --> 00:25:54.856
I knew it worked, but the
problem was I knew not a single

492
00:25:54.856 --> 00:25:57.566
toy store was going to buy
it because they didn't think

493
00:25:57.566 --> 00:25:58.666
that girls like building.

494
00:25:59.296 --> 00:26:02.936
Also, I only had $2,000
left in my bank account

495
00:26:02.996 --> 00:26:06.176
so that was not good
either, and in order

496
00:26:06.176 --> 00:26:10.256
to actually produce
GoldieBlox I needed $150,000

497
00:26:10.566 --> 00:26:12.186
for a first manufacturing run.

498
00:26:13.406 --> 00:26:16.316
So I had to set out with
my next audacious goal,

499
00:26:18.156 --> 00:26:19.686
Kickstart a movement.

500
00:26:20.796 --> 00:26:24.226
I decided if the toy store
owners weren't going to buy it,

501
00:26:24.226 --> 00:26:27.176
I was going to need to
crowdfund it and prove

502
00:26:27.176 --> 00:26:28.116
that there was market demand.

503
00:26:29.446 --> 00:26:31.986
So as everyone knows
with Kickstarter,

504
00:26:32.126 --> 00:26:36.706
in order to crush it you need
an amazing video, and so I got

505
00:26:36.776 --> 00:26:40.236
to work plotting out
the perfect video plan.

506
00:26:41.246 --> 00:26:42.726
First, I convinced a friend

507
00:26:42.726 --> 00:26:45.316
to let me use his
beautiful workshop, you know,

508
00:26:45.316 --> 00:26:46.636
make it seem really cool.

509
00:26:47.186 --> 00:26:49.126
Then I convinced my husband,

510
00:26:49.126 --> 00:26:50.966
who owned a video
production company,

511
00:26:51.556 --> 00:26:54.436
to use all of their best --

512
00:26:54.646 --> 00:27:00.946
I know it's like kind of a
helpful think I know, I know,

513
00:27:00.946 --> 00:27:02.736
I know -- but convince
him to film this video

514
00:27:02.736 --> 00:27:06.106
with the best equipment,
lighting, camera people.

515
00:27:06.686 --> 00:27:08.996
And I memorized this
perfect script,

516
00:27:09.406 --> 00:27:10.896
the whole thing memorized.

517
00:27:11.536 --> 00:27:14.996
Got my hair done, my makeup,
went out and bought a new dress.

518
00:27:15.746 --> 00:27:18.666
I was all set, ready to
go, and brought in all

519
00:27:18.666 --> 00:27:20.216
of these people to come help.

520
00:27:20.386 --> 00:27:24.666
We filmed the video and
we were right on time,

521
00:27:24.666 --> 00:27:26.516
we were about to
launch the campaign

522
00:27:26.646 --> 00:27:28.116
in a week, everything was set.

523
00:27:28.636 --> 00:27:31.886
And then the film crew sent
me the first cut of the video

524
00:27:32.736 --> 00:27:40.256
and my heart sank, it was
too good, it felt staged,

525
00:27:40.576 --> 00:27:42.806
it just didn't feel like
me, it wasn't genuine.

526
00:27:43.426 --> 00:27:46.626
You see, when I tell people
face to face about my passion

527
00:27:46.626 --> 00:27:49.656
for GoldieBlox, they get it and
they believe it and they want

528
00:27:49.656 --> 00:27:51.576
to be a part of it,
but this video was

529
00:27:51.576 --> 00:27:55.066
so overdone it just wasn't
reading, it didn't feel natural.

530
00:27:55.716 --> 00:27:59.146
And so even though we only had
a couple days left before the

531
00:27:59.146 --> 00:28:01.646
Kickstarter was going to
go live, and even though

532
00:28:01.646 --> 00:28:04.096
so many people had
helped me make this video

533
00:28:04.096 --> 00:28:05.986
and I felt really bad, I had

534
00:28:05.986 --> 00:28:09.416
to scrap the whole thing,
I had to reshoot it.

535
00:28:10.216 --> 00:28:13.106
Literally, we had two days left,
on the floor of my apartment.

536
00:28:14.166 --> 00:28:17.536
And in order to get
comfortable enough to be myself

537
00:28:17.676 --> 00:28:20.456
when a video camera was
staring at me six inches away

538
00:28:20.506 --> 00:28:23.216
from my face I had to
drink three-quarters

539
00:28:23.216 --> 00:28:23.976
of a bottle of wine.

540
00:28:24.516 --> 00:28:29.896
[ Applause ]

541
00:28:30.396 --> 00:28:33.306
Actually, I just did that
backstage -- no, just kidding.

542
00:28:34.046 --> 00:28:38.956
But finally after hundreds of
takes, no script, I just spoke

543
00:28:38.956 --> 00:28:41.296
from the heart, and that
was actually the footage

544
00:28:41.296 --> 00:28:44.556
that we used once we cut out
all of the slurring parts.

545
00:28:48.126 --> 00:28:50.586
Next order of business,
we had the video

546
00:28:50.646 --> 00:28:52.556
and now we needed the support.

547
00:28:53.166 --> 00:28:55.346
In true create your
own luck form,

548
00:28:55.786 --> 00:28:59.486
we created this serial
killer-style list of all

549
00:28:59.486 --> 00:29:02.336
of the people that we knew
we had to let them know

550
00:29:02.336 --> 00:29:04.986
about GoldieBlox in hopes
that they would share it --

551
00:29:05.276 --> 00:29:08.286
celebrities, journalists,
people with big audiences,

552
00:29:08.286 --> 00:29:12.296
everyone we could who we thought
could help get the word out.

553
00:29:12.996 --> 00:29:15.666
And then we started mapping
them, who are these people,

554
00:29:15.666 --> 00:29:16.596
how can we get to them?

555
00:29:16.596 --> 00:29:18.236
Does someone know
someone who knows someone

556
00:29:18.236 --> 00:29:21.086
who can get to Hillary Clinton?

557
00:29:21.386 --> 00:29:24.536
And we maniacally
schemed and plotted.

558
00:29:25.066 --> 00:29:27.996
One of the people on this
list was Tim Schafer,

559
00:29:28.796 --> 00:29:30.956
and I'll just tell the story
of how I got a hold of him.

560
00:29:31.406 --> 00:29:33.926
He was one of many
examples of the people

561
00:29:33.926 --> 00:29:35.336
who we relentlessly stalked.

562
00:29:36.156 --> 00:29:38.986
So after stalking Tim I found --

563
00:29:39.216 --> 00:29:40.846
and Tim, for those of
you who don't know,

564
00:29:40.846 --> 00:29:43.936
legendary videogame designer
and Kickstarter celebrity.

565
00:29:44.556 --> 00:29:49.986
After stalking him, I found
out that we used the same bank,

566
00:29:50.076 --> 00:29:55.426
so I emailed my banker and
sat down with him for a cup

567
00:29:55.426 --> 00:29:57.856
of coffee and kind of just
sort of brought it up,

568
00:29:57.856 --> 00:29:59.176
and he was like, oh,
you should meet Tim.

569
00:29:59.436 --> 00:30:01.576
I'm like, yes, yes,
I'd love to meet Tim.

570
00:30:02.386 --> 00:30:03.766
And before I knew it,

571
00:30:03.916 --> 00:30:05.996
I'm hanging out at the
office of Double Fine.

572
00:30:06.676 --> 00:30:10.496
And it turns out Tim had a
daughter, and he was interested

573
00:30:10.496 --> 00:30:11.426
in what we were doing.

574
00:30:11.996 --> 00:30:15.596
So I made the ask, I said,
Tim, would you be willing

575
00:30:15.596 --> 00:30:18.046
to let me film you playing
GoldieBlox with your daughter?

576
00:30:18.636 --> 00:30:19.436
And he said, sure.

577
00:30:20.346 --> 00:30:23.246
So we got them together, filmed
them playing for the first time,

578
00:30:23.246 --> 00:30:26.096
and it was really magical
because she loved it and it was

579
00:30:26.136 --> 00:30:27.566
so cute seeing them
play it together.

580
00:30:27.596 --> 00:30:29.746
It was really a genuine
moment, and we actually put it

581
00:30:29.746 --> 00:30:30.836
in our video as a cameo.

582
00:30:32.696 --> 00:30:36.386
And the day that the Kickstarter
went live, it exploded.

583
00:30:36.786 --> 00:30:40.766
First, Tim Schafer tweeted it to
his 90,000 Kickstarter backers.

584
00:30:41.816 --> 00:30:45.466
Then, as it turned out,
reporters from TechCrunch

585
00:30:45.466 --> 00:30:48.676
and The Atlantic had been
reading my blog the whole time,

586
00:30:48.976 --> 00:30:51.866
and so when our campaign
went live they wrote articles

587
00:30:51.866 --> 00:30:53.126
about it.

588
00:30:53.286 --> 00:30:57.786
Our goal of raising $150,000,
we reached it in only four days.

589
00:30:58.326 --> 00:31:00.076
A friend of mine who
works at Facebook sent it

590
00:31:00.076 --> 00:31:02.556
to Sheryl Sandberg, and
she became a backer.

591
00:31:03.126 --> 00:31:06.796
My aunt knew someone who knew
someone, who knew Craig Newmark

592
00:31:06.796 --> 00:31:10.176
of Craigslist, he backed
it and he tweeted it.

593
00:31:10.606 --> 00:31:15.266
So it just totally exploded,
and the craziest thing is

594
00:31:15.266 --> 00:31:17.416
that Upworthy posted the video,

595
00:31:17.416 --> 00:31:21.076
and it went so viral
online we ended

596
00:31:21.076 --> 00:31:23.196
up selling almost
a million dollars

597
00:31:23.336 --> 00:31:25.106
of GoldieBlox in preorders.

598
00:31:26.006 --> 00:31:27.976
It was overwhelming,
to say the least.

599
00:31:28.516 --> 00:31:34.986
[ Applause ]

600
00:31:35.486 --> 00:31:37.016
And I finally had
money in the bank.

601
00:31:37.016 --> 00:31:41.126
I made my first hire, Lindsey,
she left her job, took the leap,

602
00:31:41.126 --> 00:31:45.306
came onboard, and the next day
we got an email from Toys R Us,

603
00:31:46.416 --> 00:31:48.466
which led us to our
next audacious goal:

604
00:31:48.866 --> 00:31:51.236
disrupt the pink aisle.

605
00:31:52.416 --> 00:31:54.636
So Toys R Us calls
and they said,

606
00:31:54.636 --> 00:31:55.676
we'd like to meet with you.

607
00:31:55.926 --> 00:31:59.976
So Lindsey and I get on a plane
and we fly to Wayne, New Jersey,

608
00:32:00.546 --> 00:32:03.646
and we get into the meeting

609
00:32:03.646 --> 00:32:07.246
with these Toys R Us
executives, these men in suits.

610
00:32:07.576 --> 00:32:10.026
And in part of the Kickstarter
video, I was skulking

611
00:32:10.026 --> 00:32:12.776
through the pink aisle holding
up a picture of GoldieBlox next

612
00:32:12.776 --> 00:32:16.006
to Barbie, it was
obviously like at Toys R Us.

613
00:32:16.006 --> 00:32:19.346
And the Toys R Us guys were
like, so what's up with

614
00:32:19.756 --> 00:32:21.096
that part in your video

615
00:32:21.256 --> 00:32:23.776
where you're making
us look really bad?

616
00:32:24.446 --> 00:32:25.786
I'm like, sorry.

617
00:32:26.416 --> 00:32:28.946
And it turned out that the
head construction toy buyer

618
00:32:28.946 --> 00:32:32.106
at Toys R Us had two daughters,
and he said, you know,

619
00:32:32.186 --> 00:32:33.456
GoldieBlox is the
kind of product

620
00:32:33.456 --> 00:32:34.736
that I want for my girls.

621
00:32:35.346 --> 00:32:38.456
And sure enough, six months
later we're on the shelves

622
00:32:38.456 --> 00:32:40.276
of Toys R Us nationwide.

623
00:32:41.266 --> 00:32:44.486
I remember going in there
and looking at our products

624
00:32:44.486 --> 00:32:47.736
on the shelf for the first
time, and I had tears in my eyes

625
00:32:47.846 --> 00:32:50.436
because we had set this
audacious goal, yes,

626
00:32:50.566 --> 00:32:53.766
we'll be in Toys R Us, and
never thought it would happen

627
00:32:53.766 --> 00:32:56.566
so quickly, that all of
that hard work and passion

628
00:32:56.566 --> 00:32:59.796
and belief could
actually happen.

629
00:33:00.856 --> 00:33:04.016
But at the same time
it was pretty rough,

630
00:33:04.506 --> 00:33:08.276
we started to get sales reports
in, and just because you're

631
00:33:08.276 --> 00:33:10.436
in Toys R Us nationwide
doesn't mean

632
00:33:10.436 --> 00:33:13.646
that people are necessarily
going to buy it.

633
00:33:13.816 --> 00:33:18.116
And it wasn't looking good,
the toys weren't selling.

634
00:33:18.116 --> 00:33:20.766
So we asked the Toys R Us
team, you know, what can we do,

635
00:33:20.766 --> 00:33:22.926
how do we get more
people to buy GoldieBlox?

636
00:33:23.466 --> 00:33:25.476
And they said, well, most brands

637
00:33:25.476 --> 00:33:29.886
in our store will do national
TV advertising for a minimum

638
00:33:29.886 --> 00:33:31.686
of a $2 million buy, you know,

639
00:33:31.686 --> 00:33:33.116
you might be able
to move the needle.

640
00:33:34.316 --> 00:33:35.486
Two million dollars?

641
00:33:36.536 --> 00:33:39.846
That was definitely
not an option, right?

642
00:33:40.266 --> 00:33:42.716
But we did have 5,000
Kickstarter backers

643
00:33:43.166 --> 00:33:45.526
and we had my husband, Beau,
who knew how to make a video.

644
00:33:46.316 --> 00:33:49.466
So we decided we've got to
make our own commercial.

645
00:33:49.796 --> 00:33:52.106
And maybe we can't put it
on TV, but you know what,

646
00:33:52.106 --> 00:33:53.526
we can put it up on YouTube.

647
00:33:54.116 --> 00:33:56.636
So we're going to disrupt
the pink aisle ourselves.

648
00:33:57.906 --> 00:34:01.536
We reached out to all of our
Kickstarter backers and we came

649
00:34:01.536 --> 00:34:05.806
up with this idea, let's shoot
a video having girls rampaging

650
00:34:05.806 --> 00:34:07.516
through the pink
aisle at Toys R Us,

651
00:34:08.146 --> 00:34:12.106
singing "We Are The Champions,"
like this is awesome.

652
00:34:12.696 --> 00:34:15.085
So we called up our Kickstarter
backers, and we said meet us

653
00:34:15.085 --> 00:34:17.636
in the parking lot of Toys
R Us, we've got an idea.

654
00:34:18.846 --> 00:34:20.766
So about 50 kids and
their parents showed

655
00:34:20.976 --> 00:34:24.846
up at the Toys R Us parking
lot in the blazing heat.

656
00:34:24.846 --> 00:34:28.186
And, by the way, we didn't
exactly have permission

657
00:34:28.186 --> 00:34:32.456
from Toys R Us to do this, so
we were just trying to lay low,

658
00:34:33.646 --> 00:34:35.936
which definitely didn't happen

659
00:34:35.936 --> 00:34:38.436
because within minutes the
security vehicles started

660
00:34:38.476 --> 00:34:39.936
circling us.

661
00:34:40.315 --> 00:34:42.886
And I'm like, oh, my God, we're
totally going to get arrested,

662
00:34:42.886 --> 00:34:45.346
we're going to get busted,
and these parents are going

663
00:34:45.346 --> 00:34:46.706
to be like, who are you people?

664
00:34:47.416 --> 00:34:50.775
And then the manager of Toys R
Us comes out with his clipboard,

665
00:34:50.926 --> 00:34:52.496
and now I know we're doomed.

666
00:34:52.886 --> 00:34:55.186
And he looks at me, he's
like, who is in charge here?

667
00:34:55.306 --> 00:34:57.246
Like, what's going on?

668
00:34:57.826 --> 00:35:00.286
And I said, well, we're the
Ada Lovelace Girls Club,

669
00:35:00.656 --> 00:35:02.416
and we're on a field trip
to our favorite place

670
00:35:02.416 --> 00:35:04.586
in the world, Toys R Us.

671
00:35:04.726 --> 00:35:06.516
Smiling. He kind of looks at me,

672
00:35:06.716 --> 00:35:09.456
raises and eyebrow,
silence passes.

673
00:35:10.606 --> 00:35:13.356
He says, why didn't you
tell me you were coming?

674
00:35:13.666 --> 00:35:16.106
I don't know if we
have enough gift bags.

675
00:35:16.746 --> 00:35:19.946
Turns around, runs back into
the store, comes back out,

676
00:35:19.946 --> 00:35:23.596
there's a guy dressed up
as Geoffrey the Giraffe.

677
00:35:23.976 --> 00:35:27.056
We bring all the girls in, they
announce on the loudspeaker,

678
00:35:27.056 --> 00:35:29.056
welcome, the Ada
Lovelace Girls Club!

679
00:35:29.306 --> 00:35:32.776
And we set up our camera,
we get the girls running

680
00:35:32.776 --> 00:35:35.706
down the aisle, we get the shot,
and then we run out of there

681
00:35:35.706 --> 00:35:36.976
as fast as we possibly can.

682

[ Applause ]

683
00:35:45.696 --> 00:35:48.246
We post the video on
YouTube, and it went viral.

684
00:35:48.786 --> 00:35:50.886
Forbes picked it up
with the headline,

685
00:35:51.236 --> 00:35:55.256
GoldieBlox Wins Toys R Us and
Quests to Redecorate Pink Aisle

686
00:35:55.256 --> 00:35:57.156
with Engineering Kits for Girls.

687
00:35:57.906 --> 00:36:01.376
And Toys R Us, they were a
little annoyed at us at first,

688
00:36:01.716 --> 00:36:05.296
but they saw what a great story
it was and they got behind it

689
00:36:05.296 --> 00:36:06.986
and they shared it
with their customers.

690
00:36:06.986 --> 00:36:10.996
And before we knew it, finally
our toys started to sell.

691
00:36:10.996 --> 00:36:13.586
So this little video thing
was working out for us,

692
00:36:13.816 --> 00:36:17.146
so much so in fact that my
husband, Beau, actually left,

693
00:36:17.756 --> 00:36:20.546
sold his video company
to come to GoldieBlox

694
00:36:20.666 --> 00:36:25.196
and take his video-making
powers and use them for good.

695
00:36:25.686 --> 00:36:28.796
And we decided, okay, what's
our next video going to be,

696
00:36:28.796 --> 00:36:30.416
we've got to come up
with a video that's going

697
00:36:30.416 --> 00:36:32.876
to make engineering
so cool for girls.

698
00:36:33.446 --> 00:36:38.066
So over a lunch of margaritas
we started brainstorming,

699
00:36:38.566 --> 00:36:40.006
and we came up with this idea.

700
00:36:40.926 --> 00:36:43.146
So we were all big fans

701
00:36:43.146 --> 00:36:45.896
of the OK Go Rube
Goldberg-machine music video,

702
00:36:46.156 --> 00:36:47.916
we're like Rube Goldberg
machine,

703
00:36:47.916 --> 00:36:49.746
that makes engineering
cool, right?

704
00:36:50.346 --> 00:36:52.056
But how will we make
it cool for girls?

705
00:36:52.056 --> 00:36:55.606
So we came up with making
a Rube Goldberg machine

706
00:36:55.606 --> 00:36:59.646
out of entirely stereotypical,
sexist, pink-aisle toys.

707
00:36:59.646 --> 00:37:03.866
And then we thought,
what if we set the video

708
00:37:03.866 --> 00:37:05.556
to the Beastie Boys
song "Girls,"

709
00:37:05.556 --> 00:37:08.916
but we flipped the lyrics,
so instead of "girls

710
00:37:08.916 --> 00:37:12.086
to do the laundry," it could be
"girls to build the spaceship"

711
00:37:12.086 --> 00:37:13.446
or "girls to code the new app."

712
00:37:14.246 --> 00:37:17.966
Well, we were so excited
about this idea after the end

713
00:37:18.206 --> 00:37:20.736
of the lunch we were all high
fiving, we were like, yes,

714
00:37:21.226 --> 00:37:22.676
this is the best idea ever.

715
00:37:23.356 --> 00:37:26.466
And then the crazy thing
is we actually did it,

716
00:37:26.666 --> 00:37:28.266
so we created our own luck

717
00:37:28.966 --> 00:37:31.416
and we started serial
killer-style stalking

718
00:37:31.486 --> 00:37:34.546
to find one of the engineers
from the OK Go music video.

719
00:37:35.106 --> 00:37:36.336
And we actually found one,

720
00:37:36.626 --> 00:37:38.506
we told him about it,
and he was pumped.

721
00:37:38.506 --> 00:37:41.746
He said, yes, let's do it.

722
00:37:41.746 --> 00:37:45.436
We rented a house, an
Airbnb in Pasadena,

723
00:37:45.606 --> 00:37:48.186
we actually removed all of
the furniture from the house

724
00:37:48.646 --> 00:37:51.556
so that we could build a
giant princess machine.

725
00:37:51.836 --> 00:37:55.106
Going through every room of
the house, out by the pool,

726
00:37:55.106 --> 00:37:57.436
in the garage, out the backdoor.

727
00:37:58.016 --> 00:38:01.326
We got three of our original
Kickstarter girls to star

728
00:38:01.326 --> 00:38:04.686
in the video, which started with
them watching this ultra-sappy,

729
00:38:04.686 --> 00:38:07.826
girlie commercial on
TV, not looking amused,

730
00:38:07.896 --> 00:38:10.716
so then they deploy the
Rube Goldberg machine.

731
00:38:10.716 --> 00:38:12.856
And it winds its way
all through the house

732
00:38:12.856 --> 00:38:15.076
until finally coming back
in through the living room,

733
00:38:15.276 --> 00:38:17.766
hitting a frying pan,
going straight at the TV,

734
00:38:17.766 --> 00:38:19.706
turning the channel
to GoldieBlox.

735
00:38:20.816 --> 00:38:24.316
We posted the video online,
and within a week it had

736
00:38:24.316 --> 00:38:25.686
over 12 million views.

737
00:38:25.686 --> 00:38:28.936
It was on the Today Show,
Good Morning America,

738
00:38:29.526 --> 00:38:32.266
Ellen is tweeting it, Chelsea
Clinton is tweeting it,

739
00:38:32.266 --> 00:38:33.716
everyone is going insane.

740
00:38:34.186 --> 00:38:38.266
It was unbelievable
until we found

741
00:38:38.266 --> 00:38:41.046
out that the Beastie Boys were
not very amused with this video.

742
00:38:42.426 --> 00:38:46.756
And we went from literally the
highest of highs to the lowest

743
00:38:46.756 --> 00:38:51.316
of lows in an instant
and ended up having

744
00:38:51.316 --> 00:38:53.306
to face a really public lawsuit.

745
00:38:54.066 --> 00:38:56.816
We worked as hard as we could
to settle it, which we did,

746
00:38:57.506 --> 00:39:02.906
but in that low, low time we
had to keep pushing forward.

747
00:39:03.256 --> 00:39:03.726
What's next?

748
00:39:04.426 --> 00:39:06.316
How do we keep disrupting
the pink aisle,

749
00:39:06.426 --> 00:39:07.396
staying on our mission,

750
00:39:07.396 --> 00:39:09.506
and making engineering
cool for girls?

751
00:39:10.156 --> 00:39:12.356
And then the opportunity
of a lifetime came.

752
00:39:13.526 --> 00:39:15.746
We found out that Intuit
was running a program

753
00:39:15.986 --> 00:39:18.286
where one small business
could win a free Super

754
00:39:18.286 --> 00:39:19.006
Bowl commercial.

755
00:39:20.106 --> 00:39:21.306
And I couldn't help but think,

756
00:39:21.656 --> 00:39:24.266
all of those old dinosaur
toy people who said

757
00:39:24.476 --> 00:39:28.386
that GoldieBlox would never go
mainstream, this was our chance,

758
00:39:28.526 --> 00:39:30.796
and this was our fate, right?

759
00:39:31.316 --> 00:39:32.416
I knew we deserved to win,

760
00:39:32.416 --> 00:39:35.816
so our whole company got
onboard, all 12 of us.

761
00:39:36.096 --> 00:39:38.176
We made it our number
one company priority,

762
00:39:38.646 --> 00:39:42.056
and every single day we begged
our fans, we posted pictures --

763
00:39:42.056 --> 00:39:43.706
Vote for GoldieBlox,
Vote for GoldieBlox.

764
00:39:44.396 --> 00:39:48.826
And the amazing thing was
that when we went at it

765
00:39:49.016 --> 00:39:51.346
and we reached out to people,
just like we had done back

766
00:39:51.346 --> 00:39:54.386
in the days of Kickstarter,
people voted and they shared.

767
00:39:54.576 --> 00:39:56.446
And we actually ended
up winning.

768
00:39:57.086 --> 00:40:01.116
So last year in the Super Bowl,
which is traditionally one

769
00:40:01.116 --> 00:40:03.806
of the most sexist,
male-dominated ad slots

770
00:40:03.976 --> 00:40:06.156
in the world, we had a pack

771
00:40:06.156 --> 00:40:08.886
of girls grabbing
their pink-aisle toys,

772
00:40:09.266 --> 00:40:11.976
racing into a park where
they built them into a rocket

773
00:40:11.976 --> 00:40:14.486
and shot them into outer space.

774
00:40:15.516 --> 00:40:22.576
[ Applause ]

775
00:40:23.076 --> 00:40:25.156
Well, we were on
top of the world,

776
00:40:25.686 --> 00:40:29.496
but then my biggest
fear became a reality.

777
00:40:29.596 --> 00:40:31.896
We had a problem
with the product.

778
00:40:33.446 --> 00:40:36.346
We were making the toys
so fast to meet the demand

779
00:40:36.346 --> 00:40:38.646
of all the viral videos and
the Super Bowl commercial

780
00:40:39.016 --> 00:40:43.146
that we started facing
quality issues, and the holes

781
00:40:43.146 --> 00:40:45.546
in our blocks were a
little bit too loose,

782
00:40:46.266 --> 00:40:50.056
like 0.0001 millimeters
too loose.

783
00:40:50.266 --> 00:40:52.466
And even though that
sounds really small,

784
00:40:52.866 --> 00:40:55.246
it had catastrophic results
because what happened was

785
00:40:55.246 --> 00:40:57.686
that girls would get frustrated
and they wouldn't want to build,

786
00:40:57.716 --> 00:40:58.676
even though they were excited.

787
00:40:58.676 --> 00:41:03.266
And so we had to set
another audacious goal:

788
00:41:03.476 --> 00:41:05.316
replace every single block.

789
00:41:06.366 --> 00:41:08.906
We decided we've got
to tackle this head-on.

790
00:41:08.956 --> 00:41:11.616
It was easy to fix the blocks,
we began to do this right away,

791
00:41:11.706 --> 00:41:12.606
that wasn't the issue.

792
00:41:12.876 --> 00:41:15.166
It was that there were hundreds
of thousands of these blocks

793
00:41:15.696 --> 00:41:18.486
out in the market, and how
were we going to convince girls

794
00:41:18.486 --> 00:41:19.346
to give us a second try?

795
00:41:20.626 --> 00:41:23.046
So we decided to reach out
to every single customer

796
00:41:23.046 --> 00:41:24.926
that we possibly
could and tell them

797
00:41:24.926 --> 00:41:26.576
that we would send them
new blocks for free.

798
00:41:27.206 --> 00:41:28.256
We made a huge investment.

799
00:41:28.686 --> 00:41:29.596
We didn't have to do it.

800
00:41:29.596 --> 00:41:30.906
It wasn't a product recall.

801
00:41:30.906 --> 00:41:32.126
But it was the right
thing to do.

802
00:41:32.126 --> 00:41:34.566
And then we took
it a step further.

803
00:41:35.486 --> 00:41:38.486
We got the name of every
single kid who had bought it

804
00:41:38.856 --> 00:41:40.796
and wrote them a
personalized letter

805
00:41:40.946 --> 00:41:44.496
from Goldie explaining
the engineering lesson

806
00:41:44.576 --> 00:41:47.176
of how we fixed the block,
that we turned the holes

807
00:41:47.256 --> 00:41:48.976
from a circle shape
into an octogon.

808
00:41:49.516 --> 00:41:57.226
[ Applause ]

809
00:41:57.726 --> 00:41:59.776
And it worked.

810
00:42:00.136 --> 00:42:01.866
The girls thought
Goldie was a real person,

811
00:42:01.866 --> 00:42:04.426
and they sent us letters
back, thanking her

812
00:42:04.766 --> 00:42:06.766
for inspiring them
to become inventors.

813
00:42:07.606 --> 00:42:11.236
So after all this blocks
debacle we were like, gosh,

814
00:42:11.606 --> 00:42:13.896
making hardware is really hard,

815
00:42:14.636 --> 00:42:18.716
and maybe we could reach
more girls digitally,

816
00:42:19.086 --> 00:42:20.116
wouldn't that be great?

817
00:42:20.496 --> 00:42:23.426
And so we came up with
a new audacious plan:

818
00:42:24.156 --> 00:42:27.276
we're going to create
an app and we're going

819
00:42:27.276 --> 00:42:29.536
to use our great stories
and engineering lessons

820
00:42:29.536 --> 00:42:32.456
and scale this digitally,
reach even more girls faster.

821
00:42:33.016 --> 00:42:34.366
And we can't just make any app,

822
00:42:34.586 --> 00:42:36.636
we've got to put an
audacious goal around it.

823
00:42:36.726 --> 00:42:39.686
So we're going to make an app
that gets featured by Apple.

824
00:42:40.646 --> 00:42:43.526
So we made our first hire
on the mobile space, Kyle.

[ Applause ]

826
00:42:49.236 --> 00:42:54.466
Hi, Kyle. Making an app was
not easy, let me tell you.

827
00:42:54.696 --> 00:42:57.066
What started as an ebook
turned into a monster.

828
00:42:57.606 --> 00:43:00.416
We had feature creep,
is what they call it.

829
00:43:00.696 --> 00:43:03.276
But Kyle was not going to
give up, he's like we're going

830
00:43:03.276 --> 00:43:05.296
to get this featured
by Apple, I promise,

831
00:43:05.686 --> 00:43:09.906
and if we do I will
get a tattoo.

832
00:43:09.906 --> 00:43:14.496
So to make a very long story
short, including a drive

833
00:43:14.496 --> 00:43:17.786
to Cupertino, where we had to
activate wireless tethering

834
00:43:17.786 --> 00:43:20.436
for Kyle's cell phone so that
he could download the build

835
00:43:20.436 --> 00:43:24.286
and code it in the car,
demoing it to Apple,

836
00:43:24.286 --> 00:43:26.466
and none of us could
believe it actually worked.

837
00:43:27.216 --> 00:43:28.346
We launched this thing,

838
00:43:28.556 --> 00:43:31.546
and multiple hotfixes later
we got featured by Apple

839
00:43:31.546 --> 00:43:32.776
and Kyle got his tattoo.

And so now without further
ado, I'm going to walk you

842
00:43:42.836 --> 00:43:45.576
through this product that
sent us to the tattoo parlor,

843
00:43:46.376 --> 00:43:49.566
and it's our first product
so I'm really proud of --

844
00:43:49.606 --> 00:43:51.396
it's called GoldieBlox
and the Movie Machine,

845
00:43:51.396 --> 00:43:54.396
and it blends digital
and physical and story.

846
00:43:54.836 --> 00:43:57.596
And so as we learned
with all of our research,

847
00:43:58.236 --> 00:44:00.456
the way to really engage
girls really starts

848
00:44:00.456 --> 00:44:01.366
with a great story.

849
00:44:02.646 --> 00:44:04.886
So in our story we
start with Goldie.

850
00:44:05.546 --> 00:44:09.226
She's not a princess and she's
not really a genius either,

851
00:44:09.836 --> 00:44:12.536
but she's an inventor
who loves building even

852
00:44:12.536 --> 00:44:14.056
if she gets it wrong
half the time.

853
00:44:15.096 --> 00:44:18.666
So one day Goldie finds out that
the Bloxtown Film Festival is

854
00:44:18.666 --> 00:44:21.086
cancelled because the
projector is broken.

855
00:44:21.646 --> 00:44:22.896
So her and her friends decide,

856
00:44:23.206 --> 00:44:25.546
we're going to save the
festival with an invention.

857
00:44:26.666 --> 00:44:29.856
After hours of brainstorming,
Goldie comes up with the idea

858
00:44:29.856 --> 00:44:32.376
to build a zoetrope,
it's the first pre-cinema

859
00:44:32.546 --> 00:44:33.416
animation device.

860
00:44:34.136 --> 00:44:37.146
Using the engineering
and persistence

861
00:44:37.146 --> 00:44:38.896
of vision science principles,

862
00:44:39.386 --> 00:44:41.316
Goldie and her friends
build a machine

863
00:44:41.316 --> 00:44:42.896
that creates a moving picture.

864
00:44:43.436 --> 00:44:47.446
Once the machine actually
works, Goldie's friends kind

865
00:44:47.446 --> 00:44:49.796
of realize, hey, there,
Goldie, there's a problem,

866
00:44:50.146 --> 00:44:51.976
this movie is only
a second long.

867
00:44:52.406 --> 00:44:56.066
Another typical Goldie invention
flop, but Goldie sees this

868
00:44:56.066 --> 00:44:57.296
as a golden opportunity.

869
00:44:57.836 --> 00:45:01.366
Why don't we create the first
ever one-second Film Festival

870
00:45:01.366 --> 00:45:03.156
and we'll make a million movies?

871
00:45:04.056 --> 00:45:06.696
And this is how we open up the
world of engineering to kids.

872
00:45:07.266 --> 00:45:10.456
With our construction set
kids can build a real working

873
00:45:10.456 --> 00:45:11.886
zoetrope with our pieces.

874
00:45:12.506 --> 00:45:15.186
The pieces are inspired by
common household objects,

875
00:45:15.886 --> 00:45:19.686
stuff from the hardware store,
the arts and crafts section.

876
00:45:19.916 --> 00:45:21.886
What helps with making
these pieces feel

877
00:45:21.886 --> 00:45:24.086
like common household
objects is it makes kids start

878
00:45:24.086 --> 00:45:25.756
to see the world
as their toolbox,

879
00:45:25.756 --> 00:45:27.586
that they can really
invent anything.

880
00:45:27.586 --> 00:45:30.476
But then what really
brings the experience

881
00:45:30.546 --> 00:45:34.706
to life is our mobile app,
with drawing tools, stamps,

882
00:45:35.186 --> 00:45:37.396
stop motion photography
and backgrounds,

883
00:45:37.796 --> 00:45:40.096
kids can make their
own movies digitally,

884
00:45:40.466 --> 00:45:43.476
and then they can air print
them if they want to play

885
00:45:43.586 --> 00:45:46.246
in their actual zoetrope
movie machine device,

886
00:45:46.756 --> 00:45:48.646
they can email them,
they can text them,

887
00:45:49.176 --> 00:45:51.716
or they can even send
it to the Apple Watch.

888

[ Applause ]

889
00:46:00.076 --> 00:46:03.046
And there, Mom and Dad can give
them a star for a job well done.

890
00:46:03.926 --> 00:46:06.536
What's so cool is to see
what this app has inspired,

891
00:46:07.006 --> 00:46:10.486
you never can guess what
kids are going to make,

892
00:46:10.786 --> 00:46:12.796
and it's pretty extraordinary.

893
00:46:13.106 --> 00:46:16.696
Actually, kids have made
over a million movies

894
00:46:17.106 --> 00:46:18.416
in this app that we launched.

895
00:46:18.576 --> 00:46:22.896
And it's so rewarding to see
how girls can get excited

896
00:46:22.986 --> 00:46:25.966
to invent things and build
cool stuff, and it's awesome

897
00:46:25.966 --> 00:46:27.636
to be a part of that
and give them the tools

898
00:46:27.636 --> 00:46:30.686
and encouragement to do that.

899
00:46:31.226 --> 00:46:32.716
So where do we go next?

900
00:46:33.716 --> 00:46:35.686
How do you go from here?

901
00:46:36.176 --> 00:46:38.046
We've hit a lot of
audacious goals, right?

902
00:46:38.706 --> 00:46:41.406
Well, the thing about having
audacious goals is once you hit

903
00:46:41.406 --> 00:46:45.016
one and you know it's possible,
you set out a bigger one

904
00:46:45.016 --> 00:46:46.256
and an even bigger one.

905
00:46:46.846 --> 00:46:48.696
And that's certainly
what my team is doing.

906
00:46:49.296 --> 00:46:52.066
We've got a ton of audacious
goals that we want to hit next.

907
00:46:52.876 --> 00:46:56.556
Now we probably won't hit all
of these, but we're never going

908
00:46:56.556 --> 00:46:59.066
to stop shooting for the
moon, like, literally,

909
00:46:59.176 --> 00:47:01.116
first doll on the moon is
actually one of our goals.

910
00:47:01.956 --> 00:47:04.906
And how can we be so audacious?

911
00:47:04.906 --> 00:47:08.526
Well, it's because at the end of
the day, the mission is greater

912
00:47:08.526 --> 00:47:11.026
than our company, and I
never feel embarrassed going

913
00:47:11.066 --> 00:47:13.966
and asking somebody for help
or asking somebody to be a part

914
00:47:13.966 --> 00:47:15.796
of it because it's
bigger than all of us.

915
00:47:16.336 --> 00:47:20.066
We really believe in it,
and I'm reminded every day

916
00:47:20.066 --> 00:47:24.456
that it's working because
every day we see evidence

917
00:47:24.856 --> 00:47:26.716
of girls getting
inspired by GoldieBlox.

918
00:47:27.566 --> 00:47:31.296
Recently I got a letter from
a mom, she was telling me

919
00:47:31.296 --> 00:47:35.066
that her daughter was not
excited to go to science camp,

920
00:47:35.676 --> 00:47:37.926
that every morning her
daughter would whine and whine

921
00:47:37.926 --> 00:47:39.636
and she'd have to
drag her to camp.

922
00:47:39.636 --> 00:47:40.746
Her daughter didn't want to go

923
00:47:40.746 --> 00:47:42.656
because the camp
was almost all boys.

924
00:47:43.746 --> 00:47:46.816
And then her mom bought her
GoldieBlox and they played it

925
00:47:46.816 --> 00:47:48.566
over the weekend
together, they had a blast.

926
00:47:49.436 --> 00:47:51.626
On Monday they were
getting ready to go to camp,

927
00:47:51.626 --> 00:47:54.896
and her daughter wasn't
having her usual crying fit.

928
00:47:55.946 --> 00:47:59.226
And her Mom asked her what's
going on with you, you know,

929
00:47:59.976 --> 00:48:03.066
what's going on, and why aren't
you nervous about camp anymore?

930
00:48:03.446 --> 00:48:06.406
And her daughter said, oh, Mom,
I'm not nervous about camp,

931
00:48:06.406 --> 00:48:09.486
I've got GoldieBlox,
I'm all set.

932
00:48:09.816 --> 00:48:12.346
And I know it sounds like
I'm making this story up,

933
00:48:12.346 --> 00:48:14.656
but I'm actually not,
like, this really happened.

934
00:48:15.056 --> 00:48:19.516
And it's amazing because with
GoldieBlox we're starting

935
00:48:19.516 --> 00:48:21.486
to give these girls
a role model,

936
00:48:21.666 --> 00:48:25.106
somebody who they can
see themselves being.

937
00:48:25.426 --> 00:48:27.956
And we're not just teaching
them some engineering lessons,

938
00:48:28.016 --> 00:48:30.156
but we're actually
giving them confidence.

939
00:48:30.156 --> 00:48:32.846
And that's what we,
all of us here,

940
00:48:32.846 --> 00:48:35.196
have the opportunity to do.

941
00:48:35.706 --> 00:48:39.166
We can help kids shape the
way that they see the world,

942
00:48:39.876 --> 00:48:41.726
whether it's the
products that we build

943
00:48:41.886 --> 00:48:44.236
or just the things
that we say to kids.

944
00:48:44.236 --> 00:48:47.926
I mean think about it, every
time you see a little girl

945
00:48:47.926 --> 00:48:49.606
and you tell her that
she looks beautiful,

946
00:48:50.146 --> 00:48:51.596
imagine what a difference
it would make

947
00:48:51.596 --> 00:48:54.886
if you said she looks capable?

948
00:49:02.056 --> 00:49:05.136
Or every time you're
making a game or a movie

949
00:49:05.136 --> 00:49:09.646
and you're choosing a hero and
you automatically make it a boy,

950
00:49:10.736 --> 00:49:12.836
what if you made it
a girl, you know?

951
00:49:13.656 --> 00:49:15.656
Sometimes we propagate
gender stereotypes

952
00:49:15.656 --> 00:49:18.756
and we don't even realize
it, but the cool thing is

953
00:49:19.216 --> 00:49:20.846
that we have the
opportunity to change that.

954
00:49:21.676 --> 00:49:24.226
There's no pink or blue
aisle in the App Store,

955
00:49:24.396 --> 00:49:28.086
and we get to put stuff
out there that, you know,

956
00:49:28.086 --> 00:49:30.746
kids are so impressionable,
we can put stuff

957
00:49:30.746 --> 00:49:32.576
out there that's going to
make them see the world

958
00:49:32.576 --> 00:49:33.276
in a whole new way.

959
00:49:33.446 --> 00:49:36.946
And if we do that, and if you
all join me on this mission,

960
00:49:37.916 --> 00:49:40.676
we can achieve my last and
final audacious goal --

961
00:49:41.536 --> 00:49:44.596
that sometime in our
own lifetime 50 percent

962
00:49:44.806 --> 00:49:46.586
of WWDC is women.

963
00:49:47.506 --> 00:49:47.976
Thank you.
