10453
00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:40.410
underground structure spanning
many city blocks, and so we

10454
00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:40.677
many city blocks, and so we

00:49:41.712 --> 00:49:41.912
many city blocks, and so we
carefully s

10457
00:49:41.912 --> 00:49:42.779
many city blocks, and so we
carefully surveyed

10458
00:49:42.779 --> 00:49:43.313
many city blocks, and so we
carefully surveyed all

so you are able to

14729
01:09:59.762 --> 01:10:00.362
needed for that user's device,
so you are able to get

14730
01:10:00.362 --> 01:10:00.396
needed for that user's device,
so you are able to get -

14731
01:10:00.396 --> 01:10:00.496

so you are able to get -- take
less space on device.

14738
01:10:01.564 --> 01:10:01.664
so you are able to get -- take
less space on device. It's

14739
01:10:01.664 --> 01:10:01.864
less space on device. It's

14740
01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:02.231

should be everywhere and

15457
01:13:43.318 --> 01:13:44.787
come. And we think Swift
should be everywhere and used

15458
01:13:44.787 --> 01:13:44.920
should be everywhere and used

15459
01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:45.120
should be everywhere and used
by

15460
01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:45.187
should be everywhere and used
by everyone

15461
01:13:45.187 --> 01:13:45.320
should be everywhere and used
by everyone,

15462
01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:45.687
should be everywhere and used
by everyone, and

15463
01:13:45.687 --> 01:13:45.921
should be everywhere and used
by everyone, and so

15464
01:13:45.921 --> 01:13:46.288
should be everywhere and used
by everyone, and so we're

15465
01:13:46.288 --> 01:13:46.321
should be everywhere and used
by everyone, and so we're going

15466
01:13:46.321 --> 01:13:46.422
by everyone, and so we're going

15467
01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:46.522

So that's

15537
01:14:31.834 --> 01:14:32.067
there by the end of the year.
So that's Swift,

15538
01:14:32.067 --> 01:14:32.534
there by the end of the year.
So that's Swift, and

15539
01:14:32.534 --> 01:14:32.634
there by the end of the year.
So that's Swift, and that

15540
01:14:32.634 --> 01:14:32.701
there by the end of the year.
So that's Swift, and that is

15541
01:14:32.701 --> 01:14:32.868
So that's Swift, and that is

15542
01:14:32.868 --> 01:14:33.101
So that's Swift, and that is
iOS

15543
01:14:33.101 --> 01:14:33.635
So that's Swift, and that is
iOS 9.

15544
01:14:33.635 --> 01:14:33.669
So that's Swift, and that is
iOS 9. W

15545
01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:33.735
So that's Swift, and that is
iOS 9. We

15546
01:14:33.735 --> 01:14:33.936
So that's Swift, and that is
iOS 9. We are

15547
01:14:33.936 --> 01:14:34.136
So that's Swift, and that is
iOS 9. We are doing

15548
01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:34.703
So that's Swift, and that is
iOS 9. We are doing a

20152
01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:53.040
You will be able to access the
Accelerometer so

20153
01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:53.174
You will be able to access the
Accelerometer so you

20154
01:36:53.174 --> 01:36:53.541
You will be able to access the
Accelerometer so you can

20155
01:36:53.541 --> 01:36:53.607
You will be able to access the
Accelerometer so you can get

20156
01:36:53.607 --> 01:36:53.808
Accelerometer so you can get

20157
01:36:53.808 --> 01:36:53.808
Accelerometer so you can get

20158
01:36:53.808 --> 01:36:53.874
Accelerometer so you can get
movement

20159
01:36:53.874 --> 01:36:53.974
Accelerometer so you can get
movement d

20160
01:36:53.974 --> 01:36:54.875
Accelerometer so you can get
movement data.

20161
01:36:54.875 --> 01:36:54.909
Accelerometer so you can get
movement data. S

20162
01:36:54.909 --> 01:36:54.975
Accelerometer so you can get
movement data. So

20163
01:36:54.975 --> 01:36:55.176
Accelerometer so you can get
movement data. So for

20164
01:36:55.176 --> 01:36:55.709
Accelerometer so you can get
movement data. So for example,

20165
01:36:55.709 --> 01:36:55.876
movement data. So for example,

20166
01:36:55.876 --> 01:36:55.910
movement data. So for example,
from

20167
01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:56.010
movement data. So for example,
from a

20168
01:36:56.010 --> 01:36:56.076
movement data. So for example,
from a ping

20169
01:36:56.076 --> 01:36:56.143
movement data. So for example,
from a ping g

20170
01:36:56.143 --> 01:36:56.277
movement data. So for example,
from a ping golf

20171
01:36:56.277 --> 01:36:56.477
movement data. So for example,
from a ping golf app

20172
01:36:56.477 --> 01:36:56.610
movement data. So for example,
from a ping golf app h

20173
01:36:56.610 --> 01:36:56.710
movement data. So for example,
from a ping golf app here,

20174
01:36:56.710 --> 01:36:57.111
movement data. So for example,
from a ping golf app here, you
