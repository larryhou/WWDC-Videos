[ Silence ]

00:00:12.046 --> 00:00:12.196
>> All right.

3
00:00:12.296 --> 00:00:12.976
Good morning, everyone.

4
00:00:13.516 --> 00:00:15.556
[ Applause ]

5
00:00:16.056 --> 00:00:17.916
Welcome to Session 511.

6
00:00:17.916 --> 00:00:20.356
This is the "Introduction
to the Photos Frameworks",

7
00:00:20.426 --> 00:00:22.206
collectively known as PhotoKit.

8
00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:24.846
And my name is Adam Swift.

9
00:00:25.146 --> 00:00:26.106
No jokes, please.

10
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:30.066
I'm a software engineer on the
iOS Photos Frameworks Team.

11
00:00:32.436 --> 00:00:33.046
All right.

12
00:00:33.046 --> 00:00:34.446
So, we're really excited

13
00:00:34.446 --> 00:00:37.616
about introducing you
to PhotoKit today.

14
00:00:37.616 --> 00:00:40.606
PhotoKit is comprised
of two frameworks.

15
00:00:40.606 --> 00:00:42.736
The first framework is
the Photos Framework,

16
00:00:43.046 --> 00:00:46.716
which gives you access
to the photos and videos

17
00:00:46.896 --> 00:00:48.656
from the user's photo library.

18
00:00:49.436 --> 00:00:52.066
And you can use it to
build a full-featured app

19
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:54.196
like the built-in
Photos application.

20
00:00:54.976 --> 00:00:57.836
The second framework is
the Photos UI framework,

21
00:00:58.186 --> 00:01:00.316
and this is a framework
that will allow you

22
00:00:58.186 --> 00:01:00.316
and this is a framework
that will allow you

23
00:01:00.316 --> 00:01:03.646
to build a photo editing
extension, app extension,

24
00:01:03.876 --> 00:01:06.726
that can be used right within
the built-in Photos app.

25
00:01:09.716 --> 00:01:12.966
So, in this session we're
going to focus first

26
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:17.196
on how you can use the
Photos Framework to fetch

27
00:01:17.196 --> 00:01:19.146
and manipulate photo
library model data,

28
00:01:19.606 --> 00:01:23.786
handle external changes, and
both retrieve and edit photo

29
00:01:23.786 --> 00:01:26.806
and video content in
the iOS 8 photo library.

30
00:01:28.046 --> 00:01:29.706
Then we're going to
turn our attention

31
00:01:29.736 --> 00:01:33.596
to the PhotosUI Framework and
walk you through the steps

32
00:01:33.596 --> 00:01:36.296
and the concepts you need
to understand in order

33
00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:38.566
to build your own app extension

34
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:40.546
for editing photo
and video content.

35
00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:43.726
All right.

36
00:01:43.726 --> 00:01:46.146
So, let's get started
with the Photos Framework.

37
00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:53.406
The Photos Framework is a new
Objective-C framework in iOS 8.

38
00:01:54.256 --> 00:01:59.366
And it allows you to make
your application a first-class

39
00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:03.736
citizen of the system photo
library for everything,

40
00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:03.736
citizen of the system photo
library for everything,

41
00:02:03.736 --> 00:02:06.126
from something simple
like a custom image picker

42
00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:08.026
in your application to going

43
00:02:08.026 --> 00:02:11.846
and building a full-featured
custom application

44
00:02:11.846 --> 00:02:14.286
for browsing the photo
library and editing.

45
00:02:15.356 --> 00:02:19.096
And we really believe in this

46
00:02:19.096 --> 00:02:22.746
because we're using the Photos
Framework in our own Photos

47
00:02:22.746 --> 00:02:25.456
and Camera applications
that are built-in in iOS 8.

48
00:02:25.966 --> 00:02:29.036
For those of you who have
worked with photos in the past,

49
00:02:29.726 --> 00:02:31.546
this Photos Framework
is designed

50
00:02:31.596 --> 00:02:33.536
to supersede the
ALAssetsLibrary,

51
00:02:33.536 --> 00:02:34.756
which doesn't provide,

52
00:02:35.516 --> 00:02:41.096
[ Laughter and Applause ]

53
00:02:41.596 --> 00:02:44.126
which doesn't provide much of
the functionality and features

54
00:02:44.126 --> 00:02:45.616
that you'll get with
the Photos Framework.

55
00:02:47.076 --> 00:02:50.626
So what do you get with
the Photos Framework?

56
00:02:50.986 --> 00:02:53.056
You get access to
photo and video assets,

57
00:02:53.056 --> 00:02:56.126
albums and moments,
something you didn't get

58
00:02:56.126 --> 00:02:57.116
with the assets library.

59
00:02:57.676 --> 00:03:03.976
And then you can also
add, remove, modify assets

60
00:02:57.676 --> 00:03:03.976
And then you can also
add, remove, modify assets

61
00:03:03.976 --> 00:03:06.596
and albums right in the
system-wide photo library.

62
00:03:07.286 --> 00:03:12.336
You can then also edit photo
and video content and metadata

63
00:03:12.696 --> 00:03:15.706
that is written directly into
the system photo library.

64
00:03:17.776 --> 00:03:19.086
We're excited about it, too.

65
00:03:19.086 --> 00:03:19.696
That's okay.

66
00:03:20.246 --> 00:03:24.856
So, we're going to walk through
this API in a couple of steps.

67
00:03:24.856 --> 00:03:27.746
The first section is going
to focus on the model data

68
00:03:27.906 --> 00:03:30.486
and this is going to
walk you through how

69
00:03:30.486 --> 00:03:33.746
to fetch the model objects,
how to change model data,

70
00:03:34.116 --> 00:03:35.876
how to handle external changes.

71
00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:38.576
And then we'll turn our
attention to working

72
00:03:38.576 --> 00:03:41.816
with the image and video
content of those assets,

73
00:03:42.686 --> 00:03:46.266
how to retrieve it efficiently,
and tips for working

74
00:03:46.266 --> 00:03:49.646
with different types of image
and video content, and then how

75
00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:51.226
to go ahead and make changes

76
00:03:51.616 --> 00:03:53.556
and apply those back
to the photo library.

77
00:03:54.246 --> 00:03:57.716
So I'm going to start off
looking at model data.

78
00:03:58.506 --> 00:04:01.736
So, model data in the Photos
Framework is represented

79
00:03:58.506 --> 00:04:01.736
So, model data in the Photos
Framework is represented

80
00:04:01.736 --> 00:04:03.586
with what we call model objects.

81
00:04:03.696 --> 00:04:07.006
And these represent the
structure of the photo library.

82
00:04:07.426 --> 00:04:10.196
These are the records
that represent photo

83
00:04:10.196 --> 00:04:13.756
and video assets, moments,
albums and folders.

84
00:04:14.806 --> 00:04:19.086
And the key concept I want you
to take away from this section,

85
00:04:19.755 --> 00:04:23.556
one of the key concepts is that
model objects that are presented

86
00:04:23.556 --> 00:04:25.696
in the Photo Framework
are read-only,

87
00:04:25.926 --> 00:04:30.206
and that is a nice benefit
because it means you can work

88
00:04:30.206 --> 00:04:32.246
with those objects in
a thread-safe manner.

89
00:04:32.246 --> 00:04:34.616
You can pass them between
threads without worrying

90
00:04:34.616 --> 00:04:36.656
about their data changing
out from underneath you.

91
00:04:37.096 --> 00:04:42.086
There's no worries about locking
and handling concurrent changes.

92
00:04:43.476 --> 00:04:47.176
So I'd like to walk through
the different model objects

93
00:04:47.176 --> 00:04:50.876
that we provide with an
illustration using the built-in

94
00:04:50.876 --> 00:04:52.576
iOS 8 Photos application.

95
00:04:53.676 --> 00:04:55.446
So we'll start with the assets.

96
00:04:55.826 --> 00:04:57.106
These are the photos and videos

97
00:04:57.106 --> 00:04:58.926
that you see here
in the Photos App.

98
00:04:58.926 --> 00:05:04.546
And then containing assets,
we have at the next level up,

99
00:04:58.926 --> 00:05:04.546
And then containing assets,
we have at the next level up,

100
00:05:05.086 --> 00:05:07.846
Asset Collections, what
we call Asset Collections

101
00:05:07.846 --> 00:05:08.756
in the Photos Framework.

102
00:05:09.426 --> 00:05:13.236
And in the case we're looking
at a view that shows moments.

103
00:05:13.236 --> 00:05:16.126
And a moment is comprised
of a collection of assets.

104
00:05:16.676 --> 00:05:20.496
At the next level above that,

105
00:05:21.246 --> 00:05:23.566
we have what we call
Collection Lists,

106
00:05:23.896 --> 00:05:26.196
and these are lists
of Asset Collections.

107
00:05:26.606 --> 00:05:28.236
And in the case you're
looking at here,

108
00:05:28.236 --> 00:05:31.526
we're seeing the year moment
view, which is comprised

109
00:05:31.526 --> 00:05:32.716
of a series of moments,

110
00:05:32.816 --> 00:05:35.796
which then in turn are
comprised of assets.

111
00:05:38.236 --> 00:05:41.416
Now let's walk through
these Model Objects in terms

112
00:05:41.416 --> 00:05:43.076
of the APIs that
are exposed to you

113
00:05:43.076 --> 00:05:44.146
through the Photos Framework.

114
00:05:44.776 --> 00:05:46.676
The first one we'll
look at is the Assets,

115
00:05:46.676 --> 00:05:47.686
the photos and videos.

116
00:05:48.226 --> 00:05:51.016
And photos and videos
assets are represented

117
00:05:51.016 --> 00:05:52.696
by the PHAsset class.

118
00:05:53.816 --> 00:05:57.236
And as you look through this
UI in the Photos Application,

119
00:05:57.236 --> 00:05:59.266
you can see it's a photo.

120
00:05:59.266 --> 00:06:00.266
That's the media type.

121
00:05:59.266 --> 00:06:00.266
That's the media type.

122
00:06:01.446 --> 00:06:02.286
But then at the top

123
00:06:02.286 --> 00:06:05.096
of the screen you can see we're
displaying the creation date

124
00:06:05.096 --> 00:06:08.116
and the location, which are
both properties of the asset.

125
00:06:09.106 --> 00:06:11.966
Down at the bottom of the screen
you can see an icon representing

126
00:06:12.256 --> 00:06:14.796
a heart, that is, whether

127
00:06:14.796 --> 00:06:16.766
that asset has been
marked as a favorite.

128
00:06:17.386 --> 00:06:19.436
And these are all
properties available to you

129
00:06:19.436 --> 00:06:21.296
in the model object, PHAsset.

130
00:06:21.726 --> 00:06:25.756
At the next level
up we're talking

131
00:06:25.756 --> 00:06:27.586
about the Asset Collection
and, again,

132
00:06:27.586 --> 00:06:29.466
we're illustrating
that with the moment.

133
00:06:29.846 --> 00:06:34.176
An Asset Collection is a general
ordered collection of assets,

134
00:06:34.326 --> 00:06:35.596
so there are a couple
of different types.

135
00:06:35.596 --> 00:06:37.706
We've got moments,
like you can see here.

136
00:06:37.706 --> 00:06:40.266
But we also have
albums and smart albums.

137
00:06:40.776 --> 00:06:44.246
The Asset Collection,
unsurprisingly,

138
00:06:44.546 --> 00:06:47.676
represented by the
PHAssetCollection class,

139
00:06:48.246 --> 00:06:50.916
and it has the properties
of the type, title,

140
00:06:51.516 --> 00:06:52.566
and start and end date.

141
00:06:52.566 --> 00:06:54.676
And you can see these
properties reflected in the UI.

142
00:06:56.816 --> 00:07:00.606
Going one level higher, we
have the Collection List.

143
00:06:56.816 --> 00:07:00.606
Going one level higher, we
have the Collection List.

144
00:07:01.316 --> 00:07:04.556
And a Collection List
is an ordered collection

145
00:07:04.556 --> 00:07:05.456
of collections.

146
00:07:05.796 --> 00:07:08.776
And in the case we're looking at
here, we've got a moment year.

147
00:07:09.316 --> 00:07:11.086
But you can also have
a Collection List

148
00:07:11.086 --> 00:07:12.556
that represents a folder.

149
00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:15.426
And something that's
unique about a folder

150
00:07:15.426 --> 00:07:19.026
versus a moment year type
of Collection List is

151
00:07:19.026 --> 00:07:21.796
that a folder can
actually contain subfolders

152
00:07:21.946 --> 00:07:23.276
as well as albums.

153
00:07:23.436 --> 00:07:27.486
So that's why we say an ordered
collection of collections

154
00:07:27.486 --> 00:07:30.316
where those collections
might be an Asset Collection

155
00:07:30.866 --> 00:07:32.716
or a Collection List.

156
00:07:33.316 --> 00:07:38.306
The Collection List class
is the PHCollectionList and,

157
00:07:38.306 --> 00:07:40.166
similar to the Asset
Collection, has a type,

158
00:07:40.716 --> 00:07:44.916
title and a start and end date.

159
00:07:46.086 --> 00:07:48.306
So when you want to work
with these model objects,

160
00:07:48.836 --> 00:07:50.726
you need to get them out
of the photo library.

161
00:07:51.296 --> 00:07:55.466
So, in order to get
these model objects

162
00:07:55.466 --> 00:07:58.576
out of the photo library, the
key concept here that I want you

163
00:07:58.656 --> 00:08:00.626
to focus on in this
section for fetching,

164
00:07:58.656 --> 00:08:00.626
to focus on in this
section for fetching,

165
00:08:00.626 --> 00:08:05.236
is that you use the class
methods on the model object

166
00:08:05.236 --> 00:08:06.256
that you want to fetch out.

167
00:08:06.846 --> 00:08:08.916
So when you want to
fetch out assets - say,

168
00:08:08.916 --> 00:08:10.766
you wanted to fetch all
of the video assets -

169
00:08:11.696 --> 00:08:14.536
you look for the class
method on the PHAsset class,

170
00:08:14.616 --> 00:08:20.486
fetchAssetsWithMediaType,
specifying the media type video.

171
00:08:20.656 --> 00:08:22.986
Similarly, as I said before,

172
00:08:22.986 --> 00:08:24.906
a moment is a type
of Asset Collection.

173
00:08:25.236 --> 00:08:28.446
So to fetch moments,
we use a class method

174
00:08:28.446 --> 00:08:32.576
on the Asset Collection class,
to fetchMomentsWithOptions.

175
00:08:33.476 --> 00:08:36.635
Now in both of these examples
I've omitted the options,

176
00:08:36.986 --> 00:08:39.856
but they give you an opportunity
to do things like filter

177
00:08:39.856 --> 00:08:42.446
or sort the results
that you get back.

178
00:08:44.606 --> 00:08:48.496
So the next key concept
I want to cover as far

179
00:08:48.496 --> 00:08:52.326
as collections are
concerned is that collections

180
00:08:52.426 --> 00:08:56.656
in the Photos Framework
runtime don't actually cache

181
00:08:56.656 --> 00:08:57.486
their contents.

182
00:08:57.486 --> 00:08:57.916
[ Cough ]

183
00:08:57.916 --> 00:08:59.526
Excuse me.

184
00:08:59.796 --> 00:09:03.016
So what that means is that
in order to find the assets

185
00:08:59.796 --> 00:09:03.016
So what that means is that
in order to find the assets

186
00:09:03.016 --> 00:09:06.266
that live in an album you need
to perform a fetch similar

187
00:09:06.266 --> 00:09:08.916
to the ones that we just saw
for general purpose fetching.

188
00:09:09.486 --> 00:09:10.886
So here's an illustration
of that.

189
00:09:11.246 --> 00:09:13.656
To fetch the assets in an
Asset Collection represented

190
00:09:13.656 --> 00:09:17.786
by an album, we're getting back
assets, so we use a class method

191
00:09:17.786 --> 00:09:19.586
on the PHAsset class

192
00:09:20.066 --> 00:09:22.776
and fetchAssetsInAsset
Collection:myAlbum.

193
00:09:23.356 --> 00:09:27.526
Now the next construct
that I want

194
00:09:27.526 --> 00:09:31.406
to cover here is something we
call a Transient Collection.

195
00:09:31.406 --> 00:09:36.376
And this is a really useful
construct that we've made a lot

196
00:09:36.376 --> 00:09:40.146
of use of in the photos
application where we wanted

197
00:09:40.146 --> 00:09:43.636
to represent a collection
that isn't represented

198
00:09:43.636 --> 00:09:45.146
in the actual photo library.

199
00:09:45.556 --> 00:09:49.316
An example of that is a search
result or a user selection

200
00:09:49.316 --> 00:09:51.266
as they're picking
off items in the UI.

201
00:09:52.196 --> 00:09:57.966
And by taking that selection
of items or model objects

202
00:09:57.966 --> 00:09:59.816
and putting it into a
Transient Collection,

203
00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:04.926
the benefit is the Transient
Collection is interchangeable

204
00:10:04.986 --> 00:10:07.146
with the regular collections
that you might fetch

205
00:10:07.146 --> 00:10:07.976
out of the photo library.

206
00:10:08.976 --> 00:10:12.376
So you can do things like reuse
your existing view controllers

207
00:10:12.436 --> 00:10:14.846
or fetch the contents of
a Transient Collection

208
00:10:15.116 --> 00:10:17.496
without worrying about whether
it's represented by something

209
00:10:17.496 --> 00:10:20.186
that really exists
on the photo library

210
00:10:20.436 --> 00:10:21.306
or if it's just something

211
00:10:21.306 --> 00:10:23.106
that your user is working
with in the runtime.

212
00:10:23.496 --> 00:10:27.726
To create a Transient Collection
there's a class method

213
00:10:27.726 --> 00:10:29.236
on the Asset Collection class

214
00:10:29.236 --> 00:10:30.896
to create a Transient
Asset Collection.

215
00:10:30.956 --> 00:10:33.066
You could also create a
Transient Collection list.

216
00:10:33.606 --> 00:10:35.576
But to create a Transient
Asset Collection we call

217
00:10:35.576 --> 00:10:38.806
transientAssetCollection
WithAssets and simply pass

218
00:10:38.806 --> 00:10:41.746
in an array of assets as
well as an optional title.

219
00:10:44.946 --> 00:10:48.526
So what are you getting back
when you perform these fetches?

220
00:10:48.946 --> 00:10:51.386
Most of the time when you're
writing an application to work

221
00:10:51.386 --> 00:10:53.846
with photos, you're going
to be reading those objects,

222
00:10:54.366 --> 00:10:56.076
looking through them,
working with them.

223
00:10:56.266 --> 00:10:58.266
So we wanted to make it
as simple as possible

224
00:10:58.266 --> 00:11:00.696
to get those objects out and
to work with them directly.

225
00:10:58.266 --> 00:11:00.696
to get those objects out and
to work with them directly.

226
00:11:01.016 --> 00:11:03.016
So you wanted to get
synchronous results

227
00:11:03.016 --> 00:11:04.086
and you want them quickly.

228
00:11:05.866 --> 00:11:09.056
But, especially when you think
about iCloud Photo Library,

229
00:11:09.176 --> 00:11:12.996
the results of the fetch could
be potentially very large,

230
00:11:13.256 --> 00:11:15.536
in the tens of thousands
of assets or even more.

231
00:11:16.516 --> 00:11:17.886
So it's really important

232
00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:20.316
that you don't fetch all those
objects into memory at once.

233
00:11:20.976 --> 00:11:23.466
And you really want to
work with them in batches

234
00:11:23.466 --> 00:11:25.956
as you're working with them
or displaying them on screen.

235
00:11:27.166 --> 00:11:29.166
But we didn't want to put
that complexity on you.

236
00:11:30.186 --> 00:11:33.486
So what we did is we've
introduced a class

237
00:11:33.486 --> 00:11:35.266
to represent the
objects that you get back

238
00:11:35.266 --> 00:11:37.466
from a fetch called
a PHFetchResult.

239
00:11:38.606 --> 00:11:43.296
And the PHFetchResult takes care
of tracking the full results set

240
00:11:43.586 --> 00:11:44.316
by keeping track

241
00:11:44.316 --> 00:11:46.856
of the lightweight
IDs representing each

242
00:11:46.856 --> 00:11:48.536
of the contents of that fetch.

243
00:11:48.986 --> 00:11:52.776
But when you access the contents
of that fetch result to pull one

244
00:11:52.776 --> 00:11:55.776
of the objects out, we'll vend
you a fully realized object

245
00:11:56.086 --> 00:11:56.896
that you can work with.

246
00:11:57.896 --> 00:12:00.906
It's got an API that's familiar
and similar to the NSArray

247
00:11:57.896 --> 00:12:00.906
It's got an API that's familiar
and similar to the NSArray

248
00:12:00.906 --> 00:12:03.406
so it should be easy
to work with.

249
00:12:03.806 --> 00:12:07.896
And I'd like to show you
an example of what it looks

250
00:12:07.896 --> 00:12:10.426
like as you're working
with a fetch result.

251
00:12:11.406 --> 00:12:16.146
So on the slide here I've
shown a fetch result that's

252
00:12:16.146 --> 00:12:18.416
representing, say, a
fetch of 10,000 assets

253
00:12:19.096 --> 00:12:21.706
and as we're iterating
through that result set,

254
00:12:21.706 --> 00:12:26.666
pulling out assets, as we
access one of the indexes,

255
00:12:27.076 --> 00:12:29.916
we'll behind the scenes pull
in a full batch to represent

256
00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:32.026
that object as well
as many of the others.

257
00:12:32.816 --> 00:12:36.696
And as you iterate through over
that batch to the next batch,

258
00:12:36.876 --> 00:12:38.976
we'll pull in the
next batch of objects

259
00:12:39.246 --> 00:12:42.346
but release the previous ones
so you don't wind up holding

260
00:12:42.346 --> 00:12:43.266
onto all that in memory.

261
00:12:45.326 --> 00:12:48.806
So now that you've got the
[applause] - ah, thanks.

262
00:12:51.076 --> 00:12:53.656
Now that you've got model
objects that you're working

263
00:12:53.656 --> 00:12:58.736
with in your application, your
user may, will, oftentimes want

264
00:12:58.736 --> 00:13:00.206
to make changes to
those objects.

265
00:12:58.736 --> 00:13:00.206
to make changes to
those objects.

266
00:13:00.706 --> 00:13:03.786
So I want to take a look at
how you can make model changes

267
00:13:04.426 --> 00:13:07.176
with those model
objects to support things

268
00:13:07.176 --> 00:13:11.516
like the user wanting to
favorite a photo or add a photo

269
00:13:11.516 --> 00:13:15.056
to an album because,
as I said earlier,

270
00:13:15.376 --> 00:13:17.156
the model objects
themselves are read-only

271
00:13:17.156 --> 00:13:18.666
so you can't mutate
them directly.

272
00:13:20.416 --> 00:13:22.786
So the way we express changes is

273
00:13:22.786 --> 00:13:25.346
through a Change
Request API that's based

274
00:13:25.346 --> 00:13:30.056
on change request
classes that you create

275
00:13:30.056 --> 00:13:33.376
in a change request block and
then hand to the photo library

276
00:13:34.056 --> 00:13:36.736
so that it can apply those
changes asynchronously

277
00:13:36.896 --> 00:13:37.856
out of process.

278
00:13:38.666 --> 00:13:41.196
And the reasons those changes
are applied out of process

279
00:13:41.356 --> 00:13:43.286
and asynchronously is twofold.

280
00:13:44.096 --> 00:13:47.556
The first reason is,
for some operations,

281
00:13:47.736 --> 00:13:51.516
it may be very expensive
or processor-intensive

282
00:13:51.516 --> 00:13:52.736
or just take a long time.

283
00:13:53.346 --> 00:13:56.296
But even more importantly than
that, because you're working

284
00:13:56.296 --> 00:13:58.346
with the user's actual
photo library,

285
00:13:58.756 --> 00:14:02.406
some of those actions may
require user authentication.

286
00:13:58.756 --> 00:14:02.406
some of those actions may
require user authentication.

287
00:14:02.736 --> 00:14:05.066
For example, if you
wanted to delete 10 photos,

288
00:14:06.276 --> 00:14:08.626
the photo library's going
to prompt the user to say,

289
00:14:09.086 --> 00:14:13.406
"Is this application allowed
to delete these 10 photos?"

290
00:14:13.666 --> 00:14:17.636
to allow the user to have
a chance to confirm that.

291
00:14:19.406 --> 00:14:21.426
So let's take a look at
the change request classes.

292
00:14:21.426 --> 00:14:22.796
It's actually pretty simple.

293
00:14:22.796 --> 00:14:26.416
For each model object class,
there is a change request class.

294
00:14:26.416 --> 00:14:28.036
We've got the
AssetChangeRequest,

295
00:14:28.036 --> 00:14:29.466
the
AssetCollectionChangeRequest,

296
00:14:29.816 --> 00:14:32.016
and the
CollectionListChangeRequest.

297
00:14:32.666 --> 00:14:35.796
And each of these change
request classes provide model

298
00:14:35.796 --> 00:14:38.966
object-specific APIs to allow
you to perform the types

299
00:14:38.966 --> 00:14:40.116
of changes that they allow.

300
00:14:41.256 --> 00:14:45.716
So the example I'm showing here
is for the asset change request

301
00:14:45.716 --> 00:14:48.126
where you can set the
creation date for an asset

302
00:14:48.436 --> 00:14:49.646
or to set it as a favorite.

303
00:14:53.666 --> 00:14:55.936
Some other things to understand

304
00:14:55.936 --> 00:14:57.356
about the change
request classes is

305
00:14:57.356 --> 00:15:00.556
that they are not subclasses
of the model classes.

306
00:14:57.356 --> 00:15:00.556
that they are not subclasses
of the model classes.

307
00:15:00.556 --> 00:15:02.396
And there's a good
reason for that.

308
00:15:02.626 --> 00:15:05.016
We wanted to provide a
really clear separation

309
00:15:05.016 --> 00:15:08.436
between the thread-safe,
immutable model objects

310
00:15:08.566 --> 00:15:10.496
and the objects that
express mutations.

311
00:15:10.796 --> 00:15:12.266
That's the change
request classes.

312
00:15:13.056 --> 00:15:15.726
These change request classes
are also only valid to work

313
00:15:15.726 --> 00:15:17.616
within a change request block.

314
00:15:18.086 --> 00:15:22.546
So I'd like to illustrate
that with an example now.

315
00:15:23.086 --> 00:15:29.436
So here's an example where I've
provided a sample implementation

316
00:15:29.436 --> 00:15:33.856
of a method to toggle whether
an asset has been marked

317
00:15:33.856 --> 00:15:34.436
as a favorite.

318
00:15:35.586 --> 00:15:37.226
So the first thing we'll do

319
00:15:37.226 --> 00:15:41.526
in this method is ask
the shared photo library

320
00:15:41.526 --> 00:15:43.776
to perform some changes,
and we'll pass

321
00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:45.276
in a change request block here.

322
00:15:47.776 --> 00:15:51.336
First step in that block is
to create a change request

323
00:15:51.336 --> 00:15:53.516
for the asset that we were
provided in the method.

324
00:15:54.246 --> 00:15:57.026
And we're using the
PHAssetChangeRequest class here

325
00:15:57.026 --> 00:15:57.556
you can see.

326
00:15:58.126 --> 00:16:03.236
And then the last
step is simply to set

327
00:15:58.126 --> 00:16:03.236
And then the last
step is simply to set

328
00:16:03.846 --> 00:16:08.466
on the change request the value
of Favorite to the inverse value

329
00:16:08.466 --> 00:16:11.036
of what the asset currently has.

330
00:16:12.346 --> 00:16:16.446
That's enough for the block to
get passed to the photo library

331
00:16:16.836 --> 00:16:19.366
and those changes to be
performed on your behalf.

332
00:16:20.936 --> 00:16:23.626
After those changes are
performed we'll call back the

333
00:16:23.626 --> 00:16:28.206
completion handler and let
you know if it was successful

334
00:16:28.546 --> 00:16:29.756
in performing those changes.

335
00:16:33.416 --> 00:16:36.296
So one other aspect of
working with change requests

336
00:16:36.296 --> 00:16:40.276
that you'll want to do is
to create new model objects.

337
00:16:40.726 --> 00:16:42.526
And you can create
new model objects

338
00:16:42.606 --> 00:16:44.466
with these same change
request classes

339
00:16:44.696 --> 00:16:45.866
but creating a different kind

340
00:16:45.866 --> 00:16:49.056
of change request using
a creation request.

341
00:16:49.196 --> 00:16:50.886
So in this case I've
shown as an example

342
00:16:50.886 --> 00:16:53.106
where you can create a new asset

343
00:16:53.106 --> 00:16:56.966
from an image using the
creationRequestForAssetFromImage

344
00:16:57.256 --> 00:16:57.946
class method.

345
00:16:59.246 --> 00:17:02.316
And if all you want to
do is create a new asset

346
00:16:59.246 --> 00:17:02.316
And if all you want to
do is create a new asset

347
00:17:02.316 --> 00:17:04.955
from an image, you're done.

348
00:17:04.955 --> 00:17:08.156
You just make this call
within a change request block

349
00:17:08.156 --> 00:17:10.406
and the library will take
care of adding the asset.

350
00:17:11.506 --> 00:17:13.996
But if you want to
work with that asset

351
00:17:14.165 --> 00:17:17.896
within that change request block
to do some additional work, say,

352
00:17:17.896 --> 00:17:21.455
to add it to an album, well,

353
00:17:21.455 --> 00:17:24.566
remember that the asset
won't actually be created

354
00:17:24.566 --> 00:17:26.665
until the work is
performed out of process.

355
00:17:27.306 --> 00:17:32.566
So within the same change
request block you can access a

356
00:17:32.566 --> 00:17:35.736
placeholder object from the
change request representing

357
00:17:35.736 --> 00:17:37.286
that new unsaved object.

358
00:17:37.616 --> 00:17:40.986
And then you can use that
placeholder to add the new asset

359
00:17:40.986 --> 00:17:45.396
to a collection or even
potentially a new placeholder

360
00:17:45.396 --> 00:17:46.166
for a collection.

361
00:17:48.076 --> 00:17:49.306
One other thing you can get

362
00:17:49.306 --> 00:17:52.836
from a placeholder object is you
can access the localIdentifier

363
00:17:52.836 --> 00:17:55.886
which is a unique string
that you can use later

364
00:17:55.886 --> 00:17:58.766
in your application to
fetch that object back even

365
00:17:58.766 --> 00:17:59.886
on another invocation.

366
00:18:01.736 --> 00:18:04.096
So what happens to
these changes?

367
00:18:05.766 --> 00:18:07.446
Well, the changes are done

368
00:18:07.446 --> 00:18:09.106
when the completion
handler is invoked.

369
00:18:10.016 --> 00:18:12.466
But the model objects
are read-only

370
00:18:12.466 --> 00:18:14.806
and they aren't automatically
refreshed or modified

371
00:18:14.806 --> 00:18:15.776
out from underneath you.

372
00:18:16.636 --> 00:18:19.336
But more important than these
two things when we're talking

373
00:18:19.336 --> 00:18:22.466
about changes, there's a really
important thing to understand.

374
00:18:23.536 --> 00:18:26.906
The changes that you requested
may incur side effects

375
00:18:27.636 --> 00:18:31.406
or may be influenced by
external changes coming

376
00:18:31.406 --> 00:18:32.126
in from elsewhere.

377
00:18:33.106 --> 00:18:35.766
In fact, there are a lot
of sources for change

378
00:18:35.766 --> 00:18:36.946
into the photo library.

379
00:18:37.216 --> 00:18:38.526
There's your application.

380
00:18:38.626 --> 00:18:40.066
There's the built-in
application.

381
00:18:40.376 --> 00:18:41.766
There's iCloud Photo Library,

382
00:18:42.036 --> 00:18:44.416
Cloud Photo Sharing
and my Photo Stream.

383
00:18:44.926 --> 00:18:47.366
And all of these things can
have an impact on the data

384
00:18:47.366 --> 00:18:48.176
that you're working with.

385
00:18:48.926 --> 00:18:51.816
So what we recommend is
that, instead of trying

386
00:18:51.816 --> 00:18:54.676
to take the result of a change
in your completion handler,

387
00:18:55.316 --> 00:18:58.406
you work with a single
change notification system

388
00:18:58.656 --> 00:19:00.566
to handle changes
there and reflect them

389
00:18:58.656 --> 00:19:00.566
to handle changes
there and reflect them

390
00:19:00.566 --> 00:19:03.606
to your user that way.

391
00:19:03.796 --> 00:19:06.556
So what happens is,
anytime there is a change

392
00:19:06.556 --> 00:19:09.646
to the photo library,
we'll publish a PHChange

393
00:19:09.686 --> 00:19:11.556
to registered observers.

394
00:19:12.616 --> 00:19:14.866
And that change is delivered
on a background queue

395
00:19:15.296 --> 00:19:18.596
and it provides details on
updated and deleted objects.

396
00:19:19.236 --> 00:19:22.276
But where it begins to
get really powerful is

397
00:19:22.276 --> 00:19:23.866
when you're working
with fetch results,

398
00:19:24.716 --> 00:19:27.566
where it can provide you
details on what indexes

399
00:19:27.566 --> 00:19:30.426
and objects were inserted,
updated, deleted or moved

400
00:19:30.726 --> 00:19:32.216
that apply to that fetch result.

401
00:19:33.516 --> 00:19:34.766
And I want to dig
a little deeper

402
00:19:34.766 --> 00:19:36.976
into the fetch result
change details.

403
00:19:38.026 --> 00:19:40.476
When you create a fetch
result by performing a fetch

404
00:19:40.476 --> 00:19:42.726
for a collection or any
other general-purpose fetch,

405
00:19:43.396 --> 00:19:45.906
the fetch result will
implicitly register itself

406
00:19:46.146 --> 00:19:48.936
with the photo library
for calculating changes.

407
00:19:49.816 --> 00:19:53.576
And all those changed details
are calculated in the background

408
00:19:53.816 --> 00:19:57.066
so they don't run while
your user is interacting

409
00:19:57.066 --> 00:19:57.926
with your application.

410
00:19:59.816 --> 00:20:03.456
If you're fetching a fetch
result and you're not interested

411
00:19:59.816 --> 00:20:03.456
If you're fetching a fetch
result and you're not interested

412
00:20:03.516 --> 00:20:05.486
in change details, you can opt

413
00:20:05.486 --> 00:20:08.796
out of the difference
calculation via one

414
00:20:08.796 --> 00:20:09.726
of those fetch options.

415
00:20:10.266 --> 00:20:13.296
But if you do want the details,

416
00:20:13.296 --> 00:20:18.046
if you want those incremental
differences, then it's important

417
00:20:18.046 --> 00:20:21.636
that you get the updated fetch
result for the fetch result

418
00:20:21.636 --> 00:20:26.746
that you started with from
the PHFetchResultChangeDetails

419
00:20:26.746 --> 00:20:27.336
object.

420
00:20:27.956 --> 00:20:29.626
And I'm going to walk
you through an example

421
00:20:29.626 --> 00:20:31.816
to demonstrate why
that's so important.

422
00:20:32.186 --> 00:20:36.166
When the photo library
receives a change,

423
00:20:36.726 --> 00:20:39.016
if you've registered
yourself as an observer,

424
00:20:39.316 --> 00:20:41.396
we'll call the
PhotoLibraryDidChange method

425
00:20:41.396 --> 00:20:43.376
and pass you the
PHChange instance.

426
00:20:43.916 --> 00:20:48.326
In this case, in this
example, which by the way,

427
00:20:48.326 --> 00:20:50.896
this example is taken from the
sample code that's provided

428
00:20:50.896 --> 00:20:53.996
with this session, so I've
omitted some of the details

429
00:20:53.996 --> 00:20:55.796
to make it a little
clearer on stage,

430
00:20:56.236 --> 00:20:58.666
but all of this is
available in the sample code

431
00:20:58.666 --> 00:21:02.336
that you can download
from the WWDC website.

432
00:20:58.666 --> 00:21:02.336
that you can download
from the WWDC website.

433
00:21:03.476 --> 00:21:05.646
Anyway, getting back to that.

434
00:21:06.436 --> 00:21:08.086
The first thing we're
going to want to do

435
00:21:08.086 --> 00:21:12.816
in our change handler here is
to dispatch to the main queue.

436
00:21:12.816 --> 00:21:14.966
And the reason for that is
because we're going to work

437
00:21:14.966 --> 00:21:17.796
with our user interface
objects, our view controllers,

438
00:21:18.086 --> 00:21:20.976
and you know it's only safe to
access those on the main queue.

439
00:21:22.556 --> 00:21:24.576
So once we've dispatched

440
00:21:24.576 --> 00:21:27.316
to the main queue we'll
ask the change instance,

441
00:21:28.276 --> 00:21:30.826
"Were there any changed
details for the fetch result

442
00:21:30.826 --> 00:21:32.886
that we are working with
in our view controller?"

443
00:21:32.886 --> 00:21:36.496
And in this case, we've got -
I've represented self.assets.

444
00:21:36.496 --> 00:21:41.646
That's a fetch result that we're
presenting in a collection view.

445
00:21:42.726 --> 00:21:46.056
So if there's a change that
affects the collection view,

446
00:21:46.056 --> 00:21:47.336
the contents of that
collection view,

447
00:21:47.446 --> 00:21:48.876
we want to know what
those details are.

448
00:21:48.876 --> 00:21:51.226
So we'll ask the change instance
for those change details.

449
00:21:51.746 --> 00:21:55.666
And if there were any change
details then we know we need

450
00:21:55.666 --> 00:22:00.196
to update our fetch result based
on what those changes were.

451
00:21:55.666 --> 00:22:00.196
to update our fetch result based
on what those changes were.

452
00:22:00.536 --> 00:22:02.346
And the way to get
those details,

453
00:22:02.346 --> 00:22:04.656
or to get that updated fetch
result as I was saying,

454
00:22:04.916 --> 00:22:07.806
is to get it directly from
the change details object.

455
00:22:08.666 --> 00:22:10.826
The change details have
already done that work for us,

456
00:22:11.016 --> 00:22:13.856
and that way we're sure that the
other details we're going to ask

457
00:22:13.856 --> 00:22:16.096
for about inserts, updates
and deletes are going

458
00:22:16.096 --> 00:22:19.166
to exactly match up to the new
result that we're working with.

459
00:22:20.376 --> 00:22:21.966
So on the second slide here,

460
00:22:22.476 --> 00:22:26.056
I'm going to show you how
nicely this works with an object

461
00:22:26.056 --> 00:22:26.996
like the collectionView.

462
00:22:27.786 --> 00:22:29.446
So now we can tell
the collectionView

463
00:22:29.946 --> 00:22:32.716
to perform a batch
of updates and walk

464
00:22:32.716 --> 00:22:36.376
through the changed details to
see where there removed indexes?

465
00:22:36.596 --> 00:22:39.016
If there were, we'll
translate them into index paths

466
00:22:39.016 --> 00:22:41.256
that the collectionView
can understand and tell it

467
00:22:41.256 --> 00:22:44.796
to delete the items
at those paths.

468
00:22:44.966 --> 00:22:46.986
Similarly, we'll ask
the change details,

469
00:22:46.986 --> 00:22:49.186
were there inserted indexes
in that fetch result?

470
00:22:49.806 --> 00:22:51.936
If there were, we'll tell
the collectionView again

471
00:22:52.296 --> 00:22:55.546
to insert items at those paths.

472
00:22:55.546 --> 00:22:59.146
And same with changed indexes
that affect the fetch results.

473
00:22:59.486 --> 00:23:01.876
We'll ask the collectionVew
to reload those items.

474
00:22:59.486 --> 00:23:01.876
We'll ask the collectionVew
to reload those items.

475
00:23:03.106 --> 00:23:06.796
So now I'd like to take a moment
to show you a demonstration

476
00:23:06.796 --> 00:23:10.706
of the sample code that we've
provided with this session.

477
00:23:11.476 --> 00:23:12.536
So the first thing I'm going

478
00:23:12.536 --> 00:23:16.876
to do before I actually run the
sample app is just give you a

479
00:23:16.876 --> 00:23:19.326
view of the photo library
that we're working with here.

480
00:23:20.576 --> 00:23:23.676
And so I'm running the
iOS 8 built-in Photos app.

481
00:23:24.906 --> 00:23:28.496
And you can see I've got
a series of Smart Albums

482
00:23:28.496 --> 00:23:33.046
in this album list here and, in
particular, I've got nine photos

483
00:23:33.046 --> 00:23:34.106
in my Favorites Library.

484
00:23:34.636 --> 00:23:38.486
Now I'm going to switch over
to the sample application

485
00:23:40.916 --> 00:23:45.636
and we've got a listing here
with a special entry on top,

486
00:23:45.886 --> 00:23:47.526
all the photos in
the Photo Library.

487
00:23:47.526 --> 00:23:48.556
We can take a quick look.

488
00:23:48.556 --> 00:23:51.136
You can see we've got a pretty
good-sized library here.

489
00:23:51.826 --> 00:23:53.666
But we have also got
those Smart Albums.

490
00:23:54.186 --> 00:23:58.506
So I'm going to tap
on the Favorites Album

491
00:23:59.676 --> 00:24:01.646
and you can see it's
the same contents.

492
00:23:59.676 --> 00:24:01.646
and you can see it's
the same contents.

493
00:24:02.746 --> 00:24:05.016
But it's pretty obvious
that one of the photos

494
00:24:05.016 --> 00:24:06.286
in this group doesn't belong.

495
00:24:06.916 --> 00:24:11.236
So I'm going to tap on my moose
and you can see when you look

496
00:24:11.236 --> 00:24:14.556
at the sample code, we're going
to use - I'll bring up the menu

497
00:24:14.556 --> 00:24:16.656
with this Edit button.

498
00:24:16.896 --> 00:24:19.766
When I press Unfavorite,
the code is going

499
00:24:19.766 --> 00:24:22.556
to create a change
request to set that asset

500
00:24:22.966 --> 00:24:24.506
as not being a Favorite anymore.

501
00:24:25.986 --> 00:24:30.966
Okay? When I back out to the
Favorites smart album you'll

502
00:24:30.966 --> 00:24:32.206
notice the moose is gone.

503
00:24:32.896 --> 00:24:35.816
Nothing in the code actually
asked to remove that moose

504
00:24:35.816 --> 00:24:36.816
from that Smart Album.

505
00:24:37.056 --> 00:24:38.876
This is one of those side
effects I was talking

506
00:24:38.876 --> 00:24:39.956
about where a change

507
00:24:39.956 --> 00:24:42.676
that I requested has
triggered a secondary change

508
00:24:42.936 --> 00:24:45.436
that was reflected in
the user interface.

509
00:24:45.946 --> 00:24:51.686
Now if we switch back to the
built-in photos application,

510
00:24:52.056 --> 00:24:55.096
you can see that change is
immediately reflected there

511
00:24:55.096 --> 00:24:55.546
as well.

512
00:24:55.976 --> 00:24:58.996
The photo's been taken out of
that Favorites Smart Album, too.

513
00:25:00.046 --> 00:25:02.156
Now there's one other
thing I want to quickly go

514
00:25:02.156 --> 00:25:06.556
through to show you in
terms of the sample code,

515
00:25:06.896 --> 00:25:11.496
and that is if I go into the
photo list and I find a photo

516
00:25:11.496 --> 00:25:15.256
that I think the user wants to
delete, where I as the user want

517
00:25:15.256 --> 00:25:18.666
to delete, I'm going to
go ahead and create a -

518
00:25:18.666 --> 00:25:19.886
if you look at the sample code -

519
00:25:19.886 --> 00:25:22.086
you'll see I create a
Delete change request.

520
00:25:22.566 --> 00:25:25.946
But there's no code
in the application

521
00:25:25.946 --> 00:25:27.006
to provide this prompt.

522
00:25:27.276 --> 00:25:30.716
This is the photo library
performing some work

523
00:25:30.716 --> 00:25:32.626
out-of-process to
let the user know

524
00:25:32.626 --> 00:25:35.916
that an application has
requested a change that's

525
00:25:35.916 --> 00:25:38.916
destructive to their library
and asking for confirmation.

526
00:25:39.166 --> 00:25:42.516
So you can see, "Allow Sample
Photos App to delete 1 photo?"

527
00:25:42.516 --> 00:25:45.146
And in this case I'm
not going to delete it.

528
00:25:45.456 --> 00:25:48.696
But you can see how some of
the work that is performed

529
00:25:48.696 --> 00:25:51.076
out of process can have such
an impact on your changes.

530
00:25:53.686 --> 00:25:54.126
All right.

531
00:25:54.456 --> 00:25:58.936
Well, that covers the work with
model objects that I wanted

532
00:25:58.936 --> 00:26:01.036
to introduce from
the Photos Framework.

533
00:25:58.936 --> 00:26:01.036
to introduce from
the Photos Framework.

534
00:26:01.996 --> 00:26:03.296
But there's a lot more
that you could see

535
00:26:03.296 --> 00:26:06.216
in the sample application when
you look at all the images

536
00:26:06.216 --> 00:26:07.826
and image data that
was presented.

537
00:26:08.256 --> 00:26:11.046
So I'd like to invite Karl
up to talk about image

538
00:26:11.046 --> 00:26:11.926
and video data, thanks.

539
00:26:12.516 --> 00:26:17.596
[ Applause ]

540
00:26:18.096 --> 00:26:19.136
>> So, good morning.

541
00:26:19.136 --> 00:26:20.056
My name is Karl Hsu.

542
00:26:20.056 --> 00:26:21.906
I also work on the
iOS Photos Frameworks.

543
00:26:23.006 --> 00:26:25.816
So we've just spent a
little while talking

544
00:26:25.816 --> 00:26:28.816
about how you can discover
and work with the structure

545
00:26:28.896 --> 00:26:30.196
of the user's photo library.

546
00:26:30.196 --> 00:26:30.926
And that's great.

547
00:26:31.236 --> 00:26:33.266
But we're missing
a key ingredient

548
00:26:33.566 --> 00:26:35.406
because it is the
user's photo library.

549
00:26:35.946 --> 00:26:37.446
How do we actually get a hold of

550
00:26:37.446 --> 00:26:39.906
and display image
and video data?

551
00:26:41.456 --> 00:26:44.406
Before we begin,
it's useful to know

552
00:26:44.746 --> 00:26:49.736
that the user's photo library
actually caches a variety

553
00:26:49.736 --> 00:26:51.636
of representations
for each asset.

554
00:26:51.866 --> 00:26:54.916
For images, we might
have representations

555
00:26:54.916 --> 00:26:58.476
that vary all the way from the
full size original all the way

556
00:26:58.476 --> 00:26:59.816
down to small thumbnails.

557
00:27:00.526 --> 00:27:04.456
Videos might be cached in a
variety of bitrates and sizes.

558
00:27:04.716 --> 00:27:06.836
They might even be
streaming, okay?

559
00:27:07.486 --> 00:27:11.256
With iCloud Photo Library we
might not actually have all

560
00:27:11.286 --> 00:27:13.896
of those representations
cached on disks.

561
00:27:13.896 --> 00:27:15.906
Some or all of them,
or in some cases,

562
00:27:15.906 --> 00:27:17.376
even none of them
might be available.

563
00:27:18.246 --> 00:27:20.206
That makes it kind of
a pain when you want

564
00:27:20.206 --> 00:27:21.206
to display image data.

565
00:27:21.876 --> 00:27:24.346
So what we have is
we provide you

566
00:27:24.906 --> 00:27:26.806
with a class, the
PHImageManager.

567
00:27:27.306 --> 00:27:31.956
The PHImageManager's job is to
abstract a way, sort of this,

568
00:27:31.956 --> 00:27:34.016
your decision, from
having to decide, you know,

569
00:27:34.016 --> 00:27:36.886
do I want a thumbnail, do I
want a medium size, a large?

570
00:27:36.986 --> 00:27:37.576
What do you want?

571
00:27:37.856 --> 00:27:40.246
So basically it's
a usage-based API.

572
00:27:40.756 --> 00:27:43.606
For images, you tell us how
big do you want the image?

573
00:27:43.606 --> 00:27:44.886
What are you trying
to do with it?

574
00:27:44.886 --> 00:27:47.016
Are you trying to display it
in a small grid on the screen?

575
00:27:47.016 --> 00:27:48.916
Are you trying to -
you want the full size?

576
00:27:48.916 --> 00:27:50.236
You want something
that's screen size?

577
00:27:50.236 --> 00:27:51.866
And we'll try to find the right,

578
00:27:51.866 --> 00:27:54.146
the best available
representation we have for you.

579
00:27:54.666 --> 00:27:55.776
Similarly, videos.

580
00:27:56.006 --> 00:27:57.426
You tell us what
quality you'd like

581
00:27:57.426 --> 00:27:58.736
and what you plan
on doing with it.

582
00:27:58.736 --> 00:28:00.106
Is it just for user playback?

583
00:27:58.736 --> 00:28:00.106
Is it just for user playback?

584
00:28:00.106 --> 00:28:01.466
Are you planning
on exporting it?

585
00:28:01.466 --> 00:28:03.076
Or are you going to work
with it in some other way?

586
00:28:03.666 --> 00:28:05.946
And we'll try to pick
the right representation.

587
00:28:07.506 --> 00:28:12.416
One key thing here is that
unlike the model object API,

588
00:28:12.916 --> 00:28:14.486
which is largely synchronous,

589
00:28:15.336 --> 00:28:19.486
the image request APIs
are largely asynchronous.

590
00:28:20.176 --> 00:28:23.356
And that's because even if
the data is available locally,

591
00:28:23.356 --> 00:28:26.596
we may have to do work before
we can hand you the data.

592
00:28:26.596 --> 00:28:28.146
JPEGs have to be
read off a disk.

593
00:28:28.146 --> 00:28:29.136
They have to be decoded.

594
00:28:29.726 --> 00:28:33.716
But the most important case
is in the case of something

595
00:28:33.716 --> 00:28:34.996
like iCloud Photo Library,

596
00:28:35.256 --> 00:28:38.636
we may not have the data
locally available at all, right?

597
00:28:38.636 --> 00:28:40.346
We may have to go
out to the network,

598
00:28:40.676 --> 00:28:44.036
get it and then bring
it back to you.

599
00:28:44.266 --> 00:28:46.676
So let's take a quick look
at what that looks like.

600
00:28:46.926 --> 00:28:49.856
This is a very straightforward
fetch request.

601
00:28:49.996 --> 00:28:51.516
I'm sorry, image request.

602
00:28:52.636 --> 00:28:55.336
In this case we're
trying to fill sort

603
00:28:55.336 --> 00:28:58.166
of a straightforward
four-across grid on an iPhone.

604
00:28:58.536 --> 00:29:01.106
It turns out to be
about 160 by 160 pixels.

605
00:28:58.536 --> 00:29:01.106
It turns out to be
about 160 by 160 pixels.

606
00:29:01.696 --> 00:29:03.556
So we set the target size,

607
00:29:03.556 --> 00:29:06.336
we tell it that the image
should fill that target size,

608
00:29:06.336 --> 00:29:07.876
and then we issue the request.

609
00:29:07.876 --> 00:29:08.716
And when it comes back,

610
00:29:09.266 --> 00:29:11.706
if there's any image data
available, we'll hand it to you.

611
00:29:11.706 --> 00:29:14.916
The Info Dictionary is there and
we'll tell you a little bit more

612
00:29:14.916 --> 00:29:16.146
about what we handed you back.

613
00:29:16.146 --> 00:29:17.826
Specifically, is
it a substandard?

614
00:29:17.826 --> 00:29:19.096
Is it the right size?

615
00:29:19.656 --> 00:29:19.966
It's good.

616
00:29:21.316 --> 00:29:23.016
So let's take a look
at a little bit more

617
00:29:23.016 --> 00:29:24.356
of an advanced image request.

618
00:29:25.486 --> 00:29:29.086
So when you want to make
a more advanced request,

619
00:29:29.086 --> 00:29:30.986
you create an
ImageRequestOption.

620
00:29:31.876 --> 00:29:34.516
In this case, after
I create the option,

621
00:29:35.096 --> 00:29:37.356
I really want this photo, right?

622
00:29:38.046 --> 00:29:40.136
So I'm going to tell the
option that, yes, it's allowed

623
00:29:40.136 --> 00:29:41.236
to go out to the network.

624
00:29:41.236 --> 00:29:43.906
It can go out to iCloud
and fetch the data down.

625
00:29:44.156 --> 00:29:45.786
And because that might
take a little bit of time,

626
00:29:45.786 --> 00:29:47.306
I'd like a progress
handler as well.

627
00:29:47.786 --> 00:29:48.936
Again, this is a good idea.

628
00:29:48.936 --> 00:29:50.526
You can always show
the user that we're,

629
00:29:50.526 --> 00:29:52.336
in fact, doing work, okay?

630
00:29:52.336 --> 00:29:56.036
And then, finally, just
set it as an option

631
00:29:56.036 --> 00:29:57.486
when you actually
make the request.

632
00:30:00.396 --> 00:30:05.146
I want to spend a second
and talk about the callback

633
00:30:05.676 --> 00:30:07.316
that actually produces the data.

634
00:30:07.696 --> 00:30:09.176
There's two things
to keep in mind.

635
00:30:09.176 --> 00:30:14.016
Again, this block will be
called back on the main thread.

636
00:30:14.546 --> 00:30:17.296
And the reason is
because the feeling is

637
00:30:17.296 --> 00:30:18.916
that generally you
want to use it for -

638
00:30:18.916 --> 00:30:19.996
if it's an asynchronous
callback,

639
00:30:19.996 --> 00:30:22.046
you're typically using it for
display on the main thread.

640
00:30:22.726 --> 00:30:24.856
There's an optional way to
make a synchronous request

641
00:30:24.856 --> 00:30:26.286
if you're working in
background threads.

642
00:30:26.736 --> 00:30:28.656
Okay. The other thing
is actually,

643
00:30:29.306 --> 00:30:32.516
this block can be called
multiple times for each request

644
00:30:32.926 --> 00:30:37.906
because it turns out that a
really common UIDesign is the

645
00:30:37.906 --> 00:30:40.926
user wants to see their image
data as soon as possible.

646
00:30:41.546 --> 00:30:44.726
So if we have any image
data available we'll return

647
00:30:44.726 --> 00:30:46.586
that to you right away.

648
00:30:47.836 --> 00:30:50.346
And then, if that
isn't sufficient

649
00:30:50.466 --> 00:30:53.116
to fulfill your request,
we go out,

650
00:30:53.526 --> 00:30:56.606
possibly to the disk,
possibly to iCloud.

651
00:30:56.836 --> 00:30:58.796
We'll go get the data
and, when it arrives,

652
00:30:58.856 --> 00:31:00.966
then we'll call it
a second time.

653
00:30:58.856 --> 00:31:00.966
then we'll call it
a second time.

654
00:31:01.356 --> 00:31:03.356
[ Applause ]

655
00:31:03.696 --> 00:31:04.076
Thank you.

656
00:31:04.996 --> 00:31:06.806
Of course, if the
data's already available,

657
00:31:07.086 --> 00:31:08.886
then you only get
the first callout.

658
00:31:09.396 --> 00:31:12.606
Let's take a quick look
at requesting videos.

659
00:31:12.606 --> 00:31:15.616
So in this case, the user
has scrolled to some video

660
00:31:15.616 --> 00:31:17.056
and they just want playback.

661
00:31:17.216 --> 00:31:19.946
So we're requesting a
PlayerItem for the video.

662
00:31:20.006 --> 00:31:22.366
When we get back a player item
you can create an AVPlayer

663
00:31:22.366 --> 00:31:23.376
out of it.

664
00:31:23.376 --> 00:31:24.776
It looks very much
like the Image Request.

665
00:31:24.776 --> 00:31:25.706
It's pretty straightforward.

666
00:31:26.656 --> 00:31:31.196
And, again, if we want a more
advanced request - let's say,

667
00:31:31.586 --> 00:31:35.416
the user now wants
to push this video

668
00:31:35.446 --> 00:31:37.846
up to their own sharing service,
a different sharing service.

669
00:31:38.166 --> 00:31:40.586
So now we're going to
create a VideoRequestOption.

670
00:31:41.046 --> 00:31:44.736
And, of course, because
we're sharing it,

671
00:31:44.846 --> 00:31:47.806
we want it to be high quality.

672
00:31:47.806 --> 00:31:51.896
Maybe you're on an iPhone and
you wanted the full 1080p, okay?

673
00:31:52.516 --> 00:31:53.916
So, we want it to
be high quality

674
00:31:53.976 --> 00:31:55.386
and if it's not available -

675
00:31:56.036 --> 00:31:57.266
because we were playing
it before.

676
00:31:57.266 --> 00:31:58.346
That might have been streaming.

677
00:31:58.876 --> 00:32:00.626
We are, you know, we say,
okay, it's all right.

678
00:31:58.876 --> 00:32:00.626
We are, you know, we say,
okay, it's all right.

679
00:32:00.626 --> 00:32:02.286
You can go out to the
network and download it.

680
00:32:02.576 --> 00:32:04.866
And it's particularly
important for videos, of course,

681
00:32:04.866 --> 00:32:08.106
to have progress because
videos can be very large.

682
00:32:08.696 --> 00:32:11.026
And then, finally,
we set the option.

683
00:32:11.326 --> 00:32:13.636
Note here that we're actually
using a slightly different API.

684
00:32:13.636 --> 00:32:18.486
We're specifically requesting
an export session rather

685
00:32:18.486 --> 00:32:19.966
than a playback item.

686
00:32:20.496 --> 00:32:22.356
So this is good.

687
00:32:23.596 --> 00:32:26.286
We can fetch individual images,
and that works pretty well.

688
00:32:26.446 --> 00:32:30.656
But, it's really common
for a photo app to want

689
00:32:30.656 --> 00:32:32.066
to show lots of images.

690
00:32:32.066 --> 00:32:33.566
The user doesn't want to scroll

691
00:32:33.566 --> 00:32:34.966
through their images
one at a time.

692
00:32:35.326 --> 00:32:37.226
They want to see
a grid of images

693
00:32:37.226 --> 00:32:41.946
in either a regular square grid
or a more interesting, you know,

694
00:32:41.946 --> 00:32:43.516
tile and brick mortar layout.

695
00:32:43.816 --> 00:32:45.626
That poses some performance
problems.

696
00:32:45.626 --> 00:32:47.936
Even if the individual
images are relatively cheap,

697
00:32:47.936 --> 00:32:48.676
there's a lot of them.

698
00:32:49.216 --> 00:32:50.276
So what do we do?

699
00:32:50.276 --> 00:32:52.836
The general thing that people
want to do is you create a cache

700
00:32:52.836 --> 00:32:54.446
around what the user's
looking at.

701
00:32:54.446 --> 00:32:56.256
You figure out which
direction they're going

702
00:32:56.256 --> 00:32:58.346
and you start caching
ahead of them

703
00:32:58.346 --> 00:32:59.666
and you stop caching behind.

704
00:33:00.126 --> 00:33:01.506
So this is a pain, right?

705
00:33:01.826 --> 00:33:03.856
You kind of have to
track all of this data.

706
00:33:03.856 --> 00:33:06.276
You have to know to retrieve
stuff from that cache.

707
00:33:06.496 --> 00:33:08.676
We've already got an API
for doing a lot of this.

708
00:33:09.616 --> 00:33:13.246
And that API is the
PHCachingImageManager, okay?

709
00:33:13.766 --> 00:33:17.216
The caching image manager's job
is exactly what it sounds like.

710
00:33:17.216 --> 00:33:20.496
Its job is to cache images
on your behalf, okay?

711
00:33:20.966 --> 00:33:23.616
As you make requests against
the caching image manager,

712
00:33:23.686 --> 00:33:26.526
if it's in its cache, it
will return that directly.

713
00:33:26.526 --> 00:33:28.736
And if not, it will
automatically fall back

714
00:33:28.736 --> 00:33:30.416
to the default image
request behavior.

715
00:33:31.066 --> 00:33:33.116
Now the general suggestion is

716
00:33:33.116 --> 00:33:36.006
that you create a caching
image manager for each sort

717
00:33:36.006 --> 00:33:38.776
of distinct view controller
that you have in your app.

718
00:33:39.006 --> 00:33:41.816
That's because each view
controller typically has its own

719
00:33:41.816 --> 00:33:45.126
display of image data, right?

720
00:33:45.126 --> 00:33:47.856
You know, a grid view
controller is going to behave -

721
00:33:47.856 --> 00:33:49.596
it's going to need
different caching behaviors

722
00:33:49.596 --> 00:33:52.296
than like a one-up view where
you're scrolling through.

723
00:33:53.616 --> 00:33:55.496
So let's take a quick look at
what I'm talking about here.

724
00:33:55.496 --> 00:33:57.486
So we have the user's phone.

725
00:33:58.226 --> 00:34:00.106
They're looking at
some nice pictures

726
00:33:58.226 --> 00:34:00.106
They're looking at
some nice pictures

727
00:34:00.106 --> 00:34:01.386
and they're scrolling
through it.

728
00:34:01.676 --> 00:34:03.056
Now this is what the user sees.

729
00:34:03.996 --> 00:34:07.376
But we know that underneath what
they actually have is this sort

730
00:34:07.376 --> 00:34:10.856
of long scroll view of
photos above and behind.

731
00:34:10.956 --> 00:34:13.096
And what they only see
is the visible range.

732
00:34:13.706 --> 00:34:17.366
So as they're scrolling down,
we want to start caching ahead

733
00:34:17.366 --> 00:34:20.636
of where they are so that the
data's available immediately

734
00:34:21.085 --> 00:34:23.496
when you need to
display it to the user.

735
00:34:23.946 --> 00:34:25.616
And, of course, for
memory reasons,

736
00:34:25.616 --> 00:34:27.156
we want to stop caching behind.

737
00:34:27.505 --> 00:34:29.686
You just sort of calculate
this range and maintain it,

738
00:34:30.266 --> 00:34:32.726
and as you scroll
just keep updating.

739
00:34:33.896 --> 00:34:38.106
Okay? The API for the caching
image manager is actually

740
00:34:38.106 --> 00:34:38.936
pretty straightforward.

741
00:34:39.376 --> 00:34:42.176
You calculate what's
going to be visible soon.

742
00:34:42.406 --> 00:34:43.735
You tell us to start caching it.

743
00:34:44.366 --> 00:34:50.176
And as stuff is scrolled off,
you tell us to stop caching it.

744
00:34:50.766 --> 00:34:54.726
The only key thing here is when
you start and stop caching,

745
00:34:56.036 --> 00:34:58.936
use the same target
size, content mode,

746
00:34:58.936 --> 00:35:02.066
and options that you will use
for the actual request image.

747
00:34:58.936 --> 00:35:02.066
and options that you will use
for the actual request image.

748
00:35:02.686 --> 00:35:05.086
Otherwise, we don't
know how to look it up.

749
00:35:05.346 --> 00:35:08.976
So now we know how to get hold
of image data and we know how

750
00:35:08.976 --> 00:35:10.246
to get a hold of it fast.

751
00:35:10.806 --> 00:35:12.746
We know how to get a
hold of video data.

752
00:35:12.746 --> 00:35:16.096
But, of course, just looking
at data's only half the story.

753
00:35:16.906 --> 00:35:19.466
Users love to touch
their photos.

754
00:35:19.466 --> 00:35:22.706
They want to adjust them, crop
it so it looks just right,

755
00:35:22.706 --> 00:35:24.436
apply a filter so
their kids look,

756
00:35:24.436 --> 00:35:26.196
you know, extra special pretty.

757
00:35:26.706 --> 00:35:28.776
So let's talk about editing.

758
00:35:30.306 --> 00:35:34.316
If the asset is editable,
the edits are now in place.

759
00:35:34.906 --> 00:35:38.086
Okay? You no longer need to
save your edits as a new asset.

760
00:35:38.086 --> 00:35:41.166
You can edit any
asset that's editable.

761
00:35:41.766 --> 00:35:45.516
The edits are, just
like in the real photos

762
00:35:45.516 --> 00:35:46.566
out there, are nondestructive.

763
00:35:46.566 --> 00:35:48.036
The user can always revert.

764
00:35:48.106 --> 00:35:49.816
You can also programmatically
revert.

765
00:35:50.966 --> 00:35:53.026
Changes that you make
are visible everywhere.

766
00:35:53.306 --> 00:35:54.516
They'll show up in your app.

767
00:35:54.636 --> 00:35:55.906
They show up in the Photos app.

768
00:35:55.906 --> 00:36:00.116
They show up in mail
messages, other 3rd-party apps.

769
00:35:55.906 --> 00:36:00.116
They show up in mail
messages, other 3rd-party apps.

770
00:36:00.666 --> 00:36:04.256
And with iCloud Photo Library
they're actually visible

771
00:36:04.256 --> 00:36:05.956
across all of your
devices as well.

772
00:36:07.166 --> 00:36:09.556
Okay. So how does editing work?

773
00:36:10.156 --> 00:36:14.586
Well, at a very simple,
basic level,

774
00:36:14.666 --> 00:36:16.606
you ask us for an input image.

775
00:36:18.066 --> 00:36:21.036
We hand it to you.

776
00:36:21.146 --> 00:36:24.196
And you do whatever
transformations you want

777
00:36:24.196 --> 00:36:24.706
to do on it.

778
00:36:24.706 --> 00:36:25.496
You can crop it.

779
00:36:25.496 --> 00:36:26.356
You can edit it.

780
00:36:26.356 --> 00:36:30.456
You can go and do, you know,
pixel operations on it.

781
00:36:30.456 --> 00:36:33.956
And when you're done,
you generate a new image,

782
00:36:33.956 --> 00:36:36.746
a new output image,
and you hand it to us,

783
00:36:36.746 --> 00:36:38.316
and then we save it
on top of the asset.

784
00:36:39.366 --> 00:36:39.756
That's it.

785
00:36:40.676 --> 00:36:43.976
So let's take a look at
how that works, okay?

786
00:36:44.836 --> 00:36:47.016
First you want to ask
us for the input image.

787
00:36:47.586 --> 00:36:52.386
You ask the asset for its
content editing input, okay?

788
00:36:53.056 --> 00:36:54.876
And what that comes with is,

789
00:36:54.876 --> 00:36:57.516
the content editing input
carries a bunch of information

790
00:36:57.516 --> 00:37:00.746
that you'll need in order
to actually do your work.

791
00:36:57.516 --> 00:37:00.746
that you'll need in order
to actually do your work.

792
00:37:01.086 --> 00:37:03.076
It gives you a URL
with a reference

793
00:37:03.076 --> 00:37:04.236
to the full size asset.

794
00:37:04.456 --> 00:37:06.376
It gives you some
orientation information.

795
00:37:06.946 --> 00:37:10.026
So, in this case, I'm
creating a Core Image image

796
00:37:10.476 --> 00:37:11.936
and I'm sure I'm
going to be using some

797
00:37:11.936 --> 00:37:14.656
of the new filter stuff that
we have available for you now.

798
00:37:15.266 --> 00:37:17.566
And I'm going to do some work.

799
00:37:17.876 --> 00:37:19.896
So, I've done some work.

800
00:37:19.896 --> 00:37:20.696
You just cropped it.

801
00:37:20.866 --> 00:37:22.006
Maybe you applied a filter.

802
00:37:22.006 --> 00:37:22.546
It looks great.

803
00:37:23.656 --> 00:37:24.326
How do we save it?

804
00:37:26.006 --> 00:37:29.126
Well, you create, ta-da,
a Content Editing Output.

805
00:37:30.166 --> 00:37:33.876
You take your data, the
fully-rendered output,

806
00:37:33.876 --> 00:37:36.056
save it as a JPEG,
write it to the URL,

807
00:37:36.056 --> 00:37:38.296
and then you set
the adjustmentData.

808
00:37:39.006 --> 00:37:40.876
I'll talk about the
adjustmentData in just a second.

809
00:37:41.176 --> 00:37:42.676
And then how do you save it?

810
00:37:42.676 --> 00:37:45.196
It's the same as saving
any other model change.

811
00:37:45.556 --> 00:37:49.016
You create an
PHAssetChangeRequest.

812
00:37:49.556 --> 00:37:51.506
You sent the content
editing output on it,

813
00:37:52.416 --> 00:37:54.706
put the whole thing in a
change block, and that's it.

814
00:37:55.406 --> 00:37:57.806
So, it's a little
bit misleading,

815
00:37:57.806 --> 00:37:59.516
actually when I said
it was that simple.

816
00:37:59.726 --> 00:38:02.476
So there's another
wrinkle, which is,

817
00:37:59.726 --> 00:38:02.476
So there's another
wrinkle, which is,

818
00:38:03.036 --> 00:38:07.926
what if someone has
already edited that image?

819
00:38:08.926 --> 00:38:12.176
Well, the key point
here is that actually

820
00:38:12.766 --> 00:38:17.426
when you edit an image you
actually have the base image

821
00:38:18.136 --> 00:38:19.296
and some adjustment data.

822
00:38:19.626 --> 00:38:21.916
Your output image, the thing
that you give us at the end,

823
00:38:21.916 --> 00:38:22.866
is actually the result

824
00:38:22.866 --> 00:38:25.656
of applying this
adjustment to the base image.

825
00:38:26.266 --> 00:38:31.846
So, really, what we hand you
is the base image plus whatever

826
00:38:31.846 --> 00:38:33.926
adjustment data is
already on that image.

827
00:38:34.896 --> 00:38:37.266
And that way the user
can continue editing

828
00:38:37.406 --> 00:38:41.286
as if they had never left
their editing session, right?

829
00:38:41.486 --> 00:38:45.726
You do a crop-down and then what
we hand you is the original plus

830
00:38:45.726 --> 00:38:48.286
the crop information so that
you can show the user the crop,

831
00:38:48.286 --> 00:38:50.366
that they can extend
the crop in and out.

832
00:38:50.366 --> 00:38:51.546
They can remove it entirely.

833
00:38:51.546 --> 00:38:52.266
They can change it.

834
00:38:52.926 --> 00:38:58.436
And when you're done, you
hand us your output image

835
00:38:59.536 --> 00:39:01.216
and the new adjustment data.

836
00:38:59.536 --> 00:39:01.216
and the new adjustment data.

837
00:39:01.536 --> 00:39:03.006
So that cycle will
just continue.

838
00:39:03.006 --> 00:39:06.286
So the next person that asks
will get back the base image

839
00:39:06.286 --> 00:39:08.426
plus the new adjustment data.

840
00:39:09.736 --> 00:39:11.886
So how do you save
the adjustment data?

841
00:39:11.886 --> 00:39:13.876
Well, the adjustment
data actually can be -

842
00:39:13.876 --> 00:39:16.336
you use a PHAdjustmentData
object,

843
00:39:16.336 --> 00:39:20.116
but really the data can be
whatever you want, all right?

844
00:39:20.486 --> 00:39:22.926
For instance, it could be
the name and parameters

845
00:39:22.926 --> 00:39:24.236
for a Core Image filter.

846
00:39:24.456 --> 00:39:28.586
It could be anything that you
want that describes your edits.

847
00:39:30.226 --> 00:39:33.596
Notice here that actually beyond
just that data we also ask you

848
00:39:33.596 --> 00:39:36.296
to include a format
identifier and a format version.

849
00:39:37.616 --> 00:39:40.146
They basically are a way for you

850
00:39:40.146 --> 00:39:43.766
to identify what
edit it actually is.

851
00:39:43.766 --> 00:39:44.906
Who did this edit?

852
00:39:44.906 --> 00:39:46.156
What's the format of it?

853
00:39:46.666 --> 00:39:50.266
Okay? And I'll talk a little
bit more about that in a second.

854
00:39:50.756 --> 00:39:54.286
So, I misled you again.

855
00:39:54.746 --> 00:39:56.636
There is one additional
case, of course.

856
00:39:57.156 --> 00:39:59.976
What if someone else
had edited the image?

857
00:40:00.076 --> 00:40:04.786
The scenario that I
described before is great

858
00:40:04.786 --> 00:40:07.046
if you were the one who
previously edited it.

859
00:40:07.046 --> 00:40:11.106
But if somebody went to App
A and they applied a crop?

860
00:40:11.106 --> 00:40:15.926
And then they go to App B and
they want to do more editing?

861
00:40:16.236 --> 00:40:19.216
Well, you have to tell us
whether you understand the

862
00:40:19.216 --> 00:40:19.866
adjustment data.

863
00:40:19.866 --> 00:40:20.516
We'll ask you.

864
00:40:20.516 --> 00:40:21.896
We'll give you the
PHAdjustmentData.

865
00:40:22.776 --> 00:40:23.496
And you tell us.

866
00:40:23.986 --> 00:40:25.376
Do you understand what this is?

867
00:40:25.836 --> 00:40:26.596
So, looking at this,

868
00:40:26.596 --> 00:40:28.666
this actually seems
relatively straightforward

869
00:40:28.986 --> 00:40:30.566
but we're not putting
any restrictions

870
00:40:30.566 --> 00:40:33.136
on what the format identifier
and the format version can be.

871
00:40:33.666 --> 00:40:35.956
Several developers from
different companies could,

872
00:40:35.956 --> 00:40:39.106
for instance, get together
and define a common identifier

873
00:40:39.106 --> 00:40:42.066
and version and, you know,
adjustment data format.

874
00:40:42.066 --> 00:40:45.226
And that way the user could move
seamlessly between those apps.

875
00:40:45.226 --> 00:40:48.146
Okay. But let's see
what happens,

876
00:40:48.236 --> 00:40:51.416
depending on what you return
when we ask you this question,

877
00:40:51.416 --> 00:40:53.176
can you understand this?

878
00:40:53.436 --> 00:40:55.026
Do you understand it?

879
00:40:55.406 --> 00:40:56.566
Yes. You say, yes.

880
00:40:56.746 --> 00:40:57.276
That's great.

881
00:40:57.516 --> 00:41:00.706
We'll hand you the base
image and the adjustment data

882
00:40:57.516 --> 00:41:00.706
We'll hand you the base
image and the adjustment data

883
00:41:00.706 --> 00:41:03.786
and you can behave as if
the user had just sort

884
00:41:03.786 --> 00:41:05.616
of turned around, waited
a second, and come back

885
00:41:05.616 --> 00:41:06.706
and started editing again.

886
00:41:07.266 --> 00:41:08.656
That's sort of the ideal case.

887
00:41:08.946 --> 00:41:12.336
But what if you tell
no, you don't?

888
00:41:12.636 --> 00:41:13.886
Well, in this case,
unfortunately,

889
00:41:13.886 --> 00:41:14.816
we don't have any choice.

890
00:41:14.816 --> 00:41:16.826
We have to hand you the
fully rendered output

891
00:41:16.826 --> 00:41:17.706
from the previous edit.

892
00:41:17.706 --> 00:41:21.576
So the user can continue
editing but they can't back out.

893
00:41:21.576 --> 00:41:25.336
Like, in this case, the previous
app applied a noir filter

894
00:41:25.576 --> 00:41:27.346
and it's effectively
blocking my filter.

895
00:41:27.346 --> 00:41:29.036
We've thrown away the
color information.

896
00:41:29.036 --> 00:41:29.536
We don't have it.

897
00:41:30.206 --> 00:41:33.206
If the user wants to go
back, they basically have

898
00:41:33.236 --> 00:41:34.486
to revert back to original.

899
00:41:35.326 --> 00:41:38.186
Okay. So, let's take
a quick demo.

900
00:41:39.196 --> 00:41:39.836
So, here we are.

901
00:41:40.446 --> 00:41:41.866
So, this is what we had before.

902
00:41:42.586 --> 00:41:44.436
And I want to take a look.

903
00:41:45.956 --> 00:41:46.536
Let's see.

904
00:41:46.536 --> 00:41:47.916
Let's look at our
Favorites again.

905
00:41:49.636 --> 00:41:51.476
And here we go.

906
00:41:51.986 --> 00:41:52.856
She looks very nice.

907
00:41:53.926 --> 00:41:55.606
But I want to play
with it a little bit.

908
00:41:55.606 --> 00:41:57.296
I think that this
photo could be better.

909
00:41:58.706 --> 00:42:02.006
So, actually, I'm going
to - let's try Posterize.

910
00:41:58.706 --> 00:42:02.006
So, actually, I'm going
to - let's try Posterize.

911
00:42:03.066 --> 00:42:03.876
You know what?

912
00:42:03.876 --> 00:42:06.106
I didn't - I don't know.

913
00:42:06.176 --> 00:42:07.816
That doesn't look
quite right to me.

914
00:42:08.706 --> 00:42:11.496
Okay? So at this point we
started with the original image

915
00:42:11.496 --> 00:42:12.566
and there are no adjustments.

916
00:42:12.566 --> 00:42:14.206
So we didn't even ask,
"Do you understand?"

917
00:42:14.206 --> 00:42:14.906
because it doesn't matter.

918
00:42:15.336 --> 00:42:16.326
We have the base image.

919
00:42:16.656 --> 00:42:18.796
This time, when I go
into edit, what's going

920
00:42:18.796 --> 00:42:22.496
to happen is we're going to
say, do you understand the edit?

921
00:42:22.496 --> 00:42:24.536
And this app happens
to be the same app.

922
00:42:24.536 --> 00:42:25.816
So I says yes, I understand.

923
00:42:26.156 --> 00:42:29.386
So this time I hand
you the base image,

924
00:42:29.846 --> 00:42:32.826
which is effectively the
original, plus the adjustment

925
00:42:32.826 --> 00:42:35.946
that did the Posterize
which allows us

926
00:42:37.236 --> 00:42:38.206
to switch it completely.

927
00:42:38.206 --> 00:42:40.386
And now it's in Sepia, right?

928
00:42:40.436 --> 00:42:43.116
But it's not sepia applied
on top of the Posterize.

929
00:42:43.116 --> 00:42:45.466
It's Sepia applied
instead of the Posterize.

930
00:42:45.896 --> 00:42:46.876
Actually, I kind of like this.

931
00:42:46.876 --> 00:42:47.796
I think I'm going to leave it.

932
00:42:47.796 --> 00:42:50.096
I like that old-time look.

933
00:42:50.796 --> 00:42:53.206
And just to prove it, look.

934
00:42:54.386 --> 00:42:55.706
The Photos app sees it as well.

935
00:42:57.286 --> 00:42:57.676
All right.

936
00:42:58.036 --> 00:43:00.466
So we've talked about
doing this in the context

937
00:42:58.036 --> 00:43:00.466
So we've talked about
doing this in the context

938
00:43:00.466 --> 00:43:03.376
of your own application,
but, of course, as we showed

939
00:43:03.376 --> 00:43:05.886
in the Keynote, we can
do this from inside

940
00:43:05.886 --> 00:43:06.926
of the Photos app as well.

941
00:43:06.986 --> 00:43:09.816
And to tell you about how
to do that, Simon Bovet.

942
00:43:11.516 --> 00:43:16.736
[ Applause ]

943
00:43:17.236 --> 00:43:18.656
>> Good morning.

944
00:43:18.876 --> 00:43:20.376
My name is Simon Bovet.

945
00:43:20.376 --> 00:43:22.616
And in this last
part of the session,

946
00:43:22.966 --> 00:43:24.876
let's talk about Photo
Editing Extensions.

947
00:43:26.326 --> 00:43:28.206
So what are Photo
Editing Extensions?

948
00:43:28.676 --> 00:43:30.626
How can they be useful
to you developers?

949
00:43:31.086 --> 00:43:32.716
And what do they
bring to our users?

950
00:43:32.796 --> 00:43:39.856
So it's a new feature in iOS 8
that allows the users to access

951
00:43:39.966 --> 00:43:44.846
to your Image or Video
Editing tool right

952
00:43:44.846 --> 00:43:49.076
from within the built-in
camera or photo applications.

953
00:43:50.486 --> 00:43:52.856
No need for the user to
switch between applications.

954
00:43:53.136 --> 00:43:56.036
No need for the user to
grant specific access rights

955
00:43:56.036 --> 00:43:56.876
to your application.

956
00:43:57.206 --> 00:44:01.696
It's a very simple way for your
tool to reach its audience.

957
00:43:57.206 --> 00:44:01.696
It's a very simple way for your
tool to reach its audience.

958
00:44:02.226 --> 00:44:03.606
And we think it's a great way

959
00:44:03.836 --> 00:44:07.096
to put your creativity inside
the hands of our users.

960
00:44:08.086 --> 00:44:11.326
So this feature has been shown
in the Keynote on Monday,

961
00:44:11.326 --> 00:44:13.356
but let me refresh your
memories with a few slides.

962
00:44:14.256 --> 00:44:20.346
So here we are on iPhone editing
an image using the iOS 8's

963
00:44:20.446 --> 00:44:22.036
built-in Photos application.

964
00:44:22.996 --> 00:44:25.966
The user can tap on
the top left button

965
00:44:26.796 --> 00:44:29.576
and access any available
editing extension.

966
00:44:30.596 --> 00:44:31.266
Can pick one.

967
00:44:31.946 --> 00:44:37.326
And this could be your Editing
tool extending the reading

968
00:44:37.326 --> 00:44:39.056
capabilities of the
built-in apps.

969
00:44:39.876 --> 00:44:41.326
So now the user can interact

970
00:44:41.326 --> 00:44:43.036
with whatever interface
you want to provide.

971
00:44:43.676 --> 00:44:47.796
And when the user is done,
the changes are saved right

972
00:44:47.796 --> 00:44:50.156
in place inside the
user's photo library.

973
00:44:50.626 --> 00:44:52.686
No need to create the
duplicated assets.

974
00:44:53.506 --> 00:44:56.276
And if the user has turned
on iCloud Photo Library,

975
00:44:56.916 --> 00:44:59.986
those changes will be
applied to all of the devices.

976
00:45:00.436 --> 00:45:01.766
So the user could go on his iPad

977
00:45:01.766 --> 00:45:04.896
and then draw your beautiful
effects on a larger screen.

978
00:45:06.036 --> 00:45:09.386
So, what do you need to
create your own photo

979
00:45:09.386 --> 00:45:10.426
editing extension?

980
00:45:11.576 --> 00:45:13.426
And it turns out that
it's really simple.

981
00:45:13.926 --> 00:45:15.236
It's basically three steps.

982
00:45:15.916 --> 00:45:18.606
The first one is to create
an app extension target.

983
00:45:19.896 --> 00:45:22.016
The second one is to
provide a view controller

984
00:45:22.336 --> 00:45:24.556
which will manage the
UI of your extension.

985
00:45:25.406 --> 00:45:27.286
And then this view
controller needs

986
00:45:27.286 --> 00:45:31.216
to adopt a specific protocol
which is a set of methods

987
00:45:31.736 --> 00:45:33.546
that Photos will call in order

988
00:45:33.546 --> 00:45:34.926
to communicate with
your extension.

989
00:45:35.456 --> 00:45:41.966
The good news is the first two
steps are really easy thanks

990
00:45:41.966 --> 00:45:42.886
to the new Xcode.

991
00:45:44.186 --> 00:45:46.196
Basically all that
you need to do is,

992
00:45:46.196 --> 00:45:49.856
from your application's Xcode
project, add a new target

993
00:45:50.846 --> 00:45:53.506
and select the Photo
Editing Extension template.

994
00:45:54.496 --> 00:45:57.736
Xcode will create whatever is
necessary for you go get started

995
00:45:58.156 --> 00:45:59.306
and have something working.

996
00:46:00.406 --> 00:46:04.026
It will create a view controller
which you can start using

997
00:46:04.836 --> 00:46:07.266
or which you can replace
with your own if you happen

998
00:46:07.266 --> 00:46:10.026
to have your existing
tool or view controller

999
00:46:10.026 --> 00:46:10.926
that you want to reuse.

1000
00:46:11.456 --> 00:46:13.196
A note about the user interface.

1001
00:46:14.506 --> 00:46:16.866
You've seen photo extensions
are shown fullscreen.

1002
00:46:17.746 --> 00:46:21.116
Now on the top bar, with the
Cancel and Done buttons as well

1003
00:46:21.116 --> 00:46:23.666
as the title of your
application,

1004
00:46:24.046 --> 00:46:26.396
it's shown automatically
for you by the Photos app.

1005
00:46:27.646 --> 00:46:30.636
So if you, say, you'd like
to design your extension not

1006
00:46:30.636 --> 00:46:32.076
to have its own navigation bar.

1007
00:46:34.886 --> 00:46:38.096
Now onto the protocol
adoption, so the protocol

1008
00:46:38.096 --> 00:46:39.946
which is specific
to photo extensions.

1009
00:46:41.186 --> 00:46:44.276
And this protocol is defining
the photo's UIFramework

1010
00:46:44.926 --> 00:46:47.426
and is the
PHContentEditingController.

1011
00:46:48.276 --> 00:46:49.696
It consists of four methods.

1012
00:46:50.336 --> 00:46:53.536
And the first one,
quite obviously,

1013
00:46:54.116 --> 00:46:57.066
is called when the user
selects your extension.

1014
00:46:57.796 --> 00:47:02.056
And this where you get the input
data before your extension is

1015
00:46:57.796 --> 00:47:02.056
And this where you get the input
data before your extension is

1016
00:47:02.056 --> 00:47:02.986
presented onscreen.

1017
00:47:03.626 --> 00:47:09.446
A simple implementation
could look like this.

1018
00:47:09.656 --> 00:47:12.966
And the first thing you might
notice is that the input object

1019
00:47:12.966 --> 00:47:15.586
which is given to you,
the PHContentEditingInput,

1020
00:47:15.646 --> 00:47:17.686
is exactly the same object

1021
00:47:17.936 --> 00:47:20.496
as the one Karl described
just a few minutes ago.

1022
00:47:21.086 --> 00:47:23.286
So, basically, we have
the exact same classes,

1023
00:47:23.286 --> 00:47:26.746
the exact same concepts, as
when editing a photo using the

1024
00:47:26.746 --> 00:47:29.986
photo's framework just here
wrapped slightly differently

1025
00:47:29.986 --> 00:47:31.776
for the specific
needs of an extension.

1026
00:47:33.116 --> 00:47:37.256
So, you would typically
read out the input image.

1027
00:47:37.676 --> 00:47:39.236
In this particular case
we're going to work

1028
00:47:39.236 --> 00:47:40.876
with a display-size
representation.

1029
00:47:41.116 --> 00:47:43.146
We don't need the full-size
image right away here.

1030
00:47:43.836 --> 00:47:46.716
Then we're going to decode
any input.adjustmentData

1031
00:47:47.226 --> 00:47:50.076
or fall back to some default
settings if there's none.

1032
00:47:51.156 --> 00:47:55.526
Then you set up your user
interface the way you need it.

1033
00:47:55.526 --> 00:47:57.486
And you typically find
it's useful to hold

1034
00:47:57.486 --> 00:47:59.566
on to the input object
that was given to you.

1035
00:48:00.316 --> 00:48:03.396
Now the user will interact
with your extension.

1036
00:48:03.626 --> 00:48:06.846
And when the user is done, the
second method will be called.

1037
00:48:07.616 --> 00:48:09.386
And this is when your extension,

1038
00:48:09.746 --> 00:48:13.796
we need to provide the final
output data and hand it back.

1039
00:48:15.126 --> 00:48:17.406
Second implementation
can look like this.

1040
00:48:18.286 --> 00:48:20.976
For images, you drag
a JPEG representation

1041
00:48:20.976 --> 00:48:23.706
of the full-size image with
your effects applied to it.

1042
00:48:24.396 --> 00:48:26.466
You still create this
adjustment's data object

1043
00:48:26.466 --> 00:48:30.026
which describe whatever you've
applied to the input image.

1044
00:48:30.716 --> 00:48:32.266
And then you create
an output object

1045
00:48:32.266 --> 00:48:34.026
that wraps all this information.

1046
00:48:34.506 --> 00:48:36.676
And when you're done, you
call the completionHandler.

1047
00:48:39.036 --> 00:48:42.736
You notice in this example
that the flow is synchronous,

1048
00:48:42.996 --> 00:48:43.856
but it doesn't have to be.

1049
00:48:44.256 --> 00:48:46.196
If you prefer to have an
asynchronous workflow,

1050
00:48:46.196 --> 00:48:46.946
it's totally fine.

1051
00:48:47.226 --> 00:48:49.156
You just have to call
the completionHandler

1052
00:48:49.546 --> 00:48:50.946
when your output is ready.

1053
00:48:55.296 --> 00:48:59.206
Now you remember the story
about resuming editing.

1054
00:48:59.496 --> 00:49:03.736
So we imagine that the user
selects your extension using an

1055
00:48:59.496 --> 00:49:03.736
So we imagine that the user
selects your extension using an

1056
00:49:03.736 --> 00:49:06.086
image or a video that
already has been edited

1057
00:49:06.086 --> 00:49:07.696
and that has some
adjustments data.

1058
00:49:08.766 --> 00:49:11.766
You remember the first
question that we asked you is,

1059
00:49:12.106 --> 00:49:16.206
do you understand that given the
existing adjustment data on it,

1060
00:49:16.206 --> 00:49:18.996
and that way we can provide
you with the appropriate input.

1061
00:49:19.596 --> 00:49:26.356
And this is when this method can
handle adjustments data is going

1062
00:49:26.356 --> 00:49:28.016
to get called a new extension.

1063
00:49:28.576 --> 00:49:32.706
And, typically, implementation
could be as simple

1064
00:49:32.706 --> 00:49:36.926
as checking whether you support
the formatIdentifier and version

1065
00:49:36.926 --> 00:49:38.956
of this adjustment data.

1066
00:49:38.956 --> 00:49:42.596
And, finally, the last
method pretty obviously is

1067
00:49:42.596 --> 00:49:45.056
when the user cancels
your extension.

1068
00:49:45.936 --> 00:49:47.766
One thing to notice,
which isn't obvious,

1069
00:49:47.766 --> 00:49:50.126
is that this method can
be called at any time.

1070
00:49:50.906 --> 00:49:53.616
So, for example, if your
extension requires some time

1071
00:49:53.616 --> 00:49:55.476
to produce the output
- for example,

1072
00:49:55.476 --> 00:49:58.786
you're editing a video
- the user could decide

1073
00:49:58.786 --> 00:50:00.976
to interrupt you and cancel
right away at any time.

1074
00:49:58.786 --> 00:50:00.976
to interrupt you and cancel
right away at any time.

1075
00:50:01.046 --> 00:50:05.996
So just keep that in mind.

1076
00:50:06.146 --> 00:50:09.196
And this is basically
all what you need

1077
00:50:09.556 --> 00:50:11.646
to create your own
photo editing extension.

1078
00:50:12.126 --> 00:50:15.796
So we are really excited to see
all the tools that you are going

1079
00:50:15.796 --> 00:50:17.936
to create and all the great
ideas that you are going

1080
00:50:17.936 --> 00:50:20.336
to provide to our
users using this API.

1081
00:50:21.096 --> 00:50:26.336
And let me conclude with a
short demo of that in action.

1082
00:50:30.056 --> 00:50:32.926
So let's switch to
our demo device.

1083
00:50:33.546 --> 00:50:38.966
And I'm going to go to
the Photos application.

1084
00:50:40.376 --> 00:50:43.906
And here is the image
that has been just applied

1085
00:50:43.906 --> 00:50:47.056
or just has been edited by
Karl with this Sepia filter.

1086
00:50:47.896 --> 00:50:50.746
Now it turns out that this
simple app is actually vending a

1087
00:50:50.746 --> 00:50:51.936
photo editing extension.

1088
00:50:52.316 --> 00:50:56.096
So what I can do is right from
within the Photos app, tap Edit,

1089
00:50:56.676 --> 00:51:00.106
select the top left
extension button,

1090
00:50:56.676 --> 00:51:00.106
select the top left
extension button,

1091
00:51:00.536 --> 00:51:02.446
and here you see our
sample extension.

1092
00:51:02.716 --> 00:51:04.326
So let me select it.

1093
00:51:05.276 --> 00:51:08.336
And what I can do is not
only apply our filters

1094
00:51:08.336 --> 00:51:10.966
but I can also resume what
was previously edited.

1095
00:51:11.476 --> 00:51:14.056
So, for example, I could decide
here to bring back the colors

1096
00:51:14.316 --> 00:51:15.856
and even enhance them.

1097
00:51:15.996 --> 00:51:17.776
So I'm going to replace
the Sepia filter

1098
00:51:17.776 --> 00:51:19.906
that was previously
applied and I'm going

1099
00:51:19.906 --> 00:51:21.756
to choose a Chrome filter.

1100
00:51:23.116 --> 00:51:25.226
And that's it.

1101
00:51:26.306 --> 00:51:29.376
You see how easy it is for
the user in just a few taps

1102
00:51:29.906 --> 00:51:32.386
to use your photo
editing extension.

1103
00:51:38.136 --> 00:51:40.496
So time to wrap up this session.

1104
00:51:41.376 --> 00:51:42.226
What have we learned?

1105
00:51:42.466 --> 00:51:45.806
We've introduced the new Photos
framework which allows you

1106
00:51:45.806 --> 00:51:49.936
to access the user's
photo library

1107
00:51:50.186 --> 00:51:51.826
and which allows
your application

1108
00:51:52.836 --> 00:51:56.726
to gain all the features like
the one which we provided

1109
00:51:56.726 --> 00:51:57.926
with the Photos application.

1110
00:51:58.506 --> 00:52:02.086
So your app can be a
first-class citizen

1111
00:51:58.506 --> 00:52:02.086
So your app can be a
first-class citizen

1112
00:52:02.086 --> 00:52:03.956
of the iOS Photos ecosystem.

1113
00:52:04.566 --> 00:52:06.546
And then we've seen
how easy it is for you

1114
00:52:06.896 --> 00:52:09.266
to provide your Editing
tool using the photos

1115
00:52:09.266 --> 00:52:10.216
editing extensions.

1116
00:52:10.896 --> 00:52:15.096
If you want more information
you can contact our Evangelist,

1117
00:52:15.096 --> 00:52:15.836
Allan Schaffer.

1118
00:52:16.056 --> 00:52:17.606
You can read our documentation.

1119
00:52:17.946 --> 00:52:21.046
And if you want to ask questions
or find answers, you can check

1120
00:52:21.046 --> 00:52:22.776
out our Developer Forums.

1121
00:52:23.496 --> 00:52:26.006
We have a couple of
related sessions.

1122
00:52:26.646 --> 00:52:28.176
Some of them have
already taken place.

1123
00:52:28.176 --> 00:52:30.246
So check out the
videos, like the one

1124
00:52:30.246 --> 00:52:33.716
about what extensions you
can create on iOS and OS X

1125
00:52:33.846 --> 00:52:36.006
or how you can capture content

1126
00:52:36.006 --> 00:52:39.706
from the camera using even
more control on iOS 8.

1127
00:52:40.566 --> 00:52:43.026
And we have two sessions
taking place this afternoon

1128
00:52:43.616 --> 00:52:47.156
if you're interested in knowing
more about how to edit images

1129
00:52:47.156 --> 00:52:49.956
and apply your custom
filters using Core Image.

1130
00:52:50.996 --> 00:52:53.486
And with that, I thank you
very much for your attention.

1131
00:52:54.016 --> 00:52:54.956
Enjoy the rest of the show.

1132
00:52:55.516 --> 00:53:06.980
