1
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:14.716
>> Good morning.

2
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:18.846
And welcome to WWDC
session on iAd Workbench.

3
00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:22.726
I'm Paresh Rajwat and I'm
here with my colleague,

4
00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:26.616
Ravi Chittari, to share with
you how we're evolving the iAd

5
00:00:26.616 --> 00:00:27.626
Workbench platform.

6
00:00:28.116 --> 00:00:31.576
We have some awesome stuff we
are bringing to you this fall,

7
00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:33.656
and I can't wait to
share it with you.

8
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:37.996
But before we go there, knowing
some of you are probably new

9
00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:41.406
to advertising, and perhaps
hearing the word iAd Workbench

10
00:00:41.406 --> 00:00:42.236
for the first time.

11
00:00:43.046 --> 00:00:45.426
Let's start with two
foundational questions.

12
00:00:46.626 --> 00:00:47.576
Why advertise?

13
00:00:49.196 --> 00:00:49.956
And why iAd?

14
00:00:49.956 --> 00:00:54.136
Let's start with the first
question: why advertise.

15
00:00:54.736 --> 00:00:59.806
Say you developed this app, you
put a lot of time and energy

16
00:00:59.806 --> 00:01:04.426
in it and you put
it on the App Store.

17
00:00:59.806 --> 00:01:04.426
in it and you put
it on the App Store.

18
00:01:04.616 --> 00:01:05.966
Now two things can happen.

19
00:01:06.856 --> 00:01:11.526
First, users can find
your app, or second,

20
00:01:12.086 --> 00:01:14.506
you can find users for your app.

21
00:01:15.126 --> 00:01:18.276
Users will find your app
if they know about you,

22
00:01:19.726 --> 00:01:21.336
or your app is featured in one

23
00:01:21.336 --> 00:01:24.726
of the categories
in the App Store.

24
00:01:24.926 --> 00:01:27.076
But with thousands
of apps coming

25
00:01:27.076 --> 00:01:30.586
on the App Store every
day, natural discovery

26
00:01:30.586 --> 00:01:33.206
of your app becomes
increasingly difficult

27
00:01:33.936 --> 00:01:35.986
and you don't have
much control on it.

28
00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:39.136
So what can you do
to take more control

29
00:01:39.496 --> 00:01:43.436
of the success of your app?

30
00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:44.776
You can advertise.

31
00:01:45.946 --> 00:01:49.036
When you advertise, you
can find the right users

32
00:01:49.656 --> 00:01:50.716
that will make the difference.

33
00:01:51.736 --> 00:01:56.116
And when it comes to advertising
your apps or your products

34
00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:59.786
to millions of Apple
costumers around the world,

35
00:02:01.116 --> 00:02:03.376
iAd is your best choice.

36
00:02:04.756 --> 00:02:11.316
Why? Because iAd is part of
Apple, and we know Apple users,

37
00:02:12.286 --> 00:02:14.036
all 800 million of them.

38
00:02:15.146 --> 00:02:18.886
We know what apps and other
items content they downloaded

39
00:02:19.606 --> 00:02:22.236
and we know how and
when they use it.

40
00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:26.966
Last June, we introduced
iAd Workbench.

41
00:02:27.886 --> 00:02:31.066
It's self-service mobile
advertising platform

42
00:02:32.046 --> 00:02:36.186
that provides you the simplest
way to promote your product

43
00:02:37.046 --> 00:02:38.846
to millions of Apple
users around the world.

44
00:02:39.256 --> 00:02:42.496
Since we introduced
iAd Workbench,

45
00:02:42.766 --> 00:02:44.906
we have successfully
helped developers,

46
00:02:46.076 --> 00:02:50.056
many of them advertising for the
very first time, drive millions

47
00:02:50.056 --> 00:02:52.706
of visits to their
iTunes product pages.

48
00:02:54.026 --> 00:02:56.906
iAd Workbench is
open to everyone.

49
00:02:57.986 --> 00:03:01.506
And you can promote
anything using iAd Workbench.

50
00:02:57.986 --> 00:03:01.506
And you can promote
anything using iAd Workbench.

51
00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:03.796
You can promote your apps.

52
00:03:04.866 --> 00:03:08.436
You can promote your products,
your brands, your service,

53
00:03:08.436 --> 00:03:11.256
including your iTunes content,

54
00:03:11.646 --> 00:03:14.656
whether it's music,
books or movies.

55
00:03:15.256 --> 00:03:19.756
Last June when we
introduced iAd Workbench,

56
00:03:19.976 --> 00:03:22.266
we started in the U.S.
as the first market.

57
00:03:22.266 --> 00:03:24.896
And then a few months
after that,

58
00:03:25.416 --> 00:03:26.886
we expanded internationally.

59
00:03:27.556 --> 00:03:31.136
iAd Workbench is now
available in 14 countries

60
00:03:32.046 --> 00:03:33.116
and expanding rapidly.

61
00:03:33.686 --> 00:03:37.986
Now creating a campaign using
iAd Workbench is very easy.

62
00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:41.536
You can create one in
just a few minutes.

63
00:03:42.856 --> 00:03:48.036
To demonstrate, why don't I have
Ravi show you how easy it is

64
00:03:48.036 --> 00:03:49.446
to advertise using
iAd Workbench.

65
00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:51.256
>> Thank you, Paresh.

66
00:03:52.456 --> 00:03:53.256
Good morning everyone.

67
00:03:54.066 --> 00:03:56.206
I'm Ravi Chittari from
iAd Engineering team.

68
00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:58.566
I'm here to demo iAd Workbench.

69
00:03:58.996 --> 00:04:06.256
In this demo, you will see how
easy it is to promote an app.

70
00:03:58.996 --> 00:04:06.256
In this demo, you will see how
easy it is to promote an app.

71
00:04:06.506 --> 00:04:10.656
During this demo, you will see
several options, but I'm going

72
00:04:10.656 --> 00:04:13.196
to focus on a few and
will cover more later.

73
00:04:14.306 --> 00:04:15.786
Let's get started.

74
00:04:17.546 --> 00:04:21.666
iAd Workbench is accessible
through iadworkbench.apple.com.

75
00:04:22.406 --> 00:04:25.846
All you need is an
Apple ID to log in.

76
00:04:26.116 --> 00:04:30.026
When you log in, the first page
you go to is the Dashboard.

77
00:04:30.996 --> 00:04:32.926
Dashboard is a summary
of all the campaigns,

78
00:04:33.896 --> 00:04:35.266
and also it gives basic metrics.

79
00:04:35.896 --> 00:04:38.156
To get into the campaign
creation flow,

80
00:04:38.636 --> 00:04:39.916
let's click on Create Campaign.

81
00:04:44.836 --> 00:04:47.486
The first choice you have is
what do you want to promote?

82
00:04:48.896 --> 00:04:50.316
App or a Product?

83
00:04:52.076 --> 00:04:55.096
Let's select App.

84
00:04:55.346 --> 00:04:59.256
Below are the three apps that
are published to the App Store

85
00:04:59.606 --> 00:05:01.846
from my developer account.

86
00:04:59.606 --> 00:05:01.846
from my developer account.

87
00:05:01.846 --> 00:05:05.416
iAd Workbench automatically gets
all the apps that you published

88
00:05:05.416 --> 00:05:07.786
to the App Store and
makes it available here

89
00:05:08.606 --> 00:05:11.666
so you can promote
through campaigns.

90
00:05:12.176 --> 00:05:13.716
Let me select Klara.

91
00:05:13.716 --> 00:05:19.896
For a bid type, my goal
is to drive downloads.

92
00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:22.786
I'm going to select
CPC, cost per click.

93
00:05:23.246 --> 00:05:26.506
Let me name my campaign.

94
00:05:34.136 --> 00:05:37.966
Clicking on Next will take
me to step 2, Targeting.

95
00:05:38.826 --> 00:05:40.936
Targeting is all about
finding the right audience

96
00:05:40.936 --> 00:05:41.546
for your campaign.

97
00:05:41.546 --> 00:05:44.746
We have two options,
Auto and Manual.

98
00:05:45.766 --> 00:05:49.166
In case of Auto, iAd finds
the right audience for you.

99
00:05:49.716 --> 00:05:52.786
In case of Manual, you get to
set the targeting preferences.

100
00:05:53.226 --> 00:05:55.956
Let me set up Auto.

101
00:05:56.176 --> 00:05:57.986
Next, country where
your ad is going to run.

102
00:05:58.176 --> 00:06:00.066
I'm going to select
United States.

103
00:05:58.176 --> 00:06:00.066
I'm going to select
United States.

104
00:06:01.466 --> 00:06:05.286
Next, Ad. Ad is a combination
of Creative and Destination.

105
00:06:05.876 --> 00:06:08.456
I'm going to select
Banner for Creative

106
00:06:09.126 --> 00:06:10.366
and Destination: iTunes.

107
00:06:11.676 --> 00:06:15.136
iTunes destination refers to
the App Store product page

108
00:06:15.806 --> 00:06:18.796
where user can review
the app details

109
00:06:18.796 --> 00:06:22.176
and download the app
right from there.

110
00:06:22.306 --> 00:06:23.116
Next, flight dates.

111
00:06:24.586 --> 00:06:26.646
These are the dates during which
your campaign is going to run.

112
00:06:27.556 --> 00:06:30.446
The default started is today
and ended is a month from now.

113
00:06:30.976 --> 00:06:32.806
Let's leave it as is.

114
00:06:33.186 --> 00:06:33.826
Next, budget.

115
00:06:33.826 --> 00:06:36.166
How much money you are willing
to spend on this campaign?

116
00:06:36.166 --> 00:06:38.406
Let me enter 2,000 dollars.

117
00:06:40.096 --> 00:06:41.996
Daily Spend Goal is
automatically calculated.

118
00:06:43.786 --> 00:06:47.916
CPC Bid: how much you are
willing to pay per click,

119
00:06:48.826 --> 00:06:50.506
the maximum you're
willing to pay per click.

120
00:06:50.696 --> 00:06:54.546
You may enter 50 cents.

121
00:06:54.596 --> 00:06:56.456
Let's leave the CPA
Goal optional.

122
00:06:57.646 --> 00:07:01.496
Clicking on Calculate will
give us the estimated number

123
00:06:57.646 --> 00:07:01.496
Clicking on Calculate will
give us the estimated number

124
00:07:01.496 --> 00:07:04.726
of impressions and tabs.

125
00:07:04.726 --> 00:07:08.516
If you want to see more
impressions and tabs,

126
00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:11.526
you can change the combination
of targeting, budget,

127
00:07:11.526 --> 00:07:17.056
and bid, and you'll see more.

128
00:07:17.256 --> 00:07:18.586
Next, let's name our line.

129
00:07:19.186 --> 00:07:21.876
I've used the term "line"
several times in this page.

130
00:07:22.706 --> 00:07:23.216
What is line?

131
00:07:23.926 --> 00:07:27.576
A line is a combination of
targeting, budget, and bid.

132
00:07:27.796 --> 00:07:29.626
You can have several
lines in a campaign.

133
00:07:30.616 --> 00:07:34.626
I'm going to name this
line, My Simple Auto Line.

134
00:07:36.076 --> 00:07:39.756
Clicking on Next will take me
to the Targeting Summary page

135
00:07:40.566 --> 00:07:41.856
where all the lines are listed.

136
00:07:42.356 --> 00:07:44.436
For this campaign, we
have just one line.

137
00:07:45.136 --> 00:07:47.626
You can always add more lines by
clicking on Create Line button.

138
00:07:48.836 --> 00:07:54.226
Clicking on Next will take us to
step 3, which is Creating an Ad.

139
00:07:55.336 --> 00:07:57.846
The first choice we have
is selecting a device

140
00:07:57.846 --> 00:07:58.876
where your ad is going to run.

141
00:07:59.606 --> 00:08:02.726
Klara is a universal app,
so the system detected that

142
00:07:59.606 --> 00:08:02.726
Klara is a universal app,
so the system detected that

143
00:08:02.726 --> 00:08:05.136
and gave iPhone,
iPad on Universal.

144
00:08:05.626 --> 00:08:06.556
Let's select Universal.

145
00:08:07.716 --> 00:08:09.286
For language, let's
stick with English.

146
00:08:09.696 --> 00:08:10.916
We have more choices
there as well.

147
00:08:12.006 --> 00:08:13.796
Then let's define the creative.

148
00:08:14.276 --> 00:08:18.166
There are two choices, Using a
Template and From My Desktop.

149
00:08:18.966 --> 00:08:23.966
From My Desktop is
upload your own Banner.

150
00:08:25.396 --> 00:08:27.366
But for now, let's
select templates.

151
00:08:27.366 --> 00:08:31.276
We have built several templates
for you to make it easy.

152
00:08:32.196 --> 00:08:36.666
As you can see, there
are different formats

153
00:08:36.666 --> 00:08:37.466
for these templates.

154
00:08:38.546 --> 00:08:39.476
Let me select marigold.

155
00:08:42.126 --> 00:08:46.106
For title, let's give
the name of the app.

156
00:08:47.046 --> 00:08:50.106
And for message, few
words about your app.

157
00:08:52.956 --> 00:08:56.776
And for Call to Action, you
have several predefined ones

158
00:08:56.946 --> 00:08:58.626
or you can always
enter a custom text.

159
00:08:59.366 --> 00:09:00.486
I'm going to select
Download Now.

160
00:08:59.366 --> 00:09:00.486
I'm going to select
Download Now.

161
00:09:00.776 --> 00:09:06.526
And here is the preview of
how your Banner is going

162
00:09:06.526 --> 00:09:07.306
to look on the device.

163
00:09:08.556 --> 00:09:10.106
You can click on View All Sizes

164
00:09:10.746 --> 00:09:14.126
to see how we have prepared
this creative for iPhone, iPad,

165
00:09:14.196 --> 00:09:15.056
portrait and landscape.

166
00:09:18.896 --> 00:09:19.956
That's how simple it is.

167
00:09:21.386 --> 00:09:23.056
Let's select their
destination, iTunes.

168
00:09:23.056 --> 00:09:29.006
As you saw, as soon as I
selected the destination,

169
00:09:30.196 --> 00:09:34.886
it's pointing to the
Klara iTunes product page.

170
00:09:34.986 --> 00:09:38.056
For this ad to go live,
we need to associate this

171
00:09:38.056 --> 00:09:40.316
with the line that
we just created.

172
00:09:43.886 --> 00:09:45.056
I'm assigning to the line.

173
00:09:46.116 --> 00:09:52.476
We give that name, Marigold 1.

174
00:09:52.666 --> 00:09:55.686
Clicking on Next will take

175
00:09:56.316 --> 00:09:57.436
where you will see all the ads

176
00:09:57.476 --> 00:09:58.806
that are created

00:10:01.526 --> 00:10:03.926
And you can always
create more Ads from here

178
00:10:04.496 --> 00:10:05.566
by clicking on Create Ad.

179
00:10:06.546 --> 00:10:09.066
Clicking on Next will take us
to the Campaign Summary page

180
00:10:09.066 --> 00:10:12.946
where you can review all
the details in one place.

181
00:10:13.136 --> 00:10:13.896
Where you're promoting,

182
00:10:14.566 --> 00:10:16.946
what you're targeting,
what are your ads.

183
00:10:18.216 --> 00:10:20.856
In case you have not
set up the payment yet,

184
00:10:21.806 --> 00:10:24.636
which is a credit card,
you can always click here,

185
00:10:24.636 --> 00:10:25.816
but let's Submit.

186
00:10:25.816 --> 00:10:32.236
When you submit, the
creatives are submitted

187
00:10:32.236 --> 00:10:33.966
for iAd's Certification review.

188
00:10:34.886 --> 00:10:36.976
Once they are approved,
your campaign goes live.

189
00:10:38.716 --> 00:10:39.746
That's how simple it is.

190
00:10:40.926 --> 00:10:42.086
Back to you, Paresh.

191
00:10:42.816 --> 00:10:47.686
>> So next, let's take a deeper
dive at the tools, options,

192
00:10:47.686 --> 00:10:49.676
controls, flexibility you have

193
00:10:50.146 --> 00:10:53.596
in making advertising
work using iAd Workbench.

194
00:10:53.976 --> 00:11:02.526
We'll look at the choices you
have in choosing your audience,

195
00:10:53.976 --> 00:11:02.526
We'll look at the choices you
have in choosing your audience,

196
00:11:03.156 --> 00:11:08.326
the controls you have in
setting your price, the tools

197
00:11:08.326 --> 00:11:11.446
and options you have to create
an ad that will make an impact,

198
00:11:12.406 --> 00:11:15.366
and finally, the data
and insights you have

199
00:11:16.136 --> 00:11:18.936
to understand your campaign
performance and optimize.

200
00:11:19.666 --> 00:11:21.826
Let's start with
choosing your audience.

201
00:11:22.066 --> 00:11:26.596
Selecting the right audience
for your app or product is key.

202
00:11:27.916 --> 00:11:31.126
With iAd Workbench, we
make it very easy for you

203
00:11:31.406 --> 00:11:32.516
to define your audience.

204
00:11:33.846 --> 00:11:37.896
At the highest level,
you have two options.

205
00:11:37.896 --> 00:11:39.686
Auto and Manual.

206
00:11:40.316 --> 00:11:44.766
Auto targeting, which you saw
in the demo is the simplest

207
00:11:44.766 --> 00:11:47.726
and probably the most powerful
option we have on iAd Workbench.

208
00:11:48.816 --> 00:11:52.386
This is where iAd does all
the heavy lifting for you.

209
00:11:53.626 --> 00:11:56.656
If you want control,
you can choose Manual.

210
00:11:58.016 --> 00:12:01.396
When you choose Manual,
you'll have several options

211
00:11:58.016 --> 00:12:01.396
When you choose Manual,
you'll have several options

212
00:12:02.716 --> 00:12:03.666
to define your audience.

213
00:12:04.346 --> 00:12:07.516
On the left side, you see
simple targeting options

214
00:12:08.246 --> 00:12:12.256
like gender, age,
geo, and device.

215
00:12:13.266 --> 00:12:16.566
You can choose, for age, you
can choose specific age groups

216
00:12:16.706 --> 00:12:17.636
that you want to target.

217
00:12:18.526 --> 00:12:23.206
For geo, you can choose
or specify states and DMAs

218
00:12:23.336 --> 00:12:24.786
that you want to
target for your users.

219
00:12:26.156 --> 00:12:29.366
On the right side, there are
some very powerful options.

220
00:12:30.836 --> 00:12:35.046
Starting to the top, iTunes
Preferences is an option

221
00:12:35.416 --> 00:12:37.486
that is exclusive to iAd.

222
00:12:38.826 --> 00:12:41.036
This is where the
power of the App Store

223
00:12:41.196 --> 00:12:44.026
and the iTunes Store
comes together

224
00:12:44.186 --> 00:12:45.686
to help you find
the right audience.

225
00:12:47.176 --> 00:12:51.616
When you make a selection here,
you're basically selecting users

226
00:12:52.166 --> 00:12:57.066
who have actually downloaded
content in that category.

227
00:12:57.066 --> 00:13:01.406
So if you were to promote
a health and fitness app,

228
00:12:57.066 --> 00:13:01.406
So if you were to promote
a health and fitness app,

229
00:13:01.666 --> 00:13:05.716
wouldn't it be great if you
could choose the audience

230
00:13:05.986 --> 00:13:08.406
who like to download
health and fitness apps,

231
00:13:09.526 --> 00:13:12.696
or who like to download
fitness and workout music.

232
00:13:13.876 --> 00:13:15.856
With iAd Workbench,
you can do that.

233
00:13:16.886 --> 00:13:17.776
It's very powerful.

234
00:13:19.116 --> 00:13:22.206
The next three options
lets you define

235
00:13:22.686 --> 00:13:24.766
where your ad wants-where
you want to show your ad,

236
00:13:25.116 --> 00:13:26.206
which is App Channels.

237
00:13:27.726 --> 00:13:30.336
When you want to show
your ad, that's scheduling

238
00:13:31.146 --> 00:13:34.546
and how often do you want to
show an ad to a particular user,

239
00:13:35.026 --> 00:13:36.076
which is frequency capping.

240
00:13:37.476 --> 00:13:40.046
You can mix and match
any of these options

241
00:13:40.886 --> 00:13:43.816
to define the right
audience for your campaign.

242
00:13:45.996 --> 00:13:48.586
Next, let's look at the
flexibility you have

243
00:13:48.636 --> 00:13:49.606
in setting your price.

244
00:13:50.306 --> 00:13:55.046
With iAd Workbench, you
can choose how you want

245
00:13:55.046 --> 00:13:56.236
to pay for your campaign.

246
00:13:57.736 --> 00:14:00.606
If you want to pay for every
click, you can choose CPC.

247
00:13:57.736 --> 00:14:00.606
If you want to pay for every
click, you can choose CPC.

248
00:14:00.606 --> 00:14:03.806
If you want to pay for
every thousand impressions,

249
00:14:04.486 --> 00:14:05.676
you can choose CPM.

250
00:14:06.896 --> 00:14:10.416
The bid you enter is the
maximum you're willing to pay

251
00:14:10.936 --> 00:14:12.006
when you win the auction.

252
00:14:13.306 --> 00:14:16.086
iAd Workbench is a
bidded marketplace.

253
00:14:16.996 --> 00:14:20.286
And on this platform, you
have the peace of mind to know

254
00:14:21.276 --> 00:14:27.106
that you only pay a penny more
than the next highest bidder.

255
00:14:27.286 --> 00:14:30.616
Now let's look at the options
you have in creating your ad.

256
00:14:31.446 --> 00:14:33.256
There are a range
of options you have

257
00:14:33.636 --> 00:14:35.066
when it comes to
selecting your ad.

258
00:14:35.526 --> 00:14:40.876
You can have Banner Ads, Video
Ads, which are also known

259
00:14:40.876 --> 00:14:45.246
as pre-roll, and Rich-Media Ads
if you want higher engagement

260
00:14:45.246 --> 00:14:50.786
of the users with your ads.

261
00:14:51.006 --> 00:14:54.426
Banner ads provide a
direct path to action.

262
00:14:55.336 --> 00:14:58.016
Upon tap of a banner, you
can take a user directly

263
00:14:58.046 --> 00:15:01.016
to an iTunes product page
or to a mobile website.

264
00:14:58.046 --> 00:15:01.016
to an iTunes product page
or to a mobile website.

265
00:15:02.156 --> 00:15:04.816
Upon tap of a banner,
you can also take a user

266
00:15:05.596 --> 00:15:10.146
and show them a video and then
take them to iTunes product page

267
00:15:10.246 --> 00:15:11.386
or to a mobile website.

268
00:15:11.786 --> 00:15:16.706
Let's take a look as an example
how a banner ad looks like.

269
00:15:17.676 --> 00:15:21.456
Here's an app, you see the
ad will render at the bottom.

270
00:15:21.976 --> 00:15:25.416
After a few seconds,
the ad will refresh,

271
00:15:27.336 --> 00:15:28.916
the user engages with the ad.

272
00:15:28.916 --> 00:15:33.316
And when the user clicks on it,

273
00:15:33.776 --> 00:15:35.066
the user is taken
to the App Store.

274
00:15:36.076 --> 00:15:38.266
The user can download
the app at this point.

275
00:15:39.376 --> 00:15:42.036
Now once the user
downloads the app,

276
00:15:43.026 --> 00:15:46.916
you don't show the same
download ad again to this user,

277
00:15:47.826 --> 00:15:52.646
which means you don't waste your
money showing your ads to users

278
00:15:53.916 --> 00:15:55.466
who already have your app.

279
00:15:57.446 --> 00:15:58.696
Next is Video ads.

280
00:15:59.836 --> 00:16:03.406
Video ads play automatically
before a video content.

281
00:15:59.836 --> 00:16:03.406
Video ads play automatically
before a video content.

282
00:16:04.196 --> 00:16:05.866
They play directly
in fullscreen mode.

283
00:16:06.446 --> 00:16:10.196
With video ads, you can also
have an optional call to action

284
00:16:10.756 --> 00:16:11.836
which will take the user

285
00:16:11.836 --> 00:16:14.896
to an iTunes product
page or a mobile website.

286
00:16:15.936 --> 00:16:17.606
Here's an example of a video ad.

287
00:16:17.606 --> 00:16:19.196
>> [Background Music]
You can chase light,

288
00:16:19.196 --> 00:16:22.316
or let the light chase you.

289
00:16:22.316 --> 00:16:23.776
Introducing LightRight,

290
00:16:23.776 --> 00:16:26.896
an iOS bookmarking
tool for natural light.

291
00:16:26.896 --> 00:16:34.626
LightRight for iPhone, now
available in the App Store.

292
00:16:34.626 --> 00:16:36.376
>> As you noticed, there
was a Learn More link

293
00:16:36.376 --> 00:16:37.496
at the bottom of that video.

294
00:16:37.956 --> 00:16:41.686
The user clicks on that Learn
More link and the user is taken

295
00:16:41.686 --> 00:16:42.676
to the iTunes product page.

296
00:16:42.676 --> 00:16:45.036
You can also have the user
go to a mobile website.

297
00:16:45.736 --> 00:16:51.276
If you want to create rich-media
ads for more higher engagement,

298
00:16:51.876 --> 00:16:53.906
you can do that using
iAd Workbench as well.

299
00:16:55.226 --> 00:16:57.976
Upon tap of a banner, you
can immerse your users

300
00:16:59.086 --> 00:17:01.676
into a very custom product
or brand experience.

301
00:16:59.086 --> 00:17:01.676
into a very custom product
or brand experience.

302
00:17:02.716 --> 00:17:06.046
You can choose any combination
of features and any combination

303
00:17:06.046 --> 00:17:08.386
of call to actions to
create a rich-media ad.

304
00:17:09.116 --> 00:17:10.356
I'll show you an example

305
00:17:11.366 --> 00:17:14.586
that the client had actually
used really good features

306
00:17:14.705 --> 00:17:16.376
to create a great experience.

307
00:17:17.165 --> 00:17:17.675
Let's take a look.

308
00:17:17.675 --> 00:17:19.326
Here's the app.

309
00:17:19.576 --> 00:17:22.756
You see the ad being rendered.

310
00:17:24.026 --> 00:17:27.056
The user taps on the ad,
and is taken-is immersed

311
00:17:27.056 --> 00:17:28.185
into a brand experience.

312
00:17:29.666 --> 00:17:32.056
The user can browse through
the pictures gallery.

313
00:17:35.496 --> 00:17:39.776
The user is still
within the app.

314
00:17:40.036 --> 00:17:41.566
You can take the
user to Facebook

315
00:17:41.926 --> 00:17:43.486
so you can have a
Facebook integration.

316
00:17:43.816 --> 00:17:46.206
You can have the user like
your page on Facebook.

317
00:17:46.506 --> 00:17:52.906
You can have the reservations
module within the ad.

318
00:17:53.146 --> 00:17:55.916
And finally, you can even
integrate the app download right

319
00:17:55.916 --> 00:17:58.176
from this place.

320
00:17:58.276 --> 00:18:01.016
So as you see, you
can do a lot of things

321
00:17:58.276 --> 00:18:01.016
So as you see, you
can do a lot of things

322
00:18:01.016 --> 00:18:02.226
when it comes to rich-media ads.

323
00:18:02.766 --> 00:18:08.126
Now that awesome ad was
created using a free tool

324
00:18:08.126 --> 00:18:12.606
that is available to everyone
which is called iAd Producer.

325
00:18:12.606 --> 00:18:19.196
With iAd Producer, you can
create highly interactive

326
00:18:19.196 --> 00:18:19.846
rich-media ads.

327
00:18:21.126 --> 00:18:24.266
They made it so easy for
you that you can just drag

328
00:18:24.266 --> 00:18:26.916
and drop your assets
in a visual layout.

329
00:18:27.536 --> 00:18:29.056
Or you can customize
the visual layout.

330
00:18:29.496 --> 00:18:35.526
We provide you with an extensive
library of over 500 blueprints

331
00:18:36.286 --> 00:18:37.156
which are like templates.

332
00:18:37.846 --> 00:18:39.516
And when you use one
of these blueprints,

333
00:18:39.966 --> 00:18:42.466
they come with built-in
performance and analytics

334
00:18:42.606 --> 00:18:46.166
so you can see how your user
is engaging and interacting

335
00:18:46.456 --> 00:18:47.996
with the rich-media ad.

336
00:18:48.816 --> 00:18:51.436
And finally, with
iAd Producer 4.2

337
00:18:51.716 --> 00:18:53.786
that was introduced
just two weeks ago,

338
00:18:53.826 --> 00:19:00.156
you have integrated iAd Producer
with Workbench, which means,

339
00:18:53.826 --> 00:19:00.156
you have integrated iAd Producer
with Workbench, which means,

340
00:19:00.776 --> 00:19:02.656
if you create an ad
using iAd Producer,

341
00:19:03.166 --> 00:19:06.466
you can now upload it
directly on to Workbench.

342
00:19:07.446 --> 00:19:12.516
And when you go to Workbench,
you'll have it available to use.

343
00:19:14.856 --> 00:19:16.516
So once you create
your campaign,

344
00:19:17.036 --> 00:19:20.326
your campaign is
running and you want

345
00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:21.906
to see how the campaign
is performing.

346
00:19:22.366 --> 00:19:26.126
When it comes to
campaign performance,

347
00:19:26.236 --> 00:19:28.866
we provide you rich analytics

348
00:19:29.476 --> 00:19:31.556
that helps you understand
how your campaign is doing

349
00:19:31.556 --> 00:19:33.046
so you can take the
right actions.

350
00:19:33.536 --> 00:19:36.556
We give you data,
performance metrics,

351
00:19:36.556 --> 00:19:38.946
as well as conversion metrics
which includes, you know,

352
00:19:38.946 --> 00:19:40.906
what your spend is,
your capture rate is,

353
00:19:41.146 --> 00:19:44.556
number of impressions you
got, as well as the downloads

354
00:19:44.556 --> 00:19:47.946
that you've received so
you can tune your campaign.

355
00:19:49.326 --> 00:19:51.236
We provide you this
data at every level

356
00:19:52.586 --> 00:19:55.366
at the aggregate
campaign level as well

357
00:19:55.366 --> 00:19:59.966
as at lower line and ad levels.

358
00:20:00.046 --> 00:20:03.936
You can also download this
data as a .CSV file from any

359
00:20:03.936 --> 00:20:04.876
of the analytic screens.

360
00:20:05.396 --> 00:20:10.256
So, at this point, I'll ask
Ravi to walk us through some

361
00:20:10.256 --> 00:20:11.676
of these tools and
options that we talked

362
00:20:11.676 --> 00:20:13.766
about to make your
advertising work.

363
00:20:14.916 --> 00:20:15.796
>> Thank you, Paresh.

364
00:20:15.796 --> 00:20:22.926
In this demo, I'm going
to walk you through some

365
00:20:22.926 --> 00:20:24.926
of the core concepts that
Paresh has mentioned,

366
00:20:25.826 --> 00:20:29.596
touch and targeting, some of
the new ad formats analytics.

367
00:20:30.206 --> 00:20:31.886
Let's get started.

368
00:20:32.966 --> 00:20:35.936
I've been working on a
campaign I'm halfway through it,

369
00:20:37.146 --> 00:20:39.056
let's finish this
campaign together.

370
00:20:42.686 --> 00:20:46.086
I created a campaign and
created just one line

371
00:20:47.506 --> 00:20:50.376
with a manual targeting
and I want

372
00:20:50.376 --> 00:20:52.116
to finish-show you
what targeting I've set

373
00:20:52.116 --> 00:20:57.416
up by editing the
line and later,

374
00:20:57.416 --> 00:20:59.896
we'll add ads to this one.

375
00:21:00.446 --> 00:21:10.146
A targeting option, we're going
to select as Manual and this-and

376
00:21:10.146 --> 00:21:12.576
for the country, let's
leave it as United States.

377
00:21:12.696 --> 00:21:17.026
And these are the
different targeting options

378
00:21:17.246 --> 00:21:18.186
that we have available.

379
00:21:20.636 --> 00:21:23.256
You can see all the options
on the left-hand side.

380
00:21:23.956 --> 00:21:26.566
On the right, you will see the
options that we have selected.

381
00:21:26.566 --> 00:21:28.176
By default, it's All.

382
00:21:30.516 --> 00:21:35.936
Next, I'm going to target
few of the app references.

383
00:21:36.556 --> 00:21:43.886
I'm going to select Lifestyle,
Photo and Video and Travel.

384
00:21:46.246 --> 00:21:48.896
Then for App Channels, I
want to do similar thing.

385
00:21:50.776 --> 00:21:51.946
I'm going to do Lifestyle,

386
00:21:52.126 --> 00:21:56.946
I'm going to do Photo
and Video and Travel.

387
00:21:58.746 --> 00:22:02.076
You can always select
more based upon,

388
00:21:58.746 --> 00:22:02.076
You can always select
more based upon,

389
00:22:02.076 --> 00:22:03.066
you know, how it's performing.

390
00:22:04.426 --> 00:22:08.486
For app type, last time we
did for creative: banner.

391
00:22:09.906 --> 00:22:12.026
This time we're going to
do video as a creative

392
00:22:13.356 --> 00:22:14.716
to a website as a destination.

393
00:22:15.746 --> 00:22:17.666
My goal here is to drive
traffic to the website.

394
00:22:17.666 --> 00:22:23.706
And for flight dates,
let's leave it as a default

395
00:22:23.706 --> 00:22:27.226
and I've given some
spend, budget and bid here.

396
00:22:27.226 --> 00:22:35.076
Let's go to the next step
where we can create an ad.

397
00:22:36.936 --> 00:22:39.726
Here we have two choices,
a banner or a video.

398
00:22:39.726 --> 00:22:41.776
Let's select video.

399
00:22:41.776 --> 00:22:48.486
And where your ad-you want
your ad to run for devices

400
00:22:48.486 --> 00:22:50.746
for maximum reach,
let's pick Universal.

401
00:22:52.006 --> 00:22:54.926
For language, let's
keep it at English.

402
00:22:56.236 --> 00:22:59.556
And here we are at a step where
we need to upload a video file.

403
00:22:59.556 --> 00:23:05.436
iAd Workbench supports
two formats

404
00:22:59.556 --> 00:23:05.436
iAd Workbench supports
two formats

405
00:23:05.436 --> 00:23:09.216
for the video file,
.M4V and .MOV.

406
00:23:09.406 --> 00:23:11.156
There are few more
specs here right here.

407
00:23:12.616 --> 00:23:14.586
We encourage you to follow
the specs so you don't trip

408
00:23:14.586 --> 00:23:15.666
on any validation errors.

409
00:23:16.146 --> 00:23:17.656
Let's upload.

410
00:23:22.856 --> 00:23:24.936
The file is being
uploaded from my laptop

411
00:23:25.266 --> 00:23:28.556
to the Workbench
servers right now.

412
00:23:28.626 --> 00:23:30.156
Once the file reaches
the servers,

413
00:23:30.786 --> 00:23:34.006
the file will be transcoded
to multiple formats

414
00:23:35.336 --> 00:23:37.336
to suit the devices
and resolutions

415
00:23:37.876 --> 00:23:41.836
like iPhone high res, low res,
iPad high res and low res.

416
00:23:43.626 --> 00:23:44.656
It's uploading right now.

417
00:23:48.906 --> 00:23:50.386
Let it take its time.

418
00:23:53.166 --> 00:23:55.556
I guess everybody is using
the network bandwidth I guess.

419
00:23:57.026 --> 00:23:58.876
So, right now it seems like
the file has reached the server

420
00:23:58.876 --> 00:24:00.926
as you saw the status
changed to Formatting.

421
00:23:58.876 --> 00:24:00.926
as you saw the status
changed to Formatting.

422
00:24:02.686 --> 00:24:04.886
This is when the video
transcoding is happening.

423
00:24:06.306 --> 00:24:09.026
It's actually transforming the
video to suit the other devices.

424
00:24:09.126 --> 00:24:12.536
Let's take a quick review.

425
00:24:17.666 --> 00:24:19.776
>> [Background Music]
You can chase light

426
00:24:19.776 --> 00:24:22.906
or let the light chase you.

427
00:24:22.906 --> 00:24:24.356
Introducing LightRight,

428
00:24:24.356 --> 00:24:27.676
an iOS bookmarking
tool for natural light.

429
00:24:27.676 --> 00:24:37.796
LightRight for iPhone, now
available from the App Store.

430
00:24:37.796 --> 00:24:38.536
>> That was a cool video.

431
00:24:38.896 --> 00:24:42.056
I just want to highlight
one thing here.

432
00:24:42.996 --> 00:24:48.446
For you as an advertiser,
prepare one file

433
00:24:48.446 --> 00:24:52.056
to one technical
specification and be assured

434
00:24:52.056 --> 00:24:57.746
that your ad-video ad is going
to run on all the Apple devices

435
00:24:58.276 --> 00:25:06.136
in the best way possible,
so, that's how simple it is

436
00:24:58.276 --> 00:25:06.136
in the best way possible,
so, that's how simple it is

437
00:25:06.136 --> 00:25:10.806
to create a video ad here.

438
00:25:10.976 --> 00:25:15.466
Use this ad format, we encourage
you to take advantage of it.

439
00:25:15.716 --> 00:25:16.776
Let's select the destination.

440
00:25:17.206 --> 00:25:19.916
As I said I'm going
to the website.

441
00:25:20.646 --> 00:25:23.076
You can view the URL right here.

442
00:25:29.466 --> 00:25:33.356
And then it will ask you for
the destination, for the name.

443
00:25:34.246 --> 00:25:35.706
I like the name LightRight
website here.

444
00:25:35.706 --> 00:25:38.276
So I'm going to leave it as is.

445
00:25:38.406 --> 00:25:40.776
For this app to go live, you
need to assign to the line.

446
00:25:41.176 --> 00:25:43.316
I'm going to assign to the video
line that I created earlier.

447
00:25:46.976 --> 00:25:47.986
Let's name the ad.

448
00:25:49.086 --> 00:25:51.476
I'm going to name it
as My Awesome Video.

449
00:25:57.886 --> 00:26:00.446
Clicking on Next will take
us to the Ad Summary page.

450
00:25:57.886 --> 00:26:00.446
Clicking on Next will take
us to the Ad Summary page.

451
00:26:02.446 --> 00:26:07.456
So, that's the demo of the
powerful ad format video ad.

452
00:26:09.126 --> 00:26:14.676
So far in my two
demos, we mainly focused

453
00:26:14.676 --> 00:26:17.276
on creating a campaign,
on editing a campaign,

454
00:26:17.866 --> 00:26:19.926
focused on a little bit on
targeting and ad formats.

455
00:26:21.096 --> 00:26:24.146
Once a campaign is
created, the next thing

456
00:26:24.146 --> 00:26:27.686
to focus is monitoring the
performance of the campaign

457
00:26:28.566 --> 00:26:33.136
to ensure that it is going
towards the goal you have set

458
00:26:33.136 --> 00:26:33.526
out for.

459
00:26:37.346 --> 00:26:39.306
In order to monitor the
performance of the campaign,

460
00:26:40.286 --> 00:26:41.206
we have some analytics.

461
00:26:42.576 --> 00:26:44.846
So, next, I want you to
take-I want to take you

462
00:26:44.846 --> 00:26:45.846
to the analytics pages.

463
00:26:48.836 --> 00:26:51.626
I have these two campaigns
that have been running

464
00:26:51.626 --> 00:26:54.066
for the last 6 months.

465
00:26:54.066 --> 00:26:56.886
I want to show the
performance of these campaigns.

466
00:26:57.086 --> 00:27:01.406
As you see the Dashboard
used the basic metrics spend,

467
00:26:57.086 --> 00:27:01.406
As you see the Dashboard
used the basic metrics spend,

468
00:27:01.846 --> 00:27:04.486
impressions, TTR
and conversions.

469
00:27:04.986 --> 00:27:09.386
You can click on any of these
metrics and go into the details.

470
00:27:12.396 --> 00:27:14.556
By default, it gives
Since Campaign Start

471
00:27:14.816 --> 00:27:20.426
and you have different custom
data groups you can select

472
00:27:20.426 --> 00:27:21.356
that we have prepared for you.

473
00:27:21.916 --> 00:27:23.146
Let me select last 30 days.

474
00:27:26.616 --> 00:27:29.076
That's the spend for the last
30 days for this campaign.

475
00:27:30.506 --> 00:27:32.456
Seems like we are spending
more in the weekends

476
00:27:32.626 --> 00:27:34.786
and spend is coming down
during the weekdays.

477
00:27:35.386 --> 00:27:38.986
You have different
metrics that you can view.

478
00:27:39.446 --> 00:27:40.166
I've listed here.

479
00:27:40.166 --> 00:27:48.276
And you can overlay any
metric on top of it.

480
00:27:48.496 --> 00:27:50.746
Or if you want to compare
how you've been spending,

481
00:27:51.836 --> 00:27:53.056
compare to the previous period,

482
00:27:53.586 --> 00:27:56.316
you can always select
Compare with Previous Period.

483
00:27:57.256 --> 00:28:01.496
That gives you how the last 30
days is performing as opposed

484
00:27:57.256 --> 00:28:01.496
That gives you how the last 30
days is performing as opposed

485
00:28:01.496 --> 00:28:06.296
to the previous 30 days.

486
00:28:06.326 --> 00:28:08.246
Overlay is a pretty neat feature

487
00:28:08.246 --> 00:28:17.166
where you can overlay any metric
here and compare to the spend.

488
00:28:17.166 --> 00:28:18.596
I ordered average CPA metric.

489
00:28:19.316 --> 00:28:22.226
It seems like we are doing less

490
00:28:22.226 --> 00:28:23.646
than 2 dollars for
download here.

491
00:28:27.336 --> 00:28:28.286
Let's go into the lines.

492
00:28:30.916 --> 00:28:32.906
By default, it gives you
the cumulative number.

493
00:28:34.116 --> 00:28:36.936
You can always select
Time, Time Series graph

494
00:28:37.186 --> 00:28:38.376
to see how the lines
are performing.

495
00:28:38.936 --> 00:28:42.116
It seems like we are spending
more on this line than this one.

496
00:28:42.316 --> 00:28:50.026
And you can do similar
analysis on ad side as well.

497
00:28:50.186 --> 00:28:53.066
By default, it gives you
the spend for cumulative.

498
00:28:53.156 --> 00:28:56.466
You can always change
the metrics and change

499
00:28:56.466 --> 00:28:57.566
to the time series graph.

500
00:28:58.866 --> 00:29:00.626
We're pretty close on
these two ads here.

501
00:28:58.866 --> 00:29:00.626
We're pretty close on
these two ads here.

502
00:29:00.626 --> 00:29:04.786
Let me go back to
the summary and find

503
00:29:04.786 --> 00:29:05.686
out a couple of things here.

504
00:29:06.356 --> 00:29:08.886
You can easily toggle between
a graph and a table view

505
00:29:09.296 --> 00:29:10.156
if you choose to do so.

506
00:29:12.906 --> 00:29:16.536
Or if you can scroll down and
you can click on Download CSV

507
00:29:16.536 --> 00:29:22.136
to get a file onto your
desktop and do offline analysis.

508
00:29:22.816 --> 00:29:25.676
And Download CSV is available
across the board on Dashboard

509
00:29:26.096 --> 00:29:28.946
on every analytic
space that we have.

510
00:29:32.636 --> 00:29:35.176
So, that's a quick
overview of, you know,

511
00:29:35.176 --> 00:29:37.576
how to measure the
performance of your campaign.

512
00:29:39.276 --> 00:29:42.056
All the data that I've been
showing in last 5 minutes,

513
00:29:42.596 --> 00:29:44.376
that data is available
through the API.

514
00:29:45.896 --> 00:29:48.346
So, next, I'm going to drop you
through the complete overview

515
00:29:48.346 --> 00:29:51.216
of iAd Workbench API that
we have released this year.

516
00:29:52.366 --> 00:29:54.966
So, your-you are an advertiser.

517
00:29:55.406 --> 00:29:57.586
You have created
multiple campaigns

518
00:29:58.286 --> 00:30:00.336
and managing all
those campaigns.

519
00:29:58.286 --> 00:30:00.336
and managing all
those campaigns.

520
00:30:01.336 --> 00:30:03.756
And you want to scale
beyond the web interface.

521
00:30:05.556 --> 00:30:06.696
API is for you.

522
00:30:08.056 --> 00:30:11.076
Say you're an advertiser who
wanted to get the metrics

523
00:30:11.256 --> 00:30:14.216
and incorporate it to
your own dashboards.

524
00:30:15.516 --> 00:30:16.356
API is for you.

525
00:30:17.766 --> 00:30:19.586
Let's get into the-more details.

526
00:30:20.846 --> 00:30:22.456
You can also use it
for bulk operations.

527
00:30:26.316 --> 00:30:29.176
API has two broad categories.

528
00:30:31.486 --> 00:30:37.576
Reporting, where you can get the
metrics and perform the offline

529
00:30:37.576 --> 00:30:38.636
and real-time analysis.

530
00:30:39.056 --> 00:30:42.966
What do I mean by
real-time analysis here?

531
00:30:43.176 --> 00:30:45.406
You can write a program for
example that runs at the top

532
00:30:45.406 --> 00:30:50.446
of every hour, get some
metrics, analyze the data

533
00:30:50.616 --> 00:30:53.296
and modify your campaign data.

534
00:30:53.296 --> 00:30:57.426
You can trace the bid, start
and stop a campaign ad.

535
00:30:58.726 --> 00:31:00.456
That's what I'm talking
about real-time analysis.

536
00:30:58.726 --> 00:31:00.456
That's what I'm talking
about real-time analysis.

537
00:31:00.886 --> 00:31:04.296
For offline analysis, you
can do your own dashboards.

538
00:31:04.456 --> 00:31:11.196
And campaign management, you
can get the campaign details,

539
00:31:11.526 --> 00:31:13.956
update the critical
campaign data and start

540
00:31:13.956 --> 00:31:15.926
and stop campaign lines or ads.

541
00:31:19.336 --> 00:31:20.996
Let's get into some very basics.

542
00:31:20.996 --> 00:31:22.256
We're talking about API here.

543
00:31:23.946 --> 00:31:29.876
For communication, API
uses JSON or HTTPS.

544
00:31:29.876 --> 00:31:33.326
We want to keep the data
protocol pretty simple

545
00:31:33.326 --> 00:31:35.896
so it's easy to understand
and it's easy to test.

546
00:31:36.396 --> 00:31:41.266
We use JSON for data protocol
and secure HTTPS for security.

547
00:31:41.856 --> 00:31:50.306
The next: authentication, we use
client certificates, private key

548
00:31:50.306 --> 00:31:55.106
and access token as a
combination for authentication,

549
00:31:55.106 --> 00:31:56.776
making it a very
strong authentication.

550
00:31:57.286 --> 00:32:02.616
And for key management, we want
to make it as easy as possible

551
00:31:57.286 --> 00:32:02.616
And for key management, we want
to make it as easy as possible

552
00:32:03.616 --> 00:32:05.896
so you can be having
web interface

553
00:32:05.896 --> 00:32:08.086
for that on Workbench app.

554
00:32:12.196 --> 00:32:13.466
So, how do you initiate
this API?

555
00:32:13.466 --> 00:32:17.826
We have three basic
steps: download keys,

556
00:32:18.096 --> 00:32:19.676
verify keys and integrate.

557
00:32:20.166 --> 00:32:25.886
Go to Workbench,
go to the API page,

558
00:32:26.486 --> 00:32:29.126
click on the Download
link to download the keys.

559
00:32:30.306 --> 00:32:32.696
When you download the keys,
we give you a .zip file

560
00:32:32.696 --> 00:32:34.446
that has keys and
sample programs.

561
00:32:34.576 --> 00:32:39.826
And sample programs are
already embedded with your keys.

562
00:32:40.026 --> 00:32:42.616
Run those sample programs
and verify the keys.

563
00:32:43.106 --> 00:32:47.686
And then download the
API programming guide,

564
00:32:49.966 --> 00:32:53.096
write your own programs,
deploy them on your servers

565
00:32:53.146 --> 00:32:56.196
and integrate, that's
how simple it is.

566
00:32:57.946 --> 00:33:00.296
Let me quickly walk you through
some of the core methods here.

567
00:32:57.946 --> 00:33:00.296
Let me quickly walk you through
some of the core methods here.

568
00:33:00.776 --> 00:33:05.996
We have InitSession for session
initialization, which is key

569
00:33:06.436 --> 00:33:08.506
because you need to pass the
sessionId for every method

570
00:33:08.506 --> 00:33:11.476
that you are going to call
in your program for API.

571
00:33:12.766 --> 00:33:18.106
Campaign method-metadata methods
to get the campaign details,

572
00:33:18.216 --> 00:33:20.226
reporting API to
get the metrics.

573
00:33:20.226 --> 00:33:26.626
And campaign management
API to update the details

574
00:33:26.626 --> 00:33:32.446
as well as start and stop.

575
00:33:32.566 --> 00:33:33.856
Now, I'm going to
walk you through some

576
00:33:33.856 --> 00:33:36.926
of the sample program that
I've already done using the

577
00:33:36.926 --> 00:33:39.136
highlighted methods
here, InitSession,

578
00:33:39.626 --> 00:33:45.746
GetCampaignDetails
and UpdateLine.

579
00:33:45.746 --> 00:33:49.836
So, here is a sample program,
sample method where I'm trying

580
00:33:49.836 --> 00:33:53.666
to pass access token,
prepare the request tab,

581
00:33:55.596 --> 00:34:00.386
post it to the server
then get the response back

582
00:33:55.596 --> 00:34:00.386
post it to the server
then get the response back

583
00:34:00.386 --> 00:34:03.646
and read the session from that,
sessionId from the response.

584
00:34:03.916 --> 00:34:08.786
Once I get the sessionId,
I pass the sessionId

585
00:34:09.516 --> 00:34:14.826
to getCampaignDetails method,
get the campaign IDs and filter

586
00:34:14.826 --> 00:34:18.246
by running state, post
that to the server,

587
00:34:18.246 --> 00:34:20.646
get the response back.

588
00:34:22.386 --> 00:34:27.686
Next, for the campaign details
I got, I'm passing the LineId

589
00:34:27.686 --> 00:34:29.005
for which I want to
increase the bid.

590
00:34:29.936 --> 00:34:33.426
So I gave the line-SessionId,
LineId and the CPMBid,

591
00:34:37.016 --> 00:34:40.096
post to server, and
get the response back.

592
00:34:41.666 --> 00:34:44.275
That's how simple it is
to write the programs

593
00:34:44.275 --> 00:34:49.206
to communicate with the API.

594
00:34:49.426 --> 00:34:55.545
Powerful, secure and easy
to use, go try it out.

595
00:34:56.146 --> 00:35:00.746
With this, I'm going to
pass on to Paresh to walk us

596
00:34:56.146 --> 00:35:00.746
With this, I'm going to
pass on to Paresh to walk us

597
00:35:00.746 --> 00:35:02.026
through what's coming next.

598
00:35:02.916 --> 00:35:03.486
There you go Paresh.

599
00:35:04.916 --> 00:35:05.496
>> Thank you, Ravi.

600
00:35:05.786 --> 00:35:08.286
It's fascinating what
you can do with the APIs

601
00:35:08.626 --> 00:35:10.816
and how you can make bulk
changes to your campaigns

602
00:35:10.996 --> 00:35:12.176
from your own user interface.

603
00:35:12.816 --> 00:35:17.506
So, what's coming this fall?

604
00:35:17.706 --> 00:35:21.146
So far, we've talked about
how iAd Workbench can help you

605
00:35:21.146 --> 00:35:22.706
acquire new customers.

606
00:35:24.026 --> 00:35:25.556
But that's just half the battle.

607
00:35:26.356 --> 00:35:30.566
For you to grow your business,
you also need to re-engage

608
00:35:30.566 --> 00:35:34.586
with your existing customers
and have them do more

609
00:35:34.586 --> 00:35:39.566
of what you want, whether it's
spending more time in your app,

610
00:35:39.856 --> 00:35:42.966
buying more of your products,
or even trying your new apps.

611
00:35:43.616 --> 00:35:47.116
I came across a study
recently on the web

612
00:35:48.086 --> 00:35:49.866
by a mobile analytics
firm, Localytics,

613
00:35:50.836 --> 00:35:53.196
which said 22 percent
of the apps

614
00:35:53.196 --> 00:35:58.286
that were downloaded were used
only once and over 60 percent

615
00:35:58.286 --> 00:36:01.416
of them were used
less than 10 times.

616
00:35:58.286 --> 00:36:01.416
of them were used
less than 10 times.

617
00:36:02.916 --> 00:36:05.516
Now, you want users
to frequently engage

618
00:36:05.516 --> 00:36:07.346
with your app or your website.

619
00:36:07.796 --> 00:36:11.766
Let's take a few examples
how engaged-re-engaging

620
00:36:11.766 --> 00:36:14.076
with your customers can
help you grow your business.

621
00:36:16.846 --> 00:36:19.816
First example is
about a game app.

622
00:36:20.706 --> 00:36:26.536
So you came up with a new iPad
version of your iPhone game.

623
00:36:26.736 --> 00:36:32.326
Now, who will be the best
customers for this new app?

624
00:36:33.496 --> 00:36:37.156
Of course, the users who
use that game on the iPhone.

625
00:36:37.156 --> 00:36:44.296
What if you had a way to
connect with these customers

626
00:36:45.326 --> 00:36:48.056
and inform them about
your new game?

627
00:36:48.506 --> 00:36:52.126
And what if you could inform
them about this new game

628
00:36:52.766 --> 00:36:56.966
when they are on their iPad?

629
00:36:57.106 --> 00:36:59.296
Or, say you enhanced your app

630
00:36:59.296 --> 00:37:01.466
and you added more
levels more game levels

631
00:36:59.296 --> 00:37:01.466
and you added more
levels more game levels

632
00:37:01.546 --> 00:37:05.886
or you have more things that
you want to sell in your app.

633
00:37:06.156 --> 00:37:10.636
What if you had a way to
re-engage with the users

634
00:37:11.166 --> 00:37:17.196
and show or promote these
levels only to users

635
00:37:17.196 --> 00:37:20.416
who have reached certain
levels in your game

636
00:37:20.596 --> 00:37:23.436
or show this merchandise
only to users

637
00:37:23.436 --> 00:37:28.086
who actually buy
merchandise like this?

638
00:37:28.136 --> 00:37:32.796
And what about all those
users who downloaded your app

639
00:37:33.416 --> 00:37:37.386
but haven't used it
in the last two weeks?

640
00:37:37.516 --> 00:37:40.496
What if you had a way
to reconnect with them

641
00:37:41.356 --> 00:37:45.496
and motivate them to try-come
back and try your app again?

642
00:37:46.496 --> 00:37:47.936
And what if you could
connect with them

643
00:37:48.016 --> 00:37:49.046
when they're not in your app?

644
00:37:49.616 --> 00:37:51.756
Let's take another example.

645
00:37:52.256 --> 00:37:55.446
A retail app.

646
00:37:55.446 --> 00:37:57.026
Say you have a retail app.

647
00:37:57.336 --> 00:38:00.576
Now, you have users who browse
through your product catalog

648
00:37:57.336 --> 00:38:00.576
Now, you have users who browse
through your product catalog

649
00:38:01.346 --> 00:38:03.206
and add things to
the shopping basket.

650
00:38:04.106 --> 00:38:08.896
Many of these users exit the
app before they actually make

651
00:38:09.666 --> 00:38:10.706
a purchase.

652
00:38:10.836 --> 00:38:16.416
What if you had a way to find
these users and bring them back

653
00:38:16.696 --> 00:38:19.126
to finish the purchase and what

654
00:38:19.126 --> 00:38:22.266
if you could bring them
back exactly at the point

655
00:38:22.266 --> 00:38:24.326
where they had left
in the shopping basket

656
00:38:25.296 --> 00:38:27.766
so they can finish the
transaction in next step.

657
00:38:28.116 --> 00:38:33.776
And if you want to send offers
to your loyal customers,

658
00:38:34.976 --> 00:38:36.416
what if you could
show these offers

659
00:38:36.416 --> 00:38:38.496
to your loyal customers
irrespective

660
00:38:38.496 --> 00:38:40.616
of what iOS device they are on?

661
00:38:41.086 --> 00:38:47.066
And for users and your
customers who have items

662
00:38:47.066 --> 00:38:50.326
in their wish list, what if
you could reconnect with these

663
00:38:51.436 --> 00:38:54.436
and inform them when the items
on the wish list are on sale?

664
00:38:54.436 --> 00:38:59.626
Now, in each of these
examples that we talked about,

665
00:38:59.826 --> 00:39:02.086
we talked about reconnecting

666
00:38:59.826 --> 00:39:02.086
we talked about reconnecting

667
00:39:02.086 --> 00:39:03.856
with a specific group
of audience.

668
00:39:05.396 --> 00:39:08.486
Whether it's all the customers
who have downloaded your app

669
00:39:09.166 --> 00:39:12.896
or the dormant users who
haven't used your app,

670
00:39:12.976 --> 00:39:17.936
or the loyal users who do
purchases for you, or the users

671
00:39:18.056 --> 00:39:22.186
who have an abandoned cart
on your shopping-on your app.

672
00:39:22.406 --> 00:39:28.696
We call this group of
audiences as "segments".

673
00:39:29.426 --> 00:39:32.976
Now there are probably
a million ways you could

674
00:39:32.976 --> 00:39:34.116
segment audiences.

675
00:39:35.266 --> 00:39:38.246
You know your business and
your app, and your users best.

676
00:39:38.946 --> 00:39:42.156
So you will segment your
users the way you want it.

677
00:39:42.866 --> 00:39:45.326
And for you to easily
create segments,

678
00:39:47.156 --> 00:39:49.876
we're introducing a new
functionality this fall

679
00:39:50.146 --> 00:39:54.346
with iOS 8 which we call
Audience Segmentation.

680
00:39:55.736 --> 00:39:59.026
Building segments using Audience
Segmentation is very easy.

681
00:39:59.816 --> 00:40:01.386
You can do it in just two steps.

682
00:39:59.816 --> 00:40:01.386
You can do it in just two steps.

683
00:40:03.436 --> 00:40:08.686
The first one is you get
segment IDs from iAd Workbench.

684
00:40:10.116 --> 00:40:14.496
Now, every segment is unique
so it has a unique segment ID.

685
00:40:15.346 --> 00:40:17.846
You can download the segment
IDs from iAd Workbench.

686
00:40:18.906 --> 00:40:20.286
Once you get the segment IDs,

687
00:40:20.986 --> 00:40:24.546
you then integrate those
segment IDs in your app.

688
00:40:26.496 --> 00:40:29.886
You map the user behavior of
the functionality you have

689
00:40:29.886 --> 00:40:32.466
in the app with these
segment IDs.

690
00:40:33.816 --> 00:40:36.596
And when the user demonstrates
a particular user behavior

691
00:40:37.076 --> 00:40:40.226
or reaches a functionality,
say reaches a particular level,

692
00:40:41.026 --> 00:40:42.776
you instrument it in a way

693
00:40:42.776 --> 00:40:48.136
that you automatically make API
call using the new iOS 8 SDK,

694
00:40:48.136 --> 00:40:52.636
and pass that segment
ID onto Workbench.

695
00:40:54.416 --> 00:40:55.736
Now when you do that,

696
00:40:56.446 --> 00:40:59.366
your segments will automatically
start getting populated

697
00:40:59.476 --> 00:41:00.296
on iAd Workbench.

698
00:40:59.476 --> 00:41:00.296
on iAd Workbench.

699
00:41:00.756 --> 00:41:03.986
Here's an example where
segmentation was done based

700
00:41:03.986 --> 00:41:05.976
on time spent in an app.

701
00:41:07.116 --> 00:41:10.616
To avail your segments, users
who have spent less than 1 hour

702
00:41:10.616 --> 00:41:17.486
in the app, 1 to 10 hours, 10 to
20 and 20 plus hours in the app.

703
00:41:17.746 --> 00:41:21.106
Now, if you were to reconnect
or re-engage with these users,

704
00:41:21.976 --> 00:41:25.066
you would probably have a very
different strategy when it comes

705
00:41:25.066 --> 00:41:28.506
to reengaging you with users
who have spent less than an hour

706
00:41:28.506 --> 00:41:32.306
in your app compared to who
have spent more than 20 hours.

707
00:41:34.476 --> 00:41:36.256
Here's another example

708
00:41:36.406 --> 00:41:39.296
where segmentation is
based on levels of use.

709
00:41:41.996 --> 00:41:44.536
Whenever a user reaches
a particular level,

710
00:41:45.646 --> 00:41:47.276
they go from level 1 to level 2.

711
00:41:47.946 --> 00:41:50.826
The API call that I talked
about is automatically made

712
00:41:50.826 --> 00:41:52.466
from the client side
from your app

713
00:41:53.316 --> 00:41:54.866
and the right segment
ID is passed

714
00:41:55.406 --> 00:41:57.736
and the user gets added
to this new segment.

715
00:41:58.636 --> 00:42:01.616
So once you do segmentation
this way using iOS 8,

716
00:41:58.636 --> 00:42:01.616
So once you do segmentation
this way using iOS 8,

717
00:42:02.956 --> 00:42:07.456
we can unlock some amazing
things which brings us

718
00:42:07.456 --> 00:42:09.376
to the second thing that
we're introducing this fall,

719
00:42:10.326 --> 00:42:12.096
we call it Audience Insights.

720
00:42:14.296 --> 00:42:17.776
When your segments reach a
particular threshold of users,

721
00:42:19.176 --> 00:42:22.576
we will show you unique audience
insights into your segments,

722
00:42:23.826 --> 00:42:26.826
all for free at no charge.

723
00:42:27.356 --> 00:42:29.306
These insights are
based on iTunes data.

724
00:42:30.726 --> 00:42:33.556
So we'll show you how the
distribution is of the users

725
00:42:33.556 --> 00:42:35.976
in your segment, the
demographic distribution.

726
00:42:36.936 --> 00:42:40.236
How age, gender, household
income distribution is

727
00:42:40.346 --> 00:42:41.076
for these users.

728
00:42:42.626 --> 00:42:46.666
We'll show you the top regions,
the top countries, top states,

729
00:42:46.896 --> 00:42:51.556
DMAs these users come from, the
top languages these users have

730
00:42:51.556 --> 00:42:53.976
on their devices as well

731
00:42:53.976 --> 00:42:56.176
as the top iTunes
preferences of these users.

732
00:42:56.176 --> 00:42:58.906
So you know what are the things
they really like to download.

733
00:42:59.316 --> 00:43:02.086
Now once you have
these unique insights,

734
00:42:59.316 --> 00:43:02.086
Now once you have
these unique insights,

735
00:43:03.416 --> 00:43:05.566
you can take some
very tangible actions.

736
00:43:06.256 --> 00:43:12.026
If you know the demographics of
your audience in the segment,

737
00:43:13.066 --> 00:43:17.416
you can fine tune your app to
suit more of the demographics.

738
00:43:18.806 --> 00:43:23.556
If you know the top regions and
the languages of your audience,

739
00:43:24.526 --> 00:43:27.136
you might want to consider
localizing your app.

740
00:43:27.976 --> 00:43:30.736
If you have an English
app and you know

741
00:43:30.736 --> 00:43:33.176
that the top region
is Asia Pacific

742
00:43:33.176 --> 00:43:37.626
and the top language is
Japanese, you might want

743
00:43:37.626 --> 00:43:39.126
to make a Japanese app.

744
00:43:39.186 --> 00:43:42.126
If you created a segment
of all your loyal users,

745
00:43:42.816 --> 00:43:45.756
now you understand
the characteristics

746
00:43:45.756 --> 00:43:46.606
of those audience.

747
00:43:47.946 --> 00:43:51.676
And then using Workbench
targeting, you can find more

748
00:43:51.676 --> 00:43:55.096
of the same and you can
build your audience pool.

749
00:43:55.766 --> 00:43:58.176
And finally, with
audience segmentation

750
00:43:58.926 --> 00:44:00.596
and audience targeting together,

751
00:43:58.926 --> 00:44:00.596
and audience targeting together,

752
00:44:01.786 --> 00:44:03.966
we can bring you
another big thing

753
00:44:04.656 --> 00:44:06.266
which we are also
introducing this fall

754
00:44:06.806 --> 00:44:09.476
and we call it Audience
Retargeting.

755
00:44:09.826 --> 00:44:15.786
Audience retargeting lets you
re-engage with every segment

756
00:44:15.786 --> 00:44:17.916
that you have in
a customized way

757
00:44:18.176 --> 00:44:19.766
so you can give a
custom experience

758
00:44:20.436 --> 00:44:21.506
through each of your segments.

759
00:44:23.056 --> 00:44:25.306
So now when you have
those dormant users

760
00:44:25.306 --> 00:44:28.916
who didn't use your
app, you can re-engage

761
00:44:28.916 --> 00:44:30.856
with those users
with that segment.

762
00:44:31.566 --> 00:44:34.626
Show them a custom message,
motivate them to come back

763
00:44:34.626 --> 00:44:35.526
and try your app again.

764
00:44:36.026 --> 00:44:40.966
And when you have users who
have reached a certain level

765
00:44:41.216 --> 00:44:43.026
and you want to push
them to the next level,

766
00:44:44.096 --> 00:44:46.946
you can create a
segment of the users

767
00:44:46.946 --> 00:44:48.746
who have reached say level 2.

768
00:44:48.996 --> 00:44:51.946
Show them a custom
message about level 3.

769
00:44:52.706 --> 00:44:56.306
When they engage with
that, take them to level 3,

770
00:44:57.306 --> 00:45:01.886
not open the app, deep link
them directly to level 3.

771
00:44:57.306 --> 00:45:01.886
not open the app, deep link
them directly to level 3.

772
00:45:02.336 --> 00:45:05.706
And those users who
had an abundant cart

773
00:45:05.706 --> 00:45:08.976
in your retail app,
you can now re-engage

774
00:45:09.136 --> 00:45:12.156
or retarget those
users irrespective

775
00:45:12.156 --> 00:45:17.216
of what device they are on and
bring them back to your app.

776
00:45:17.976 --> 00:45:23.176
And not only bring them
back, deep link them directly

777
00:45:23.666 --> 00:45:24.486
to the shopping basket,

778
00:45:25.396 --> 00:45:30.256
so in the next step they
can finish the purchase.

779
00:45:30.356 --> 00:45:31.786
So really anything is possible.

780
00:45:32.586 --> 00:45:37.046
For each of your segments, you
can create that awesome message

781
00:45:37.936 --> 00:45:40.746
and take the user to
wherever you want in the app

782
00:45:41.306 --> 00:45:42.366
or even to any website.

783
00:45:43.346 --> 00:45:45.096
Now that's not it.

784
00:45:46.066 --> 00:45:49.656
With audience retargeting,
we'll actually find those users

785
00:45:49.656 --> 00:45:52.756
for you on any iOS device.

786
00:45:54.696 --> 00:45:58.106
So now when you had that example
but you introduce your iPad app,

787
00:45:58.536 --> 00:46:03.736
a new app, now you can
find you iPhone app users

788
00:45:58.536 --> 00:46:03.736
a new app, now you can
find you iPhone app users

789
00:46:04.976 --> 00:46:06.096
when they're on the iPad.

790
00:46:06.546 --> 00:46:11.326
So what we are introducing
here is a cross-app,

791
00:46:12.726 --> 00:46:14.656
cross-device retargeting.

792
00:46:15.706 --> 00:46:16.656
That is huge.

793
00:46:18.556 --> 00:46:20.726
What else is unique about this?

794
00:46:20.976 --> 00:46:24.186
The first thing is
automation that comes with it.

795
00:46:25.036 --> 00:46:28.536
When you build segments
using iOS 8,

796
00:46:29.296 --> 00:46:32.056
your segments are automatically
updated in real-time.

797
00:46:33.396 --> 00:46:38.126
No more of manually harvesting
idea phase, sharing them

798
00:46:38.126 --> 00:46:39.026
with your network partners.

799
00:46:40.546 --> 00:46:43.716
Your data is most secure
when it's in one place.

800
00:46:43.716 --> 00:46:47.536
And there's no better
place than Apple iAd.

801
00:46:47.536 --> 00:46:51.266
When you create segments this
way, segmentation is automated,

802
00:46:52.106 --> 00:46:54.786
audience insights run
based on segmentation,

803
00:46:55.616 --> 00:46:58.206
that's real-time updated as well

804
00:46:58.206 --> 00:47:01.606
as the audience retargeting
is updated in real-time.

805
00:46:58.206 --> 00:47:01.606
as the audience retargeting
is updated in real-time.

806
00:47:02.906 --> 00:47:06.406
The next thing is Privacy.

807
00:47:06.406 --> 00:47:09.606
Audience retargeting and this
entire solution we talked

808
00:47:09.606 --> 00:47:12.646
about is deeply integrated
with iOS.

809
00:47:13.436 --> 00:47:15.576
So you get all the benefits

810
00:47:15.706 --> 00:47:18.136
of the built-in privacy
controls that come with it.

811
00:47:18.576 --> 00:47:21.726
The solution complies with
the Limit Ad Tracking.

812
00:47:22.466 --> 00:47:26.496
So now if you have a user
who has Limit Ad Tracking on,

813
00:47:26.966 --> 00:47:30.256
that user is removed
automatically from the segments.

814
00:47:31.346 --> 00:47:33.006
So the user is not retargeted.

815
00:47:34.346 --> 00:47:35.476
Everything is automated.

816
00:47:36.306 --> 00:47:37.396
You have nothing to worry about.

817
00:47:37.836 --> 00:47:42.756
So with Audience
Segmentation, Audience Insights,

818
00:47:43.316 --> 00:47:45.516
and Audience Retargeting,

819
00:47:46.166 --> 00:47:50.186
iAd becomes-iAd Workbench
becomes a complete solution.

820
00:47:51.256 --> 00:47:54.616
You can, not only acquire
new users and new customers,

821
00:47:55.246 --> 00:47:59.566
you can now understand your
existing users and re-engage

822
00:47:59.566 --> 00:48:01.336
with them to grow your business.

823
00:47:59.566 --> 00:48:01.336
with them to grow your business.

824
00:48:02.766 --> 00:48:03.466
What else is coming?

825
00:48:04.096 --> 00:48:07.256
We'll be introducing two
new ad formats this fall.

826
00:48:08.356 --> 00:48:11.546
Interstitial ads which are also
called as fullscreen banners

827
00:48:12.686 --> 00:48:15.346
and Medium Rectangle
also call as MREC.

828
00:48:16.646 --> 00:48:18.556
Both these ad formats
will be available

829
00:48:18.556 --> 00:48:20.706
on iPad as well as on iPhone.

830
00:48:21.776 --> 00:48:24.926
So with that, you will have
four ad formats to choose:

831
00:48:25.286 --> 00:48:30.346
the banner ads, video ads,
interstitials and MREC.

832
00:48:32.256 --> 00:48:33.366
The next is we're going

833
00:48:33.366 --> 00:48:36.556
to continue enhancing
the iAd Workbench APIs.

834
00:48:37.476 --> 00:48:39.876
We'll introduce iAd
Workbench API 2.0

835
00:48:40.156 --> 00:48:42.866
which will give you a
full read-write campaign

836
00:48:42.866 --> 00:48:43.896
creation capability.

837
00:48:45.266 --> 00:48:47.576
So if you work with a
Demand Side Partner,

838
00:48:47.576 --> 00:48:51.886
also called as DSP, you
can now have your DSP plug

839
00:48:51.886 --> 00:48:55.876
into iAd Workbench and
create and manage campaigns

840
00:48:55.876 --> 00:48:59.066
on your behalf from their
own UI ad interface.

841
00:48:59.326 --> 00:49:01.176
That's a move towards
programmatic buying,

842
00:48:59.326 --> 00:49:01.176
That's a move towards
programmatic buying,

843
00:49:02.016 --> 00:49:04.946
automated way of
booking campaigns

844
00:49:04.946 --> 00:49:06.506
and managing them
from your own UI.

845
00:49:06.756 --> 00:49:09.246
We'll also provide you APIs
for segmentation that we talked

846
00:49:09.246 --> 00:49:10.776
about just in-a little bit ago.

847
00:49:11.536 --> 00:49:13.746
And finally, we'll continue
with the geo expansion.

848
00:49:14.076 --> 00:49:16.736
We'll go in more countries
and there is bunch more things

849
00:49:16.736 --> 00:49:17.716
that we have in plans for you.

850
00:49:18.216 --> 00:49:22.976
So to summarize, as
you saw in the demos

851
00:49:22.976 --> 00:49:25.946
and throughout the talk, iAd
Workbench is the simplest way

852
00:49:25.946 --> 00:49:27.416
for you to reach Apple users.

853
00:49:27.916 --> 00:49:31.276
It's very powerful and
it's open to everyone.

854
00:49:31.906 --> 00:49:34.436
So if you haven't tried
iAd Workbench yet,

855
00:49:35.396 --> 00:49:41.246
go to iadworkbench.apple.com and
log in with just your Apple ID.

856
00:49:41.446 --> 00:49:44.126
Make sure you take advantage of
the APIs that we reviewed today.

857
00:49:44.786 --> 00:49:47.166
And the new ad formats
that are available now

858
00:49:47.376 --> 00:49:48.166
and coming in fall.

859
00:49:49.526 --> 00:49:53.366
And finally, the key thing,
make sure you enable your app

860
00:49:54.636 --> 00:49:58.126
for segmentation so you
can get those free insights

861
00:49:58.126 --> 00:50:01.046
that we just talked about
and you can also re-engage

862
00:49:58.126 --> 00:50:01.046
that we just talked about
and you can also re-engage

863
00:50:01.446 --> 00:50:02.476
with your current customers.

864
00:50:04.046 --> 00:50:06.846
If you have more
questions, please reach

865
00:50:06.846 --> 00:50:08.836
out to our evangelist,
Mark Malone.

866
00:50:09.356 --> 00:50:16.816
We have lots of documentation
on iAd Online Workbench Help.

867
00:50:17.376 --> 00:50:21.126
And you can also find us in
the Apple Developer Forum.

868
00:50:21.656 --> 00:50:26.186
There was a session which
is very related to some

869
00:50:26.186 --> 00:50:27.896
of the things that we
talked about today.

870
00:50:27.896 --> 00:50:29.076
It was yesterday.

871
00:50:29.076 --> 00:50:32.416
In case you missed it, make
sure you watch it later on.

872
00:50:33.486 --> 00:50:34.986
In that session,
we talked about how

873
00:50:34.986 --> 00:50:36.966
to use the API for segmentation.

874
00:50:36.966 --> 00:50:38.156
So if you're interested in that,

875
00:50:38.156 --> 00:50:40.496
make sure you take
a look at that.

876
00:50:40.496 --> 00:50:40.886
That's it.

877
00:50:41.296 --> 00:50:43.386
Thank you and have a great WWDC.
