1
00:00:12.156 --> 00:00:12.736
>> Hi everyone.

2
00:00:13.156 --> 00:00:16.146
I'm Clare and I'm on the
iOS Accessibility Team here

3
00:00:16.146 --> 00:00:16.486
at Apple.

4
00:00:16.776 --> 00:00:20.136
Today, I'll be sharing with
you about accessibility on iOS,

5
00:00:20.816 --> 00:00:25.376
and how you can develop your
apps to be used by everyone.

6
00:00:25.706 --> 00:00:28.886
Our talk today is going
to be in two parts.

7
00:00:30.116 --> 00:00:32.716
First, I'll give an
introduction to accessibility.

8
00:00:33.576 --> 00:00:35.606
I'll talk about some of
the features we offer

9
00:00:35.606 --> 00:00:39.796
on iOS currently, as well as
some new things coming in iOS 8.

10
00:00:40.426 --> 00:00:43.426
In the second part of this talk,

11
00:00:44.256 --> 00:00:46.476
I'll be showing you how you
can make your apps accessible,

12
00:00:47.246 --> 00:00:49.236
both by adding visual
accommodations,

13
00:00:50.476 --> 00:00:52.726
and by implementing
Semantic Accessibility.

14
00:00:58.276 --> 00:01:01.036
So first, what is accessibility?

15
00:00:58.276 --> 00:01:01.036
So first, what is accessibility?

16
00:01:02.156 --> 00:01:03.736
Accessibility is all

17
00:01:03.736 --> 00:01:05.836
about making things
usable for everyone.

18
00:01:06.606 --> 00:01:09.946
On iOS, we look at four
broad areas of user needs.

19
00:01:10.616 --> 00:01:13.906
We want users with physical
and motor challenges,

20
00:01:15.346 --> 00:01:19.156
users with learning needs,
users with hearing loss,

21
00:01:20.106 --> 00:01:21.846
and users with different
vision needs,

22
00:01:22.176 --> 00:01:24.236
to be able to experience
iOS fully.

23
00:01:24.816 --> 00:01:27.366
Our goal is equal
access for everyone.

24
00:01:27.876 --> 00:01:33.576
So let's look at some examples
of how we accomplish this.

25
00:01:33.956 --> 00:01:36.836
Some users may have a physical
impairment that prevents them

26
00:01:36.836 --> 00:01:38.186
from using the touch screen.

27
00:01:38.336 --> 00:01:42.066
In fact, their only [inaudible]
device may be a switch.

28
00:01:42.816 --> 00:01:45.156
A switch could be something
like a button mounted

29
00:01:45.156 --> 00:01:46.186
on a wheelchair headrest.

30
00:01:47.286 --> 00:01:51.276
So how do we make the rich
touch interface of iOS usable

31
00:01:51.276 --> 00:01:53.026
by someone who can
only use a switch?

32
00:01:53.576 --> 00:01:57.636
Our answer is Switch Control.

33
00:01:57.876 --> 00:02:02.356
When Switch Control is enabled,
a cursor appears on the screen,

34
00:01:57.876 --> 00:02:02.356
When Switch Control is enabled,
a cursor appears on the screen,

35
00:02:02.746 --> 00:02:07.066
and it moves from item to
item with a specific timing.

36
00:02:07.426 --> 00:02:12.086
When the user activates their
switch, that lets them interact

37
00:02:12.256 --> 00:02:13.266
with a highlighted element,

38
00:02:13.806 --> 00:02:16.646
so they can do things
like tap or scroll.

39
00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:21.566
Next, let's look at learning.

40
00:02:21.766 --> 00:02:24.846
iOS devices have been incredibly
powerful in the classroom,

41
00:02:24.846 --> 00:02:27.576
because of their
easy to use interface

42
00:02:28.136 --> 00:02:29.136
and their engaging apps.

43
00:02:30.096 --> 00:02:32.086
For the same reasons,
they've been great

44
00:02:32.086 --> 00:02:33.626
for children with autism.

45
00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:37.196
But for these users, we faced
some unique challenges at first.

46
00:02:38.056 --> 00:02:41.236
For one, when a child with
autism is learning in an app,

47
00:02:41.816 --> 00:02:43.616
they might decide to
press the Home button.

48
00:02:44.026 --> 00:02:46.336
And now the device is
full of distractions.

49
00:02:46.896 --> 00:02:50.896
So to address this issue,
we created Guided Access,

50
00:02:51.096 --> 00:02:53.326
which is a way for
parents or educators

51
00:02:53.636 --> 00:02:56.286
to keep the device
in a specific app.

52
00:02:56.916 --> 00:03:00.426
When Guided Access is enabled,
pressing the Home button

53
00:02:56.916 --> 00:03:00.426
When Guided Access is enabled,
pressing the Home button

54
00:03:00.596 --> 00:03:02.036
or the Lock button
have no effect,

55
00:03:02.836 --> 00:03:05.846
and so the child can have
an uninterrupted learning

56
00:03:05.846 --> 00:03:07.716
experience, free
from distractions.

57
00:03:08.076 --> 00:03:12.116
Next, let's look at hearing.

58
00:03:13.056 --> 00:03:15.846
Many users with hearing
loss use hearing aids

59
00:03:15.976 --> 00:03:17.806
to help amplify the
sound around them,

60
00:03:18.316 --> 00:03:21.136
but traditional hearing aids
come with a couple of issues.

61
00:03:22.056 --> 00:03:25.876
First, they require that
you carry a remote with you

62
00:03:25.876 --> 00:03:27.326
so that you can adjust
the volume,

63
00:03:27.606 --> 00:03:28.946
and that can be cumbersome.

64
00:03:30.176 --> 00:03:33.346
And second, call quality
can be less than optimal

65
00:03:33.656 --> 00:03:34.696
when using a hearing aid.

66
00:03:34.866 --> 00:03:37.096
When you have a phone
next to a hearing aid,

67
00:03:37.266 --> 00:03:40.036
either the hearing aid
amplifies all the sound,

68
00:03:40.036 --> 00:03:43.826
including background noise,
or it picks up the signal

69
00:03:44.006 --> 00:03:45.656
from the phone's
electromagnetic field,

70
00:03:46.096 --> 00:03:49.286
but that signal can also
be noisy, creating static.

71
00:03:49.906 --> 00:03:54.326
So to address these two
issues, we partnered

72
00:03:54.326 --> 00:03:56.516
with hearing aid
manufacturers around the globe

73
00:03:56.956 --> 00:03:58.566
to create made-for-iPhone
hearing aids.

74
00:03:59.236 --> 00:04:01.866
These hearing aids connect
directly to your iPhone,

75
00:03:59.236 --> 00:04:01.866
These hearing aids connect
directly to your iPhone,

76
00:04:02.196 --> 00:04:04.516
and you can do things
like adjust the volume

77
00:04:04.516 --> 00:04:07.246
of your hearing aids, without
the need for a separate remote.

78
00:04:07.776 --> 00:04:10.866
In addition, audio streams
directly from your iPhone

79
00:04:11.036 --> 00:04:11.806
to your hearing aid,

80
00:04:12.036 --> 00:04:14.116
so it becomes effectively
a Bluetooth headset.

81
00:04:14.306 --> 00:04:17.245
And that improves call
quality dramatically.

82
00:04:17.666 --> 00:04:23.656
Finally, let's look at
the broad area of vision.

83
00:04:24.146 --> 00:04:26.266
When the iPhone was
first introduced,

84
00:04:26.876 --> 00:04:29.916
many people were concerned that
blind users would not be able

85
00:04:29.916 --> 00:04:31.286
to take advantage
of its features.

86
00:04:31.476 --> 00:04:35.096
Because if you think about it,
how do you use a touch screen

87
00:04:35.546 --> 00:04:36.856
if you don't see the screen.

88
00:04:37.636 --> 00:04:38.776
It's going to be difficult

89
00:04:38.776 --> 00:04:41.046
because you won't necessarily
know what you're touching,

90
00:04:41.436 --> 00:04:43.116
and you might accidentally
tap a button

91
00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:46.206
that you didn't mean to tap.

92
00:04:46.206 --> 00:04:48.756
So to address this,
we created VoiceOver.

93
00:04:49.646 --> 00:04:53.126
When VoiceOver is enabled,
a user can touch anywhere

94
00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:55.636
on screen to hear what
they just touched,

95
00:04:56.066 --> 00:05:02.976
before they take an action
like tapping a button.

96
00:04:56.066 --> 00:05:02.976
before they take an action
like tapping a button.

97
00:05:03.326 --> 00:05:06.236
We also have accommodations
in our settings for users

98
00:05:06.236 --> 00:05:09.516
with low vision who may not
necessarily need the full power

99
00:05:09.516 --> 00:05:10.226
of VoiceOver.

100
00:05:10.526 --> 00:05:13.986
For example, some users
prefer bolder fonts,

101
00:05:14.266 --> 00:05:18.746
in which case they can enable
bold text to get thicker text.

102
00:05:19.176 --> 00:05:22.396
Some users may need
higher contrast, and if so,

103
00:05:22.396 --> 00:05:24.786
we offer several options,
including the ability

104
00:05:24.786 --> 00:05:27.136
to reduce transparency
on the system.

105
00:05:29.476 --> 00:05:32.716
And finally, for users who
are more sensitive to motion,

106
00:05:32.926 --> 00:05:34.356
we offer a Reduce
Motion setting,

107
00:05:34.356 --> 00:05:36.526
which provides more
subtle transitions.

108
00:05:36.896 --> 00:05:40.076
For example, when you launch an
app with Reduce Motion enabled,

109
00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:43.516
it cross-fades into view.

110
00:05:46.716 --> 00:05:49.356
So that's some of what
we offer on iOS currently

111
00:05:49.356 --> 00:05:50.636
to support equal access.

112
00:05:51.076 --> 00:05:54.026
But we've been working hard, and
I'd like to highlight just some

113
00:05:54.026 --> 00:05:56.026
of the new features
we're offering in iOS 8.

114
00:05:56.616 --> 00:06:01.426
First, Guided Access
Time Limits.

115
00:05:56.616 --> 00:06:01.426
First, Guided Access
Time Limits.

116
00:06:02.166 --> 00:06:03.966
Time limits are all
about transitions.

117
00:06:04.286 --> 00:06:08.496
When a child is immersed in an
app, and then it's time to move

118
00:06:08.496 --> 00:06:09.506
on to the next activity,

119
00:06:09.776 --> 00:06:12.186
that transition can
cause some anxiety.

120
00:06:13.036 --> 00:06:16.886
With time limits, a caretaker
can assign a specific amount

121
00:06:16.996 --> 00:06:18.696
of time that a child
should use an app.

122
00:06:19.066 --> 00:06:21.386
When the time limit
is almost reached,

123
00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:24.756
the child receives a warning,
helping them to prepare to move

124
00:06:24.756 --> 00:06:25.836
on to the next activity.

125
00:06:26.116 --> 00:06:29.886
And when the time limit
is over, the device locks.

126
00:06:30.366 --> 00:06:32.676
Next, we're bringing
Alex to iOS.

127
00:06:32.786 --> 00:06:35.456
Some of you may have
already met Alex.

128
00:06:35.806 --> 00:06:37.986
But for those who haven't,
I'll let him introduce himself.

129
00:06:39.316 --> 00:06:40.686
>> Hi everyone.

130
00:06:41.316 --> 00:06:44.066
I'm Alex. And I'm
the US English voice.

131
00:06:44.836 --> 00:06:48.746
I've been living on Macs for
years, and now I'm excited

132
00:06:48.746 --> 00:06:51.036
to make myself at home on iOS.

133
00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:54.046
>> So Alex will be
available in all

134
00:06:54.046 --> 00:06:56.276
of our assistive
technologies that use speech,

135
00:06:56.626 --> 00:06:58.926
including VoiceOver,
Speak Selection,

136
00:07:00.216 --> 00:07:01.866
and a new feature
we're introducing

137
00:07:01.866 --> 00:07:03.656
in iOS 8, called Speak Screen.

138
00:07:04.136 --> 00:07:06.086
Speak Screen is great for anyone

139
00:07:06.156 --> 00:07:07.546
who might have trouble
reading the screen.

140
00:07:07.696 --> 00:07:12.336
When it's enabled, you can do
a simple gesture or ask Siri

141
00:07:12.336 --> 00:07:13.336
to speak the screen to you,

142
00:07:13.336 --> 00:07:16.776
and the device will start
reading whatever's on screen.

143
00:07:17.326 --> 00:07:20.666
You also get options, like
the ability to pause, rewind,

144
00:07:21.086 --> 00:07:22.436
or again slow down the speech.

145
00:07:22.726 --> 00:07:27.476
And finally, I'd like
to highlight Zoom.

146
00:07:27.946 --> 00:07:30.836
Some of you may have been
using Zoom for years on iOS,

147
00:07:31.296 --> 00:07:35.486
but we've re-imagined it in
iOS 8, and have a whole new way

148
00:07:35.486 --> 00:07:37.616
for you to interact with it.

149
00:07:38.206 --> 00:07:40.616
But before I introduce
that, let's first talk

150
00:07:40.616 --> 00:07:42.056
about what Zoom does currently.

151
00:07:42.556 --> 00:07:46.496
Zoom magnifies the
entire screen,

152
00:07:46.916 --> 00:07:49.586
and then you use three-finger
gestures to navigate.

153
00:07:50.796 --> 00:07:52.966
This approach comes
with a few issues.

154
00:07:53.816 --> 00:07:56.496
First, if you're using
three-finger gestures,

155
00:07:57.026 --> 00:08:00.286
that means you're covering up a
significant part of the screen,

156
00:07:57.026 --> 00:08:00.286
that means you're covering up a
significant part of the screen,

157
00:08:00.286 --> 00:08:03.406
especially on iPhones.

158
00:08:04.436 --> 00:08:06.856
Also using three-finger
gestures means it's hard

159
00:08:06.856 --> 00:08:08.196
to use a phone on the go.

160
00:08:08.726 --> 00:08:11.406
You can't use the phone in a
single hand, you always need

161
00:08:11.406 --> 00:08:13.926
to have one hand to hold
it, and the other hand

162
00:08:13.926 --> 00:08:15.036
to do the three-finger gestures.

163
00:08:16.096 --> 00:08:20.996
And finally, typing can be
tricky with Zoom enabled.

164
00:08:21.396 --> 00:08:23.196
You have the choice
between zooming

165
00:08:23.196 --> 00:08:25.266
in on the content
you're creating,

166
00:08:26.166 --> 00:08:27.976
or having access to
the full keyboard.

167
00:08:28.536 --> 00:08:30.726
But you can't have
both at the same time.

168
00:08:31.296 --> 00:08:35.126
So to address all
of these issues,

169
00:08:35.126 --> 00:08:37.706
we're introducing a new
windowed mode for Zoom.

170
00:08:37.836 --> 00:08:39.265
And I'd like to demo
that to you now.

171
00:08:40.645 --> 00:08:42.525
This is windowed Zoom.

172
00:08:42.726 --> 00:08:45.346
Notice how only part of
the screen is magnified?

173
00:08:45.696 --> 00:08:49.366
I can change what part is
magnified by dragging the edge

174
00:08:49.526 --> 00:08:51.046
of the window with
a single finger.

175
00:08:52.056 --> 00:08:56.456
I can also tap the edge of the
window to get resize handles,

176
00:08:56.586 --> 00:08:58.806
so I can change how much
of the screen is magnified.

177
00:08:59.366 --> 00:09:04.156
If I tap on the arrow at the
edge of the window, I get a menu

178
00:08:59.366 --> 00:09:04.156
If I tap on the arrow at the
edge of the window, I get a menu

179
00:09:04.156 --> 00:09:06.176
with several options,
including the ability

180
00:09:06.176 --> 00:09:07.306
to adjust my Zoom level.

181
00:09:07.606 --> 00:09:11.456
Now, let's go into notes.

182
00:09:11.456 --> 00:09:16.266
I'm going to create a new
note, and watch what happens

183
00:09:16.266 --> 00:09:17.666
when the keyboard comes up.

184
00:09:18.536 --> 00:09:21.046
The Zoom window automatically
got out of the way

185
00:09:21.046 --> 00:09:23.516
of the keyboard, so I have
full access of the keyboard,

186
00:09:23.806 --> 00:09:25.236
but my content is zoomed.

187
00:09:25.536 --> 00:09:31.996
And as I type, notice how the
Zoom window follows my cursor.

188
00:09:31.996 --> 00:09:33.916
So I can always see
what I just typed.

189
00:09:35.196 --> 00:09:37.436
So that's some of what we've
been doing here at Apple

190
00:09:37.846 --> 00:09:39.746
to promote equal
access for everyone.

191
00:09:40.636 --> 00:09:43.626
But for the second part of
the story, we need your help.

192
00:09:44.266 --> 00:09:48.036
IOS is a great platform because
of all the apps you guys create,

193
00:09:48.186 --> 00:09:50.106
and it's up to you to make sure

194
00:09:50.106 --> 00:09:52.266
that your apps can
be used by everyone.

195
00:09:52.876 --> 00:09:56.906
To that end, I'll be showing
you now how you can do

196
00:09:56.906 --> 00:09:57.706
that with our API.

197
00:10:00.296 --> 00:10:02.506
Our tutorial is going
to be in two parts.

198
00:10:02.906 --> 00:10:06.516
First, I'll show you how to add
visual accommodations for users

199
00:10:06.516 --> 00:10:07.506
with different vision needs.

200
00:10:07.826 --> 00:10:09.846
And second, I'll
be showing you how

201
00:10:09.846 --> 00:10:11.616
to implement some
magic accessibility.

202
00:10:12.026 --> 00:10:16.356
So an assistive technology like
VoiceOver can navigate your app.

203
00:10:16.356 --> 00:10:17.906
Earlier in this talk,
I showed some

204
00:10:17.906 --> 00:10:20.996
of the visual accommodations
we offer on iOS for users

205
00:10:20.996 --> 00:10:21.946
with different vision needs.

206
00:10:22.636 --> 00:10:24.306
Now, we're providing API,

207
00:10:24.876 --> 00:10:26.346
so you can make those
accommodations

208
00:10:26.346 --> 00:10:27.456
in your apps as well.

209
00:10:28.296 --> 00:10:31.826
We have a way for you to detect
whether the user has bold text,

210
00:10:32.226 --> 00:10:34.536
reduced transparency,
darkened colors,

211
00:10:34.636 --> 00:10:36.106
or Reduce Motion enabled.

212
00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:37.986
And that makes it
really easy for you

213
00:10:38.176 --> 00:10:41.116
to make specific adjustments
in your app for those users.

214
00:10:41.646 --> 00:10:44.776
So I'd like to show you
how you can do that now,

215
00:10:45.476 --> 00:10:47.636
using a sample app we've
created for this presentation.

216
00:10:48.216 --> 00:10:51.636
Okay, so first we're going to
identify some areas of our app

217
00:10:51.786 --> 00:10:53.206
that need visual accommodations.

218
00:10:53.416 --> 00:10:55.816
To do that, I've
gone to my simulator,

219
00:10:55.886 --> 00:10:58.606
and I've enabled several of
the accessibility settings.

220
00:10:58.766 --> 00:11:02.476
In this case, I've got
Bold Text, Reduce Motion,

221
00:10:58.766 --> 00:11:02.476
In this case, I've got
Bold Text, Reduce Motion,

222
00:11:03.096 --> 00:11:04.626
and underneath Increase
Contrast,

223
00:11:04.626 --> 00:11:06.706
I've also got Reduced
Transparency

224
00:11:06.996 --> 00:11:07.906
and Darkened Colors.

225
00:11:08.166 --> 00:11:11.376
So that way, when we build
and run our app from Xcode,

226
00:11:11.376 --> 00:11:13.986
we'll see what a user with
those settings will see.

227
00:11:14.596 --> 00:11:16.196
So now, I'm going to Xcode.

228
00:11:16.196 --> 00:11:20.236
I'm going to click
on build and run.

229
00:11:20.366 --> 00:11:22.966
So this is a simple dating app.

230
00:11:23.056 --> 00:11:24.786
At the top, you have
the title of the app,

231
00:11:24.786 --> 00:11:25.766
which is HelloGoodbye.

232
00:11:26.166 --> 00:11:28.536
Notice how the title
is very bold,

233
00:11:28.726 --> 00:11:30.786
and the background
is fully opaque.

234
00:11:31.086 --> 00:11:34.506
That's because we're using a
standard navigation controller.

235
00:11:34.646 --> 00:11:36.056
So we get the bold text

236
00:11:36.286 --> 00:11:38.786
and reduced transparency
behaviors for free.

237
00:11:39.306 --> 00:11:42.456
But because we're doing
some custom UI in our app,

238
00:11:42.696 --> 00:11:44.346
there's still some
work we need to do.

239
00:11:44.776 --> 00:11:48.526
You probably already noticed
how we have transparent overlays

240
00:11:48.636 --> 00:11:49.846
over a photo background.

241
00:11:50.646 --> 00:11:52.566
When reduced transparency is on,

242
00:11:52.566 --> 00:11:54.256
we should really be
making those opaque.

243
00:11:55.216 --> 00:11:59.126
In addition, the text in the
buttons should be thicker

244
00:11:59.126 --> 00:12:00.876
because we have bold
text enabled.

245
00:11:59.126 --> 00:12:00.876
because we have bold
text enabled.

246
00:12:01.616 --> 00:12:04.896
Now I'm going to click
on the Profile button.

247
00:12:06.126 --> 00:12:08.906
So here's where as a user
I can adjust my settings.

248
00:12:09.506 --> 00:12:12.826
Again, we have the transparent
overlay, and the text

249
00:12:12.826 --> 00:12:13.726
that should be bolder.

250
00:12:14.516 --> 00:12:18.026
At the bottom of this view,
we have a preview tab,

251
00:12:18.026 --> 00:12:21.066
which I can slide up
to see how other users

252
00:12:21.066 --> 00:12:22.686
in this app will see my profile.

253
00:12:23.786 --> 00:12:27.046
Notice how my info is in gray
text under each of the headings.

254
00:12:27.936 --> 00:12:30.096
When the user has
darkened colors enabled,

255
00:12:30.406 --> 00:12:32.306
it would be better if
that text were darker

256
00:12:32.776 --> 00:12:35.266
to provide higher contrast
against the white background.

257
00:12:36.556 --> 00:12:39.646
Now, I'm going to click on
Back and I'm going to go

258
00:12:39.646 --> 00:12:40.976
into the Matches page.

259
00:12:41.286 --> 00:12:44.136
So here's where I
can see matches

260
00:12:44.136 --> 00:12:45.736
that the app is suggesting
for me.

261
00:12:46.006 --> 00:12:48.176
And I can say hello or
goodbye to each one.

262
00:12:48.456 --> 00:12:52.156
I like this guy's
elevator pitch,

263
00:12:52.156 --> 00:12:53.886
so I'm going to say hello.

264
00:12:54.126 --> 00:12:58.346
And watch what happens
when I swipe up.

265
00:12:58.606 --> 00:13:01.696
Notice how the next
match animates on screen

266
00:12:58.606 --> 00:13:01.696
Notice how the next
match animates on screen

267
00:13:02.016 --> 00:13:03.466
as though it's coming
from far away.

268
00:13:03.946 --> 00:13:06.776
So that's an example
of an animation

269
00:13:06.776 --> 00:13:09.396
where we should provide
an alternate to users

270
00:13:09.396 --> 00:13:13.836
who are more sensitive
to motion.

271
00:13:14.076 --> 00:13:17.786
And now, let's do all this,
using the API in Xcode.

272
00:13:18.696 --> 00:13:20.796
So the first thing we're
going to address is the text.

273
00:13:21.436 --> 00:13:23.726
Let's make sure that it's
thicker when bold text is on.

274
00:13:24.036 --> 00:13:26.996
To do that, I'm going to click
on the Style Utilities file

275
00:13:26.996 --> 00:13:29.066
on the left, which is
where all of our colors

276
00:13:29.066 --> 00:13:30.026
and fonts are defined.

277
00:13:30.306 --> 00:13:32.346
I'm going to click on
the drop-down at the top,

278
00:13:33.246 --> 00:13:34.716
to find our font methods.

279
00:13:35.366 --> 00:13:40.116
Notice how both of these methods
are returning Avenir-Light

280
00:13:40.116 --> 00:13:41.746
as a custom font.

281
00:13:41.936 --> 00:13:45.356
Now, if we were using the system
font, or the preferred font

282
00:13:45.356 --> 00:13:48.936
for text style API, we would
be getting bold text for free.

283
00:13:49.566 --> 00:13:52.516
But because we've picked
a specific font to use,

284
00:13:52.986 --> 00:13:55.816
we also need to pick a font to
use when bold text is enabled.

285
00:13:55.816 --> 00:14:01.306
So to do that, I'd like
to create a helper method,

286
00:13:55.816 --> 00:14:01.306
So to do that, I'd like
to create a helper method,

287
00:14:01.776 --> 00:14:03.806
that returns a font name.

288
00:14:04.166 --> 00:14:07.126
All we're doing here is first
checking whether bold text

289
00:14:07.126 --> 00:14:07.736
is enabled.

290
00:14:07.776 --> 00:14:12.506
If it is, we can return a
thicker version of our font.

291
00:14:12.856 --> 00:14:15.206
Otherwise, we can return the
same font we've been using.

292
00:14:15.876 --> 00:14:21.666
And now, we just need to use our
helper in our 2-font methods.

293
00:14:24.876 --> 00:14:26.676
So that takes care of bold text.

294
00:14:27.096 --> 00:14:29.306
Now, let's look at those
transparent overlays.

295
00:14:29.636 --> 00:14:32.936
I'm going to click on the
drop-down at the top and find

296
00:14:32.936 --> 00:14:35.536
where that transparent
overlay color is defined.

297
00:14:37.136 --> 00:14:39.976
Notice how right now we're
returning an 80 percent white.

298
00:14:40.946 --> 00:14:42.556
When reduced transparency
is enabled,

299
00:14:42.556 --> 00:14:48.416
we should return a 100 percent
white, so we do that here.

300
00:14:48.926 --> 00:14:51.586
Okay. Now, let's make
sure that the gray text

301
00:14:51.806 --> 00:14:55.046
in the profile preview is
darker when Darken Colors is on.

302
00:14:55.866 --> 00:14:58.436
To do that, I'm going to
click on the drop-down again,

303
00:14:58.726 --> 00:15:00.586
and find where that
color is defined.

304
00:14:58.726 --> 00:15:00.586
and find where that
color is defined.

305
00:15:01.256 --> 00:15:02.946
So here, we're just
returning gray.

306
00:15:04.176 --> 00:15:07.246
Let's first check whether the
user has Darken Colors enabled,

307
00:15:07.496 --> 00:15:12.716
and if so, we can
return black instead.

308
00:15:13.026 --> 00:15:15.816
Finally, let's look at that
zooming animation that we saw

309
00:15:15.816 --> 00:15:18.066
on the Matches page, where
the new match appears

310
00:15:18.066 --> 00:15:19.576
as though it's coming
from far away.

311
00:15:19.846 --> 00:15:22.326
To address that,
I'm going to click

312
00:15:22.326 --> 00:15:25.156
on the Matches View
Controller on the left.

313
00:15:25.156 --> 00:15:26.526
Now I'm going to
open the drop down,

314
00:15:26.836 --> 00:15:31.936
and find where we
animate the cards.

315
00:15:32.076 --> 00:15:34.966
So notice how here we're
zooming the new card into view.

316
00:15:35.626 --> 00:15:37.746
Now, for users who have
Reduce Motion enabled,

317
00:15:37.976 --> 00:15:41.596
a better experience would be
to fade the card into view,

318
00:15:41.596 --> 00:15:45.756
because that animation does
not utilize a motion effect.

319
00:15:46.116 --> 00:15:48.376
So I'm going to create
a helper method

320
00:15:48.776 --> 00:15:50.096
that fades the card into view.

321
00:15:50.516 --> 00:15:52.426
All we're doing is
setting the alpha

322
00:15:52.426 --> 00:15:53.956
of the card with animation.

323
00:15:54.866 --> 00:15:57.496
And then at the point where
normally we would Zoom the card,

324
00:15:58.086 --> 00:16:01.336
let's first check whether
Reduce Motion is enabled.

325
00:15:58.086 --> 00:16:01.336
let's first check whether
Reduce Motion is enabled.

326
00:16:01.936 --> 00:16:04.656
If it is, we use our
fading method instead.

327
00:16:05.106 --> 00:16:08.236
We can use the Zooming
method for other users.

328
00:16:09.396 --> 00:16:11.766
Okay, now let's build and run
our app with these changes.

329
00:16:11.766 --> 00:16:16.616
Here's our app again.

330
00:16:16.996 --> 00:16:19.076
Notice how the transparent
overlays are gone,

331
00:16:19.126 --> 00:16:21.036
and have been replaced
by opaque white,

332
00:16:21.446 --> 00:16:22.966
because reduced transparency
is enabled.

333
00:16:23.656 --> 00:16:26.206
In addition, the text on
the buttons is much thicker.

334
00:16:26.666 --> 00:16:29.756
When I click on Profile, again,

335
00:16:30.496 --> 00:16:32.776
the same issues have
been resolved here.

336
00:16:33.486 --> 00:16:35.246
I can slide up on the View tab,

337
00:16:35.796 --> 00:16:38.836
and now notice how my
information is darker

338
00:16:38.976 --> 00:16:40.916
and higher contrast against
the white background.

339
00:16:41.696 --> 00:16:45.836
Now I'm going to click on Back
and click on the Matches button.

340
00:16:47.746 --> 00:16:49.986
Again, I'm going to say
hello to my favorite match,

341
00:16:50.326 --> 00:16:52.306
and watch what happens
when I do that.

342
00:16:53.776 --> 00:16:55.886
The next match fades onto view,

343
00:16:55.976 --> 00:16:57.716
because we have Reduce
Motion enabled.

344
00:16:58.196 --> 00:17:03.016
So that's how easy it is for you
to make visual accommodations

345
00:16:58.196 --> 00:17:03.016
So that's how easy it is for you
to make visual accommodations

346
00:17:03.016 --> 00:17:06.146
in your app for users with
different vision needs.

347
00:17:07.695 --> 00:17:10.876
Next, let's look at implementing
Semantic Accessibility,

348
00:17:11.586 --> 00:17:12.846
so that VoiceOver users

349
00:17:13.506 --> 00:17:16.566
and Switch Control users
can also use your app.

350
00:17:18.896 --> 00:17:22.675
Semantic Accessibility is what
allows an assistive technology

351
00:17:22.675 --> 00:17:26.685
like VoiceOver to get
information from an app,

352
00:17:26.685 --> 00:17:28.566
and to control the
app doing things

353
00:17:28.566 --> 00:17:30.796
like tapping buttons
or adjusting sliders.

354
00:17:31.336 --> 00:17:36.926
Here's an example of Semantic
Accessibility at work.

355
00:17:37.886 --> 00:17:40.056
Let's say I've got the
calculator app open

356
00:17:40.136 --> 00:17:41.266
and VoiceOver is enabled.

357
00:17:41.446 --> 00:17:46.236
When I touch on top of the 5
button, VoiceOver intercepts

358
00:17:46.236 --> 00:17:51.666
that touch, and then it asks the
app what it has at that point.

359
00:17:52.776 --> 00:17:56.136
The app responds with an element
that represents the 5 button.

360
00:17:56.316 --> 00:17:59.756
And that allows VoiceOver to
draw a cursor around the 5,

361
00:18:00.296 --> 00:18:04.706
and to speak 5, so that I
know what I've just touched.

362
00:18:04.806 --> 00:18:07.136
If I then decide to
tap the 5 button,

363
00:18:07.246 --> 00:18:09.476
I can do a double tap
anywhere on screen,

364
00:18:09.606 --> 00:18:12.826
and that tells VoiceOver to
activate the selected item.

365
00:18:13.416 --> 00:18:18.286
So that's how VoiceOver users
can use the calculator app.

366
00:18:21.436 --> 00:18:25.556
So how do you make sure
that your app works

367
00:18:25.556 --> 00:18:27.396
with VoiceOver in
this way as well?

368
00:18:28.026 --> 00:18:32.256
Well, the good news is that
most Semantic Accessibility is

369
00:18:32.256 --> 00:18:35.616
already built into iOS, so you
get a lot of stuff for free.

370
00:18:36.216 --> 00:18:38.256
But you should still
audit your app

371
00:18:38.306 --> 00:18:39.666
with VoiceOver on the device.

372
00:18:40.126 --> 00:18:42.376
And there are a couple questions
you should ask yourself.

373
00:18:42.836 --> 00:18:46.446
First, can VoiceOver
speak everything

374
00:18:46.446 --> 00:18:47.286
that needs to be seen?

375
00:18:48.546 --> 00:18:51.066
And second, can VoiceOver
do everything

376
00:18:51.236 --> 00:18:53.576
that a user would want to do?

377
00:18:53.886 --> 00:18:56.466
Now, I'm going to be referring
a lot to VoiceOver in this talk,

378
00:18:56.796 --> 00:18:59.426
but all of the work we're going
to do in our app also applies

379
00:18:59.426 --> 00:19:01.926
to Switch Control, so
just keep that in mind.

380
00:18:59.426 --> 00:19:01.926
to Switch Control, so
just keep that in mind.

381
00:19:04.076 --> 00:19:07.736
To set up an audit of your app
for Semantic Accessibility,

382
00:19:07.916 --> 00:19:10.696
I recommend that you go to
your Accessibility settings

383
00:19:10.696 --> 00:19:13.446
on the device, and set
your accessibility shortcut

384
00:19:13.786 --> 00:19:14.416
to VoiceOver.

385
00:19:15.156 --> 00:19:18.186
That will allow you to
triple click the Home button

386
00:19:18.506 --> 00:19:20.306
to quickly enable or
disable VoiceOver.

387
00:19:20.836 --> 00:19:24.346
If you've never used
VoiceOver before,

388
00:19:25.066 --> 00:19:26.566
here are some tips
to get you started.

389
00:19:28.106 --> 00:19:31.286
When you tap something,
that selects and speaks.

390
00:19:31.966 --> 00:19:33.456
So, for example, in this screen,

391
00:19:33.456 --> 00:19:35.836
if I tap on the accessibility
table cell,

392
00:19:36.826 --> 00:19:40.906
the cursor moves there, and the
device speaks accessibility.

393
00:19:42.596 --> 00:19:46.276
If I double tap anywhere on
screen, that tells VoiceOver

394
00:19:46.276 --> 00:19:48.166
to activate the selected item.

395
00:19:48.716 --> 00:19:50.016
So, in this case, if I did that,

396
00:19:50.736 --> 00:19:52.716
the accessibility table
cell would get pressed,

397
00:19:53.716 --> 00:19:55.346
and we would move to
the accessibility page.

398
00:19:55.446 --> 00:20:01.406
When I swipe to the
right, that selects

399
00:19:55.446 --> 00:20:01.406
When I swipe to the
right, that selects

400
00:20:01.406 --> 00:20:02.906
and speaks the next element.

401
00:20:03.906 --> 00:20:06.486
Right now, the Back button
is selected, so if I swipe

402
00:20:06.486 --> 00:20:09.486
to the right, the Navigation
title becomes selected.

403
00:20:09.486 --> 00:20:13.866
And finally, when you
have a scroll view,

404
00:20:13.866 --> 00:20:16.346
you can use three-finger
swipes to scroll.

405
00:20:17.096 --> 00:20:19.356
So if I want to see more of
the accessibility settings,

406
00:20:19.616 --> 00:20:23.266
I can three-finger swipe
up to scroll down by page.

407
00:20:23.606 --> 00:20:28.906
So that's all you need
to know to do an audit

408
00:20:28.906 --> 00:20:30.256
of your own app with VoiceOver.

409
00:20:30.436 --> 00:20:32.286
And now I'd like to show
you how you can do that,

410
00:20:32.576 --> 00:20:33.396
with our sample app.

411
00:20:33.466 --> 00:20:36.416
So here's our dating app
running on the device.

412
00:20:37.216 --> 00:20:38.526
When I triple click
the home button --

413
00:20:39.966 --> 00:20:40.676
>> VoiceOver on.

414
00:20:41.276 --> 00:20:43.236
>> VoiceOver becomes enabled.

415
00:20:43.566 --> 00:20:45.796
The first thing we'll do is
ask ourselves that question.

416
00:20:45.966 --> 00:20:48.396
Can VoiceOver speak everything
that needs to be seen?

417
00:20:49.096 --> 00:20:51.716
So first, I'm going to tap
on the title at the top.

418
00:20:52.456 --> 00:20:53.266
>> HelloGoodbye.

419
00:20:53.486 --> 00:20:54.306
Heading.

420
00:20:54.306 --> 00:20:55.716
>> Okay, so VoiceOver
can see that.

421
00:20:56.206 --> 00:20:57.966
Now, let's touch on the
logo [beeping sound].

422
00:20:59.156 --> 00:21:04.486
It's kind of quiet, but that
sound we just heard means

423
00:20:59.156 --> 00:21:04.486
It's kind of quiet, but that
sound we just heard means

424
00:21:04.486 --> 00:21:06.036
that VoiceOver doesn't
think there's anything

425
00:21:06.036 --> 00:21:06.776
under my finger.

426
00:21:07.606 --> 00:21:10.766
So it looks like VoiceOver users
won't be able to read this logo.

427
00:21:11.866 --> 00:21:13.996
Now, I'm going to tap
on the profile button.

428
00:21:14.596 --> 00:21:15.906
>> Profile button.

429
00:21:15.906 --> 00:21:17.256
>> And VoiceOver sees that.

430
00:21:17.736 --> 00:21:19.956
When I swipe to the right,
that selects the next element.

431
00:21:19.956 --> 00:21:20.646
So when I do that.

432
00:21:21.006 --> 00:21:21.466
>> Matches.

433
00:21:21.786 --> 00:21:22.136
Button.

434
00:21:22.376 --> 00:21:24.586
>> VoiceOver finds
the Matches button.

435
00:21:24.836 --> 00:21:28.936
If I swipe to the right one
more time we hear that sound,

436
00:21:28.936 --> 00:21:30.786
which means there's nothing
else after this element.

437
00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:32.216
Which is correct in this case.

438
00:21:32.886 --> 00:21:34.916
So it looks like this view
is in pretty good shape,

439
00:21:34.996 --> 00:21:36.276
except for the missing logo.

440
00:21:37.386 --> 00:21:39.306
Now, I'm going to
tap on profile.

441
00:21:40.176 --> 00:21:41.396
>> Profile button.

442
00:21:41.396 --> 00:21:43.646
>> And I'm going to
double tap to activate it.

443
00:21:43.696 --> 00:21:46.896
>> Profile, Profile,
Back, Back button.

444
00:21:47.206 --> 00:21:48.616
>> Let's swipe to
the right a few times

445
00:21:48.776 --> 00:21:50.066
to see what VoiceOver sees.

446
00:21:51.276 --> 00:21:51.916
>> Profile.

447
00:21:52.186 --> 00:21:53.846
Heading. Your age.

448
00:21:54.586 --> 00:21:55.476
19 percent.

449
00:21:55.756 --> 00:21:56.276
Adjustable.

450
00:21:57.446 --> 00:21:59.446
Swipe up or down with one
finger to adjust the value.

451
00:21:59.446 --> 00:22:01.806
>> So that was a little strange.

452
00:21:59.446 --> 00:22:01.806
>> So that was a little strange.

453
00:22:02.186 --> 00:22:06.076
We just heard "your age,"
followed by "19 percent,"

454
00:22:06.366 --> 00:22:07.886
it would make a lot more sense

455
00:22:08.046 --> 00:22:11.086
if VoiceOver said the age
here, which is actually 37.

456
00:22:11.576 --> 00:22:13.356
And the instructions
said to swipe up

457
00:22:13.356 --> 00:22:14.676
or down to adjust the value.

458
00:22:14.856 --> 00:22:16.496
So if I swipe up,
watch what happens.

459
00:22:17.226 --> 00:22:17.996
>> 28 percent.

460
00:22:19.146 --> 00:22:20.766
>> My age is jumping
up by 10 years.

461
00:22:21.266 --> 00:22:23.786
So it doesn't look like
VoiceOver users will be able

462
00:22:23.786 --> 00:22:27.276
to set their age accurately
right now in our app.

463
00:22:27.346 --> 00:22:29.326
Now, I'm going to swipe to
the right a few more times

464
00:22:29.616 --> 00:22:30.836
to see what else VoiceOver sees.

465
00:22:31.766 --> 00:22:33.896
>> 47. Hobbies.

466
00:22:34.596 --> 00:22:35.816
Music. Swing dance.

467
00:22:36.096 --> 00:22:37.286
Wine. Text field.

468
00:22:38.416 --> 00:22:39.166
Double tap to edit.

469
00:22:39.726 --> 00:22:40.316
>> Let's make sure

470
00:22:40.316 --> 00:22:42.226
that VoiceOver users
can edit their hobbies.

471
00:22:42.366 --> 00:22:44.546
So I'm going to double tap.

472
00:22:44.756 --> 00:22:46.186
>> Text field is editing.

473
00:22:46.466 --> 00:22:47.566
Music. Swing dance.

474
00:22:47.846 --> 00:22:48.196
Wine.

475
00:22:49.116 --> 00:22:50.026
>> And the keyboard came up.

476
00:22:50.186 --> 00:22:52.996
So that looks like VoiceOver
users will be able to do that.

477
00:22:53.616 --> 00:22:55.916
Let's just make sure that the
Done button, which appeared

478
00:22:55.916 --> 00:22:58.266
in the top right, is also
visible to VoiceOver.

479
00:22:58.466 --> 00:22:59.926
So I'll tap on that.

480
00:22:59.926 --> 00:23:00.776
>> Done button.

481
00:22:59.926 --> 00:23:00.776
>> Done button.

482
00:23:00.866 --> 00:23:01.296
>> And it is.

483
00:23:01.296 --> 00:23:03.686
When I double tap.

484
00:23:04.036 --> 00:23:06.146
That takes us out of editing.

485
00:23:06.916 --> 00:23:09.006
So it looks like the
hobbies are in good shape.

486
00:23:09.386 --> 00:23:12.106
And the elevator pitch field
is very similar to hobbies,

487
00:23:12.206 --> 00:23:13.586
so we'll skip that for now.

488
00:23:13.806 --> 00:23:16.806
Now I'm going to touch on the
Preview tab at the bottom.

489
00:23:17.406 --> 00:23:18.016
>> Preview.

490
00:23:18.456 --> 00:23:21.596
>> So it's just saying
"preview,"

491
00:23:22.296 --> 00:23:25.826
and if I couldn't see the screen
with that visual indication

492
00:23:25.826 --> 00:23:29.226
of a tab, it might not be
clear to me what this does.

493
00:23:29.326 --> 00:23:32.366
I mean, I might try to double
tap it, and so when I do that --

494
00:23:33.026 --> 00:23:33.656
>> Preview.

495
00:23:34.176 --> 00:23:37.276
>> Nothing happens, because this
tab doesn't respond to a tap.

496
00:23:37.616 --> 00:23:39.646
It needs to have a
slide gesture up.

497
00:23:40.626 --> 00:23:43.396
So right now, VoiceOver users
cannot preview their profile.

498
00:23:43.396 --> 00:23:46.186
Now, I'm going to touch
on the back button.

499
00:23:46.376 --> 00:23:48.076
>> Back. Back button.

500
00:23:48.076 --> 00:23:49.826
>> And double tap.

501
00:23:50.416 --> 00:23:51.096
>> [Beeping sound]
HelloGoodbye, heading.

502
00:23:51.096 --> 00:23:53.566
>> I'm going to tap
on Matches now.

503
00:23:54.006 --> 00:23:55.166
>> Matches button.

504
00:23:55.196 --> 00:23:56.756
>> And double tap.

505
00:23:56.756 --> 00:23:59.306
>> Matches, Matches,
Back, Back button.

506
00:23:59.726 --> 00:24:02.086
>> Okay. Again we're going to
swipe to the right a few times

507
00:23:59.726 --> 00:24:02.086
>> Okay. Again we're going to
swipe to the right a few times

508
00:24:02.366 --> 00:24:03.566
to see what VoiceOver sees.

509
00:24:04.306 --> 00:24:04.846
>> Matches.

510
00:24:05.176 --> 00:24:07.936
Heading. Swipe up
arrow to say hello,

511
00:24:07.986 --> 00:24:09.206
swipe down arrow to say goodbye.

512
00:24:09.466 --> 00:24:09.876
Ellipses.

513
00:24:11.366 --> 00:24:12.896
>> Okay, that's also
a little strange.

514
00:24:13.256 --> 00:24:16.926
Visually when you look at
this logo, or this label,

515
00:24:16.926 --> 00:24:19.296
you see swipe up to say hello.

516
00:24:19.786 --> 00:24:22.806
But VoiceOver is saying
swipe up arrow to say hello.

517
00:24:22.866 --> 00:24:24.726
And that's because
VoiceOver is reading each

518
00:24:24.726 --> 00:24:26.046
of those characters literally.

519
00:24:26.046 --> 00:24:29.236
So it would be better if
VoiceOver described this

520
00:24:29.236 --> 00:24:30.216
in a more natural way.

521
00:24:31.436 --> 00:24:34.546
Now, let's swipe to the
right to get to the photo.

522
00:24:34.546 --> 00:24:34.806
>> Age.

523
00:24:35.486 --> 00:24:36.866
>> Except we didn't
get to the photo.

524
00:24:37.096 --> 00:24:40.956
So now let's try touching it
directly [beeping sounds].

525
00:24:41.356 --> 00:24:43.646
And again, I get that sound,

526
00:24:43.646 --> 00:24:45.636
which means VoiceOver doesn't
think there's a photo there.

527
00:24:46.466 --> 00:24:50.556
Now, some of you might be
wondering whether that's

528
00:24:50.556 --> 00:24:51.256
even important.

529
00:24:51.636 --> 00:24:55.376
Because after all, a VoiceOver
user doesn't see the photo,

530
00:24:55.376 --> 00:24:55.626
right?

531
00:24:56.146 --> 00:24:58.686
But it turns out
it is important,

532
00:24:59.126 --> 00:25:00.536
so for a couple of reasons.

533
00:24:59.126 --> 00:25:00.536
so for a couple of reasons.

534
00:25:01.346 --> 00:25:05.396
First, if I'm a VoiceOver user,
using this app, I need to know

535
00:25:05.816 --> 00:25:08.716
that other people in this
app can see my photo.

536
00:25:09.026 --> 00:25:11.146
Even if I don't take full
advantage of the photo,

537
00:25:11.486 --> 00:25:13.676
it's important to
know that it's there.

538
00:25:13.796 --> 00:25:14.976
And second, remember

539
00:25:14.976 --> 00:25:17.586
that Semantic Accessibility
is not just about VoiceOver.

540
00:25:17.836 --> 00:25:18.876
So it's always a good idea

541
00:25:18.876 --> 00:25:22.146
to expose any meaningful
info from your app.

542
00:25:23.326 --> 00:25:25.406
Okay, now I'm going
to touch on age again.

543
00:25:25.816 --> 00:25:25.906
>> Age.

544
00:25:26.056 --> 00:25:30.926
>> And I'm going to swipe
to the right a few times.

545
00:25:30.926 --> 00:25:31.276
>> Hobbies.

546
00:25:31.986 --> 00:25:33.646
32. Cooking.

547
00:25:33.856 --> 00:25:34.676
Bubble tea with friends.

548
00:25:34.936 --> 00:25:35.266
Travel.

549
00:25:36.246 --> 00:25:38.226
>> If you're paying
close attention,

550
00:25:38.226 --> 00:25:41.346
you may have noticed how
VoiceOver went from age

551
00:25:41.586 --> 00:25:43.786
to hobbies, and then back to 32.

552
00:25:44.716 --> 00:25:46.796
So when you're looking
at the visual layout

553
00:25:47.006 --> 00:25:49.336
of this profile card, it's
clear what this means,

554
00:25:49.856 --> 00:25:53.066
but VoiceOver users
are often swiping

555
00:25:53.196 --> 00:25:55.636
to visit different elements,
because that can be easier

556
00:25:55.636 --> 00:25:57.956
than touching exactly
where an element is.

557
00:25:58.636 --> 00:26:01.316
And so it's important
to have a logical order

558
00:25:58.636 --> 00:26:01.316
And so it's important
to have a logical order

559
00:26:01.666 --> 00:26:03.276
for how these elements
are visited.

560
00:26:03.716 --> 00:26:06.316
It's also important for
Switch Control users.

561
00:26:06.776 --> 00:26:10.036
The Switch Control cursor
will move from element

562
00:26:10.036 --> 00:26:11.576
to element in the same order.

563
00:26:12.376 --> 00:26:14.846
And it's important for that
order to be predictable,

564
00:26:14.846 --> 00:26:17.236
so that a Switch Control user
can activate their switch

565
00:26:17.236 --> 00:26:18.126
at the right time.

566
00:26:18.756 --> 00:26:24.416
Okay. So last thing, remember
that our second question was

567
00:26:24.736 --> 00:26:26.416
"Can VoiceOver do
everything that needs

568
00:26:26.416 --> 00:26:29.076
to be done in this app?"

569
00:26:29.596 --> 00:26:33.016
The point of the Matches page
is to allow users to say hello

570
00:26:33.176 --> 00:26:34.506
or goodbye to their matches.

571
00:26:35.586 --> 00:26:38.716
But VoiceOver users won't be
able to do this right now,

572
00:26:39.326 --> 00:26:43.026
because swipe gestures get
intercepted by VoiceOver,

573
00:26:43.206 --> 00:26:44.766
and we'll need to
provide a different way

574
00:26:44.996 --> 00:26:47.036
for VoiceOver users to
do the same actions.

575
00:26:47.036 --> 00:26:50.026
So that's the kind of process
you can take with your own app

576
00:26:50.176 --> 00:26:53.516
to see whether it is
semantically accessible.

577
00:26:53.926 --> 00:26:56.326
Now, let's look at resolving
those issues we encountered.

578
00:26:57.646 --> 00:26:59.486
First, I'm going to
introduce the most basic

579
00:26:59.486 --> 00:27:00.336
accessibility API.

580
00:26:59.486 --> 00:27:00.336
accessibility API.

581
00:27:01.046 --> 00:27:02.696
There are only 2
properties here,

582
00:27:03.036 --> 00:27:04.896
and if you remember
nothing else from this talk,

583
00:27:05.156 --> 00:27:06.476
please remember these 2.

584
00:27:07.116 --> 00:27:09.816
Just by using these 2
properties, you can solve a lot

585
00:27:09.816 --> 00:27:11.046
of accessibility issues.

586
00:27:11.506 --> 00:27:14.476
The most important
property you need

587
00:27:14.476 --> 00:27:17.606
to know is the
isAccessibilityElement property.

588
00:27:17.996 --> 00:27:19.366
This is a Boolean

589
00:27:19.366 --> 00:27:22.286
that determines whether a
view is visible to VoiceOver.

590
00:27:23.306 --> 00:27:26.876
By default, it returns yes
for standard UIKit controls

591
00:27:26.876 --> 00:27:29.376
and labels, which is why even
though we haven't done any

592
00:27:29.376 --> 00:27:31.566
Semantic Accessibility
work in our app yet,

593
00:27:32.336 --> 00:27:34.396
a lot of the text is
already visible to VoiceOver.

594
00:27:35.016 --> 00:27:38.626
And the second-most
important property you need

595
00:27:38.626 --> 00:27:41.376
to know is the
accessibilityLabel property.

596
00:27:41.956 --> 00:27:45.066
This describes a view, and
VoiceOver will speak this

597
00:27:45.496 --> 00:27:47.616
when a VoiceOver user
touches on a view.

598
00:27:48.196 --> 00:27:53.146
If you're creating your
views in Interface Builder,

599
00:27:53.516 --> 00:27:55.616
you can set these properties
directly from Xcode's UI.

600
00:27:56.146 --> 00:27:58.026
On the right-hand side of Xcode,

601
00:27:58.726 --> 00:28:00.306
you'll find an identity
inspector.

602
00:27:58.726 --> 00:28:00.306
you'll find an identity
inspector.

603
00:28:00.736 --> 00:28:02.666
And there's an accessibility
section there.

604
00:28:02.946 --> 00:28:06.706
The Accessibility enable
check box corresponds

605
00:28:06.746 --> 00:28:11.636
to isAccessibilityElement and
the label field corresponds

606
00:28:11.636 --> 00:28:12.706
to accessibilityLabel.

607
00:28:12.706 --> 00:28:18.506
If you're creating your views
in code, it's still really easy

608
00:28:18.506 --> 00:28:20.846
to set these properties
as shown here.

609
00:28:23.276 --> 00:28:26.616
So now let's look at
using these two properties

610
00:28:26.796 --> 00:28:30.556
and see how much more
accessible we can make our app.

611
00:28:30.556 --> 00:28:32.916
So the first thing we're
going to do is make sure

612
00:28:32.916 --> 00:28:35.746
that VoiceOver users can read
the logo on the first page.

613
00:28:36.536 --> 00:28:41.836
To do that, I'm going to go
click on the StartViewController

614
00:28:41.836 --> 00:28:44.766
on the left, which is
where we create that logo.

615
00:28:45.106 --> 00:28:46.906
So I'm going to click
on the drop-down

616
00:28:47.426 --> 00:28:49.016
and find our viewDidLoad method.

617
00:28:49.556 --> 00:28:51.336
So here's the logo.

618
00:28:51.696 --> 00:28:52.916
It's just an image
view right now.

619
00:28:54.076 --> 00:28:56.976
And first we're going to set
isAccessibilityElement to yes,

620
00:28:57.516 --> 00:28:58.676
so that VoiceOver can see it.

621
00:28:59.666 --> 00:29:02.136
And then we also need to make
sure VoiceOver describes it

622
00:28:59.666 --> 00:29:02.136
And then we also need to make
sure VoiceOver describes it

623
00:29:02.236 --> 00:29:04.996
correctly, so we give it
an accessibilityLabel.

624
00:29:05.226 --> 00:29:06.896
In this case, we're just going

625
00:29:06.896 --> 00:29:08.996
to give it the text
that's inside the logo.

626
00:29:10.276 --> 00:29:12.176
Notice also that we're
localizing the string,

627
00:29:12.636 --> 00:29:14.956
because VoiceOver
speaks in many languages.

628
00:29:15.196 --> 00:29:20.646
Next, let's make sure
that the photo that's

629
00:29:20.706 --> 00:29:23.426
in the profile card can
also be seen by VoiceOver.

630
00:29:23.866 --> 00:29:26.016
To do that, I'm going to click

631
00:29:26.016 --> 00:29:27.476
on the card view
clef on the left.

632
00:29:28.406 --> 00:29:30.396
And I'm going to open
the drop-down to find

633
00:29:30.456 --> 00:29:32.136
where we add our ProfileViews.

634
00:29:32.526 --> 00:29:34.936
So here's where we're
adding the photo.

635
00:29:35.656 --> 00:29:37.886
Again, we set
isAccessibilityElement to yes,

636
00:29:39.266 --> 00:29:41.426
and we give it an
appropriate accessibilityLabel.

637
00:29:41.806 --> 00:29:45.136
In this case, we're just going
to call it profile photo.

638
00:29:46.776 --> 00:29:50.046
Finally, let's look
at the instructions

639
00:29:50.046 --> 00:29:51.166
for saying hello or goodbye.

640
00:29:51.826 --> 00:29:55.366
Right now, VoiceOver is saying
swipe up arrow to say hello.

641
00:29:55.776 --> 00:29:57.426
Let's fix that.

642
00:29:57.426 --> 00:29:59.016
So to do that, I'm
going to click

643
00:29:59.076 --> 00:30:02.076
on the Matches View Controller
on the left, and we're going

644
00:29:59.076 --> 00:30:02.076
on the Matches View Controller
on the left, and we're going

645
00:30:02.076 --> 00:30:04.716
to open the drop-down
at the top to find

646
00:30:04.716 --> 00:30:06.916
where we add those
swiping instructions.

647
00:30:08.226 --> 00:30:10.866
So here's a label that
says those instructions.

648
00:30:11.976 --> 00:30:14.476
It's already in
accessibilityElement by default,

649
00:30:14.786 --> 00:30:17.286
so all we need to do is change
the accessibility label.

650
00:30:17.566 --> 00:30:20.596
We're going to give it one
that is just like the text

651
00:30:20.596 --> 00:30:23.776
on the label, except we're
replacing those unicode arrows

652
00:30:24.306 --> 00:30:25.106
with words.

653
00:30:25.786 --> 00:30:34.246
Now I'm going to build and run
the app with these changes.

654
00:30:34.756 --> 00:30:35.496
>> [Beeping sound]
Extras folder.

655
00:30:35.776 --> 00:30:39.896
Two apps. Double tap to
open [beeping sound].

656
00:30:40.026 --> 00:30:40.746
>> HelloGoodbye.

657
00:30:41.566 --> 00:30:42.276
Extras folder.

658
00:30:42.526 --> 00:30:49.686
Two apps. Double tap to open.

659
00:30:49.686 --> 00:30:50.346
Hello goodbye [beeping sound].

660
00:30:50.536 --> 00:30:54.216
>> So here's our app
again with these changes.

661
00:30:54.916 --> 00:30:57.296
The first thing I'm going
to do is touch the logo.

662
00:30:57.916 --> 00:30:58.826
>> HelloGoodbye.

663
00:30:58.886 --> 00:30:59.506
Meet your match.

664
00:30:59.816 --> 00:31:00.146
Image.

665
00:30:59.816 --> 00:31:00.146
Image.

666
00:31:00.956 --> 00:31:02.586
>> So now VoiceOver
users can read this.

667
00:31:02.766 --> 00:31:06.026
Next, I'm going to touch
on the Matches button.

668
00:31:06.446 --> 00:31:07.586
>> Matches button.

669
00:31:07.666 --> 00:31:09.546
>> And double tap.

670
00:31:10.276 --> 00:31:12.036
>> [Beeping sound]
Matches, Back, Back button.

671
00:31:12.726 --> 00:31:15.236
>> Let's first look at what
the instructions say right now.

672
00:31:16.216 --> 00:31:17.356
>> Swipe up to say hello.

673
00:31:17.556 --> 00:31:18.616
Swipe down to say goodbye.

674
00:31:19.206 --> 00:31:21.076
>> Okay, so that's much
easier to understand.

675
00:31:21.926 --> 00:31:23.356
And now when I swipe
to the right.

676
00:31:24.026 --> 00:31:25.536
>> Profile photo, image.

677
00:31:26.386 --> 00:31:28.686
>> VoiceOver is able to see
the photo in the profile.

678
00:31:29.276 --> 00:31:32.786
So that's how, even with
just these two properties,

679
00:31:33.016 --> 00:31:35.356
you've already made other
parts of our app accessible.

680
00:31:35.846 --> 00:31:40.386
But because we've got some
more custom UI in our app,

681
00:31:40.386 --> 00:31:42.446
there's some additional
API we'll need to use

682
00:31:42.616 --> 00:31:44.896
to give VoiceOver users a
really great experience.

683
00:31:45.476 --> 00:31:51.076
First, I'd like to introduce the
concept of Accessibility Traits.

684
00:31:51.666 --> 00:31:53.736
Traits describe the
function of a view.

685
00:31:54.986 --> 00:31:58.726
For example, in the familiar
timer app, each of the wheels

686
00:31:58.726 --> 00:32:01.846
of time has a trait
of adjustable.

687
00:31:58.726 --> 00:32:01.846
of time has a trait
of adjustable.

688
00:32:02.016 --> 00:32:05.656
And that means that its value
can be changed up or down.

689
00:32:06.496 --> 00:32:09.296
The Start button has
a trait of button.

690
00:32:09.646 --> 00:32:12.286
And that gives the user a
hint that this is something

691
00:32:12.286 --> 00:32:13.226
that can be activated.

692
00:32:13.666 --> 00:32:19.236
Again, if you're creating your
views in Interface Builder,

693
00:32:19.336 --> 00:32:22.316
it's really easy to set these
traits directly from Xcode's UI.

694
00:32:23.216 --> 00:32:24.846
In the same section we
talked about earlier,

695
00:32:25.176 --> 00:32:27.456
you'll see a bunch of
check boxes for traits.

696
00:32:28.246 --> 00:32:30.066
Some of these check boxes
may already be checked,

697
00:32:30.446 --> 00:32:33.316
in which case I would generally
recommend leaving those alone,

698
00:32:33.526 --> 00:32:35.776
but add check boxes
next to traits

699
00:32:35.776 --> 00:32:37.516
that you think are
important for your view.

700
00:32:38.086 --> 00:32:42.496
In code, it's also
straightforward

701
00:32:42.766 --> 00:32:44.136
to set the Accessibility Traits.

702
00:32:44.526 --> 00:32:47.476
But just remember that it is
a bit mask, so if you want

703
00:32:47.576 --> 00:32:50.766
to add a trait in addition
to others, use a bitwise

704
00:32:50.826 --> 00:32:54.716
or operator, as shown
here, to combine them.

705
00:32:57.396 --> 00:33:00.326
Next, let's talk about
Accessibility Value.

706
00:32:57.396 --> 00:33:00.326
Next, let's talk about
Accessibility Value.

707
00:33:00.816 --> 00:33:04.316
Accessibility Value is a string
on properties, so in that way,

708
00:33:04.316 --> 00:33:06.116
it's similar to accessibility
label.

709
00:33:06.706 --> 00:33:08.506
Except you use Accessibility
Value

710
00:33:08.506 --> 00:33:09.726
for things that are dynamic.

711
00:33:10.766 --> 00:33:12.846
For example, you
use this on views

712
00:33:12.846 --> 00:33:16.056
that have the adjustable trait
to describe the numerical value.

713
00:33:17.246 --> 00:33:21.006
Right now, in our app, the age
slider has an Accessibility

714
00:33:21.006 --> 00:33:22.706
Value of 19 percent.

715
00:33:23.276 --> 00:33:26.426
So that's a case where we can
override Accessibility Value

716
00:33:26.726 --> 00:33:28.116
to return the age instead.

717
00:33:31.936 --> 00:33:33.796
Next, we'll talk about actions.

718
00:33:34.046 --> 00:33:38.236
So actions are how VoiceOver
can control your app.

719
00:33:38.486 --> 00:33:42.356
Two really common ones are the
Increment and Decrement actions.

720
00:33:42.666 --> 00:33:45.196
So these are actions that
are associated specifically

721
00:33:45.376 --> 00:33:47.096
for views that have
the adjustable trait.

722
00:33:47.096 --> 00:33:49.556
And they allow the
user to increase

723
00:33:49.556 --> 00:33:51.276
or decrease an element's value.

724
00:33:51.736 --> 00:33:56.146
So again, in our app, the
age slider right now can be

725
00:33:56.256 --> 00:33:57.476
incremented or decremented,

726
00:33:57.716 --> 00:33:59.676
but right now it's
doing that by 10 years.

727
00:34:00.786 --> 00:34:03.726
We can override these
methods to allow the user

728
00:34:03.726 --> 00:34:05.316
to change their age
by a single year.

729
00:34:08.735 --> 00:34:12.076
Another really important
action is the Activate action,

730
00:34:12.116 --> 00:34:14.186
and that's what happens
when a user double taps.

731
00:34:15.226 --> 00:34:16.866
Normally, when you
double tap something,

732
00:34:16.866 --> 00:34:18.045
that just taps the view.

733
00:34:18.876 --> 00:34:21.815
But you can override this
method on views that respond

734
00:34:21.815 --> 00:34:24.916
to a specific gesture, and
that way VoiceOver users can do

735
00:34:24.916 --> 00:34:26.366
that action as well easily.

736
00:34:26.806 --> 00:34:29.726
For example, in our app, we can
use this for the Preview tab,

737
00:34:30.156 --> 00:34:32.436
which currently only
responds to a sliding gesture.

738
00:34:32.866 --> 00:34:38.156
And finally, we have
notifications,

739
00:34:38.335 --> 00:34:40.025
which allow your app
to tell VoiceOver

740
00:34:40.025 --> 00:34:41.056
when something has changed.

741
00:34:41.916 --> 00:34:43.985
One really important
notification is

742
00:34:44.106 --> 00:34:45.485
the LayoutChangeNotification.

743
00:34:46.156 --> 00:34:50.576
You should send this when you're
changing the layout of your app,

744
00:34:50.576 --> 00:34:52.326
for example, adding
or removing views.

745
00:34:52.886 --> 00:34:55.616
For example, in our
app right now,

746
00:34:55.616 --> 00:34:59.866
when you reveal the preview,
VoiceOver might not realize

747
00:34:59.866 --> 00:35:02.986
that new elements
have come on screen.

748
00:34:59.866 --> 00:35:02.986
that new elements
have come on screen.

749
00:35:03.146 --> 00:35:06.616
Once you post a layout change
notification, VoiceOver checks

750
00:35:06.616 --> 00:35:09.386
to find the elements
that are there currently.

751
00:35:12.896 --> 00:35:15.766
Now, let's put all this
together in our sample app

752
00:35:15.766 --> 00:35:17.876
to resolve some more of
those issues we encountered.

753
00:35:18.106 --> 00:35:19.906
So the first thing we're
going to do is make sure

754
00:35:19.906 --> 00:35:22.446
that VoiceOver users
can edit their age.

755
00:35:23.466 --> 00:35:26.466
To do that, I'm going
to go to Xcode and click

756
00:35:26.466 --> 00:35:30.866
on the AgeSlider
class on the left.

757
00:35:30.866 --> 00:35:33.166
Here let's override
accessibilityValue,

758
00:35:33.326 --> 00:35:36.906
and that way we can return the
age instead of a percentage.

759
00:35:37.486 --> 00:35:39.806
All we're doing is taking
the value of the slider,

760
00:35:39.886 --> 00:35:45.016
which corresponds to the age,
and making it into a string.

761
00:35:45.136 --> 00:35:48.096
Next, let's make sure that
VoiceOver users can add

762
00:35:48.456 --> 00:35:51.776
or remove to their
age by a single year.

763
00:35:52.626 --> 00:35:55.266
So to do that, let's override
accessibilityIncrement.

764
00:35:56.196 --> 00:35:59.066
All we're doing here is adding
1 to the slider's value.

765
00:35:59.786 --> 00:36:02.286
We also send the Value
Change Control Event,

766
00:35:59.786 --> 00:36:02.286
We also send the Value
Change Control Event,

767
00:36:02.716 --> 00:36:05.396
that way other parts
of our UI that rely

768
00:36:05.396 --> 00:36:07.636
on the slider's value
can update accordingly.

769
00:36:08.236 --> 00:36:12.576
We do the same thing for
accessibilityDecrement.

770
00:36:13.026 --> 00:36:16.146
And now, one nuance to this.

771
00:36:16.356 --> 00:36:21.296
After these changes, our age
slider has all the information

772
00:36:21.296 --> 00:36:22.386
that the user needs to know.

773
00:36:22.576 --> 00:36:23.896
Namely, the user's age.

774
00:36:24.856 --> 00:36:27.206
So from a Semantic
Accessibility standpoint,

775
00:36:27.806 --> 00:36:31.236
that label that's showing up
next to the slider is redundant,

776
00:36:31.676 --> 00:36:33.186
and might even be confusing.

777
00:36:34.086 --> 00:36:36.126
So let's just hide it.

778
00:36:37.196 --> 00:36:40.136
To do that, I'm going to click
on the Profile View Controller

779
00:36:40.136 --> 00:36:43.586
on the left, and open
the drop-down to find

780
00:36:43.586 --> 00:36:45.006
where we add that label.

781
00:36:47.836 --> 00:36:54.546
To hide it, we simply set
isAccessibilityElement to no.

782
00:36:54.546 --> 00:36:56.656
Okay. Next, let's make sure

783
00:36:56.656 --> 00:36:58.956
that VoiceOver users can
preview their profiles.

784
00:36:59.666 --> 00:37:03.746
To do that, let's go
in Xcode and click

785
00:36:59.666 --> 00:37:03.746
To do that, let's go
in Xcode and click

786
00:37:03.776 --> 00:37:06.246
on our PreviewLabel class.

787
00:37:06.836 --> 00:37:08.496
So here's our roadmap for this.

788
00:37:09.396 --> 00:37:11.666
We're going to override
accessibilityActivate

789
00:37:11.856 --> 00:37:14.626
on the Preview Label, so that
we can control what happens

790
00:37:14.626 --> 00:37:16.166
when the user double taps.

791
00:37:16.566 --> 00:37:18.866
But we need to tell the
Profile View Controller

792
00:37:19.226 --> 00:37:20.446
to show or hide the preview.

793
00:37:20.446 --> 00:37:23.526
So we'll need a way
to communicate that.

794
00:37:23.946 --> 00:37:27.446
To do that, let's set
up a delegate protocol.

795
00:37:27.976 --> 00:37:31.126
And all this delegate
protocol has is a single method

796
00:37:31.336 --> 00:37:33.606
that we're going to call when
the label gets activated.

797
00:37:33.956 --> 00:37:37.336
Of course, we also set
up a delegate property

798
00:37:37.786 --> 00:37:40.486
so that the View Controller
can set itself a delegate.

799
00:37:40.486 --> 00:37:43.906
Now let's go to the
implementation file.

800
00:37:44.466 --> 00:37:48.886
Here we're going to override
accessibilityActivate.

801
00:37:49.786 --> 00:37:52.376
All we're doing is
letting the delegate know

802
00:37:52.586 --> 00:37:56.086
that the label was activated,
and we return yes to indicate

803
00:37:56.086 --> 00:37:57.076
that the action succeeded.

804
00:37:57.586 --> 00:38:02.836
While we're here, let's
also add a button trait

805
00:37:57.586 --> 00:38:02.836
While we're here, let's
also add a button trait

806
00:38:02.896 --> 00:38:06.786
to the Preview Label, and that
way VoiceOver users will have a

807
00:38:06.786 --> 00:38:10.316
hint that they can
double tap to activate it.

808
00:38:10.856 --> 00:38:13.476
To do that, I'm going to
override accessibilityTraits,

809
00:38:14.576 --> 00:38:16.476
and first recalling super,

810
00:38:16.706 --> 00:38:18.276
to get any traits we
would have by default.

811
00:38:19.106 --> 00:38:22.846
Then we use the bitwise
or operator to combine

812
00:38:22.846 --> 00:38:23.776
that with a button trait.

813
00:38:24.476 --> 00:38:29.556
Okay. Now, let's go back to
our Profile View Controller,

814
00:38:30.046 --> 00:38:31.536
to implement the
delegate protocol.

815
00:38:32.066 --> 00:38:35.256
So first, I'm going to scroll
to the top of the file,

816
00:38:36.386 --> 00:38:38.716
and declare that this
view controller implements

817
00:38:38.716 --> 00:38:39.286
that protocol.

818
00:38:39.716 --> 00:38:45.336
Next, I'm going to open the
drop down and find where we add

819
00:38:45.336 --> 00:38:47.376
that Preview Label to the view.

820
00:38:48.856 --> 00:38:52.726
Here we set the View
Controller as its delegate.

821
00:38:53.806 --> 00:38:55.706
And finally, let's
implement that protocol.

822
00:38:55.976 --> 00:39:01.736
I'm going to scroll
to the bottom.

823
00:38:55.976 --> 00:39:01.736
I'm going to scroll
to the bottom.

824
00:39:01.886 --> 00:39:04.426
And here we've implemented the
only delegate protocol method

825
00:39:04.426 --> 00:39:04.696
we have.

826
00:39:05.796 --> 00:39:08.046
So when the Preview
Label is activated,

827
00:39:08.626 --> 00:39:11.116
we'll first check whether the
preview is currently showing.

828
00:39:11.766 --> 00:39:12.896
If it is, we can hide it.

829
00:39:13.646 --> 00:39:15.866
Otherwise, we reveal it.

830
00:39:16.956 --> 00:39:18.366
One additional thing.

831
00:39:19.006 --> 00:39:21.376
Recall that when you
hide or show the preview,

832
00:39:21.626 --> 00:39:23.206
you're changing the
layout of the screen.

833
00:39:23.486 --> 00:39:25.556
So we should tell VoiceOver
that that's happened.

834
00:39:26.496 --> 00:39:28.616
To do that, let's go
to the implementation

835
00:39:28.946 --> 00:39:30.926
of reveal card and dismiss card.

836
00:39:31.216 --> 00:39:32.726
So I'm going to click on
the drop down of the top

837
00:39:33.226 --> 00:39:34.426
and find those two methods.

838
00:39:35.036 --> 00:39:39.126
Both of these methods
are animating the card

839
00:39:39.126 --> 00:39:39.986
on or off screen.

840
00:39:40.996 --> 00:39:42.516
In the completion
for that animation,

841
00:39:43.536 --> 00:39:45.266
we post the layout
change notification.

842
00:39:45.726 --> 00:39:47.496
Let's do the same
thing down here

843
00:39:47.496 --> 00:39:51.746
when dismissing the preview.

844
00:39:52.196 --> 00:39:52.296
Okay.

845
00:39:53.176 --> 00:39:54.876
>> Now let's build
and run our app

846
00:39:54.876 --> 00:39:57.906
with these changes
[beeping sound].

847
00:39:58.706 --> 00:39:59.426
>> HelloGoodbye.

848
00:40:00.486 --> 00:40:02.696
>> Double tap to open.

849
00:40:02.696 --> 00:40:03.426
>> [beeping sound].

850
00:40:03.426 --> 00:40:04.126
>> Extras folder.

851
00:40:04.416 --> 00:40:06.896
Two apps. Double tap to open.

852
00:40:06.896 --> 00:40:07.816
HelloGoodbye.

853
00:40:07.816 --> 00:40:10.096
>> Okay, so here we are in
the app with our changes.

854
00:40:10.686 --> 00:40:12.446
First I'm going to tap
on the profile button.

855
00:40:12.976 --> 00:40:14.356
>> Profile button.

856
00:40:14.556 --> 00:40:16.006
>> And I'm going to
double tap to activate.

857
00:40:16.546 --> 00:40:19.376
>> Profile, Profile,
Back, Back button.

858
00:40:20.086 --> 00:40:21.916
>> First, let's touch
on the age slider.

859
00:40:22.796 --> 00:40:24.226
>> 37. Adjustable.

860
00:40:25.346 --> 00:40:27.456
Swipe up or down with one
finger to adjust the value.

861
00:40:27.666 --> 00:40:30.216
>> So notice how
that's much clearer.

862
00:40:30.216 --> 00:40:32.966
We're actually seeing the
age now, and when I swipe

863
00:40:33.016 --> 00:40:34.096
up to adjust the value.

864
00:40:34.816 --> 00:40:35.206
>> 38.

865
00:40:35.696 --> 00:40:36.936
>> It goes up by a single year.

866
00:40:37.946 --> 00:40:39.326
When I swipe to the right --

867
00:40:40.136 --> 00:40:40.756
>> Hobbies.

868
00:40:41.306 --> 00:40:42.276
>> Notice how we've skipped

869
00:40:42.276 --> 00:40:44.006
over that redundant
label to the right.

870
00:40:44.516 --> 00:40:47.566
Now, I'm going to touch
on the preview tab.

871
00:40:48.136 --> 00:40:49.206
>> Preview button.

872
00:40:50.146 --> 00:40:52.516
>> So this time, because
it says it's a button,

873
00:40:52.556 --> 00:40:54.246
I know I can do something
with this.

874
00:40:54.346 --> 00:40:55.186
So I'm going to double tap.

875
00:40:56.216 --> 00:40:56.816
>> Preview.

876
00:40:56.816 --> 00:40:59.066
>> And notice how
the preview appears.

877
00:40:59.276 --> 00:41:00.256
So when I swipe to the right.

878
00:40:59.276 --> 00:41:00.256
So when I swipe to the right.

879
00:41:00.576 --> 00:41:01.456
>> Profile photo.

880
00:41:01.776 --> 00:41:02.116
Image.

881
00:41:02.206 --> 00:41:04.116
>> I can see stuff
inside the preview.

882
00:41:05.106 --> 00:41:06.586
If I tap on preview again --

883
00:41:07.076 --> 00:41:08.166
>> Preview button.

884
00:41:08.166 --> 00:41:08.966
>> And double tap.

885
00:41:09.516 --> 00:41:10.416
>> Preview.

886
00:41:10.686 --> 00:41:12.966
>> That hides the preview, so
when I swipe to the right now,

887
00:41:13.036 --> 00:41:16.296
I hear that sound,
VoiceOver knows

888
00:41:16.296 --> 00:41:17.766
that the preview
has gone off screen.

889
00:41:18.176 --> 00:41:21.376
So that's how we can make
even custom UI accessible

890
00:41:21.376 --> 00:41:21.986
to VoiceOver.

891
00:41:24.516 --> 00:41:27.746
To resolve the last remaining
issues we encountered during our

892
00:41:27.746 --> 00:41:30.926
audit, we're going to use some
new API we've added in iOS 8.

893
00:41:31.416 --> 00:41:36.636
First, let's talk about the
UIAccessibilityContainer

894
00:41:36.636 --> 00:41:37.126
protocol.

895
00:41:37.486 --> 00:41:40.286
Some of you may already
realize that that isn't new,

896
00:41:40.386 --> 00:41:43.896
but we've updated it in iOS 8
to make it much easier to use.

897
00:41:44.836 --> 00:41:46.676
For those who aren't
familiar with this protocol,

898
00:41:47.516 --> 00:41:50.536
UIAccessibilityContainer
is a way to return a list

899
00:41:50.536 --> 00:41:52.276
of accessibility
elements from a view.

900
00:41:53.086 --> 00:41:56.156
You'll need to do this
if you have elements

901
00:41:56.156 --> 00:41:57.656
that don't correspond to views.

902
00:41:58.846 --> 00:42:02.086
For example, you might have
a view with a drawing in it,

903
00:41:58.846 --> 00:42:02.086
For example, you might have
a view with a drawing in it,

904
00:42:02.086 --> 00:42:03.706
and you might want
different parts of the drawing

905
00:42:03.906 --> 00:42:05.746
to be separate accessibility
elements.

906
00:42:06.366 --> 00:42:08.926
In that case, you would create
an accessibility element

907
00:42:08.926 --> 00:42:10.196
for each part of the drawing,

908
00:42:10.646 --> 00:42:13.936
and return those elements using
the UIAccessibilityContainer

909
00:42:13.936 --> 00:42:14.456
protocol.

910
00:42:15.106 --> 00:42:18.646
And you can see last year's
talk, for a great example of how

911
00:42:18.646 --> 00:42:20.466
to create your own elements.

912
00:42:21.656 --> 00:42:23.356
But what many people
don't realize is

913
00:42:23.356 --> 00:42:25.436
that this protocol
is also a great way

914
00:42:25.686 --> 00:42:28.266
to return existing elements
in a specific order.

915
00:42:28.646 --> 00:42:32.566
So for example, if
VoiceOver is navigating things

916
00:42:32.736 --> 00:42:35.156
in a different order
from what we want,

917
00:42:35.546 --> 00:42:38.266
we can use this protocol
to return those elements

918
00:42:38.446 --> 00:42:41.916
in the order that we want
VoiceOver to see them.

919
00:42:45.546 --> 00:42:47.076
And now for what's changed.

920
00:42:47.246 --> 00:42:49.896
So currently, in order
to use this protocol,

921
00:42:50.306 --> 00:42:52.836
there are three methods
you need to override.

922
00:42:53.276 --> 00:42:57.746
In iOS 8, there's a
single property called

923
00:42:57.746 --> 00:43:01.966
accessibilityElements, which
you can set to return a list

924
00:42:57.746 --> 00:43:01.966
accessibilityElements, which
you can set to return a list

925
00:43:01.966 --> 00:43:04.436
of those elements, and
notice how now you don't need

926
00:43:04.436 --> 00:43:07.536
to override subclass, and
you don't have to deal

927
00:43:07.536 --> 00:43:08.606
with three separate methods.

928
00:43:08.846 --> 00:43:11.706
So we think people are going to
find that much easier to use.

929
00:43:11.706 --> 00:43:12.466
[Applause]Thank you.

930
00:43:13.166 --> 00:43:20.046
Okay next up we're
introducing a new class called

931
00:43:20.046 --> 00:43:20.946
the CustomAction.

932
00:43:21.436 --> 00:43:24.706
You should use CustomActions
when you have more

933
00:43:24.706 --> 00:43:26.926
than one action for an element.

934
00:43:27.496 --> 00:43:30.176
For example, in the
app switcher,

935
00:43:30.176 --> 00:43:32.546
each of the app thumbnails
can either be tapped

936
00:43:33.256 --> 00:43:38.206
to launch the app, or you can
slide it up to close the app.

937
00:43:38.456 --> 00:43:41.506
And so we expose a CustomAction
for closing the app,

938
00:43:41.906 --> 00:43:44.526
and that way VoiceOver users
can do that action easily

939
00:43:44.776 --> 00:43:46.356
without needing to do
the sliding gesture.

940
00:43:46.356 --> 00:43:50.706
In our sample app, we
can also use this API

941
00:43:51.306 --> 00:43:53.566
to allow VoiceOver
users to say hello

942
00:43:53.566 --> 00:43:54.856
or goodbye to their matches.

943
00:43:55.396 --> 00:44:00.216
The custom matching
class looks like this.

944
00:43:55.396 --> 00:44:00.216
The custom matching
class looks like this.

945
00:44:00.816 --> 00:44:03.436
You create a custom
action object with a name

946
00:44:03.976 --> 00:44:05.896
that VoiceOver uses
to describe it.

947
00:44:06.206 --> 00:44:08.426
And you also give it a
target and a selector,

948
00:44:08.636 --> 00:44:11.116
so similar to what you
would pass to a UI button.

949
00:44:11.396 --> 00:44:14.236
And that determines what happens
when the action is performed.

950
00:44:14.696 --> 00:44:18.446
Once you've created all of
your CustomAction objects,

951
00:44:19.106 --> 00:44:20.946
you can assign them
to a view using the

952
00:44:20.946 --> 00:44:23.666
accessibilityCustomActions
array property.

953
00:44:24.276 --> 00:44:30.196
So now, let's use this in our
app to fix the remaining issues.

954
00:44:30.796 --> 00:44:33.406
First, what we're going
to do is make sure

955
00:44:33.406 --> 00:44:35.656
that VoiceOver navigates
the views

956
00:44:35.816 --> 00:44:38.226
in the profile card
in the correct order.

957
00:44:38.816 --> 00:44:40.496
Namely, we don't want
it to go from age

958
00:44:40.496 --> 00:44:42.106
to hobbies and back to 32.

959
00:44:42.106 --> 00:44:49.506
So to fix that, let's click on
the card view class on the left.

960
00:44:49.606 --> 00:44:51.846
Here's our method where we
add all the profile views.

961
00:44:52.426 --> 00:44:53.526
When I scroll to the bottom,

962
00:44:54.846 --> 00:44:57.436
after all of our subviews
have been created,

963
00:44:57.916 --> 00:45:00.266
we can set the
accessibilityElement property

964
00:44:57.916 --> 00:45:00.266
we can set the
accessibilityElement property

965
00:45:00.266 --> 00:45:03.516
of our card view to an
array of its subviews

966
00:45:03.556 --> 00:45:04.946
in the order you
want them to appear.

967
00:45:05.816 --> 00:45:09.756
Notice how I put the age title
right next to the age value.

968
00:45:11.496 --> 00:45:14.036
Whoops. Okay.

969
00:45:14.576 --> 00:45:19.176
Next let's make sure that
VoiceOver users can say hello

970
00:45:19.176 --> 00:45:20.236
or goodbye to their matches.

971
00:45:20.676 --> 00:45:23.576
To do that, I'm going to click

972
00:45:23.576 --> 00:45:26.266
on the Matches View
Controller on the left.

973
00:45:26.636 --> 00:45:29.856
First, let's find out what we're
doing when a user swipes up

974
00:45:29.856 --> 00:45:31.676
or down without VoiceOver
enabled.

975
00:45:31.946 --> 00:45:34.656
So I'm going to click
on the drop down

976
00:45:34.916 --> 00:45:37.756
and find our swipe gesture
recognizer handlers.

977
00:45:39.336 --> 00:45:41.686
So both of these handlers
are simply calling

978
00:45:41.686 --> 00:45:44.976
in to methods called say
hello and say goodbye,

979
00:45:45.486 --> 00:45:47.826
which are implemented
right above.

980
00:45:48.346 --> 00:45:52.056
These methods are also great
candidates for the selector

981
00:45:52.056 --> 00:45:54.776
that we pass to the
CustomAction objects.

982
00:45:55.646 --> 00:45:58.046
The only thing we'll need
to change is make sure

983
00:45:58.046 --> 00:45:59.406
that they return Booleans

984
00:45:59.446 --> 00:46:01.406
to indicate whether
the action succeeded.

985
00:45:59.446 --> 00:46:01.406
to indicate whether
the action succeeded.

986
00:46:01.906 --> 00:46:04.526
In most cases, you
can just return yes.

987
00:46:05.436 --> 00:46:06.646
Oh, one more thing.

988
00:46:07.746 --> 00:46:11.436
When you say hello or goodbye
to a match, the layout changes.

989
00:46:12.026 --> 00:46:14.656
So again, we're going to post
a layout change notification.

990
00:46:15.326 --> 00:46:17.006
Both of these methods
are calling

991
00:46:17.006 --> 00:46:19.566
in to a helper called
animateCardsForHello,

992
00:46:19.636 --> 00:46:21.526
which is implemented
right above.

993
00:46:21.876 --> 00:46:26.186
So in the completion
for this animation,

994
00:46:27.396 --> 00:46:29.686
we should post our
layoutChangedNotification.

995
00:46:30.216 --> 00:46:32.756
Okay. So that's all
the setup we need.

996
00:46:33.116 --> 00:46:35.326
Now, let's create those
CustomAction objects.

997
00:46:36.146 --> 00:46:40.406
I'm going to click on the
drop down at the top and find

998
00:46:40.406 --> 00:46:42.596
where we add the card
to the Matches page.

999
00:46:42.706 --> 00:46:45.946
So here's where we're
creating the card,

1000
00:46:47.036 --> 00:46:50.566
and we're assigning swipe
gesture recognizers to it.

1001
00:46:51.796 --> 00:46:53.886
Alongside those swipe
gesture recognizers,

1002
00:46:54.226 --> 00:46:55.846
let's now create
our CustomActions.

1003
00:46:56.306 --> 00:46:58.466
First, I'm going to create
an action for saying hello.

1004
00:46:59.106 --> 00:47:02.566
So here's how that looks.

1005
00:46:59.106 --> 00:47:02.566
So here's how that looks.

1006
00:47:03.156 --> 00:47:05.936
We give it a name, which in
this case is simply say hello.

1007
00:47:06.746 --> 00:47:10.906
We pass in the View Controller
as a target, and as a selector,

1008
00:47:10.906 --> 00:47:13.036
we pass in the method
that we just modified

1009
00:47:13.036 --> 00:47:13.916
to return a Boolean.

1010
00:47:14.516 --> 00:47:17.646
We do the same thing
for saying goodbye.

1011
00:47:18.306 --> 00:47:22.476
And now, we want the user
to be able to say hello

1012
00:47:22.476 --> 00:47:25.856
or goodbye wherever they
are in the profile card.

1013
00:47:26.106 --> 00:47:29.596
So for every element
in the card view,

1014
00:47:29.876 --> 00:47:32.696
we're going to set it's
accessibilityCustomActions

1015
00:47:32.696 --> 00:47:35.436
property to an array
of these two actions.

1016
00:47:36.016 --> 00:47:40.976
Okay. Now, let's build and
run with these changes.

1017
00:47:41.516 --> 00:47:51.726

00:47:58.566 --> 00:47:59.736
>> Okay. Let's tap on Matches.

1022
00:48:00.206 --> 00:48:01.006
>> Matches button.

1023
00:48:01.046 --> 00:48:03.676
>> And double tap to activate.

1024
00:48:03.676 --> 00:48:04.036
>> [Beeping sound] Matches.

1025
00:48:04.426 --> 00:48:05.386
Matches. Back.

1026
00:48:05.696 --> 00:48:06.456
Back button.

1027
00:48:06.606 --> 00:48:09.476
>> So the first thing I'm going
to do is tap on the photo,

1028
00:48:09.776 --> 00:48:10.966
and start swiping to the right

1029
00:48:11.096 --> 00:48:13.626
to see what order VoiceOver
sees these elements.

1030
00:48:14.796 --> 00:48:15.706
>> Profile photo.

1031
00:48:16.006 --> 00:48:17.296
Image. Age.

1032
00:48:17.736 --> 00:48:19.346
32. Hobbies.

1033
00:48:19.946 --> 00:48:21.436
Cooking. Bubble tea
with friends.

1034
00:48:21.696 --> 00:48:22.026
Travel.

1035
00:48:22.536 --> 00:48:24.536
>> So that's much
easier to understand.

1036
00:48:24.776 --> 00:48:28.506
Next, let's touch any
element in the profile card.

1037
00:48:28.736 --> 00:48:30.526
In this case, I'm going
to touch on the photo.

1038
00:48:30.846 --> 00:48:31.896
And listen to what it says.

1039
00:48:32.396 --> 00:48:33.266
>> Profile photo.

1040
00:48:33.586 --> 00:48:36.706
Image. Swipe up or down
to select a CustomAction.

1041
00:48:37.166 --> 00:48:38.996
>> So we're given the
option to choose one

1042
00:48:38.996 --> 00:48:40.246
of the actions we created.

1043
00:48:40.726 --> 00:48:41.596
When I swipe down --

1044
00:48:42.056 --> 00:48:42.726
>> Say hello.

1045
00:48:43.716 --> 00:48:45.256
>> I hear the description
of the action.

1046
00:48:45.646 --> 00:48:49.046
If I want to take that action, I
can double tap, [clicking sound]

1047
00:48:49.486 --> 00:48:52.856
and so now VoiceOver
users can also say hello

1048
00:48:52.856 --> 00:48:54.086
or goodbye to their matches.

1049
00:48:54.236 --> 00:48:56.826
And that's how easy it is

1050
00:48:56.826 --> 00:48:59.106
to use the new API
we've added in iOS 8.

1051
00:49:00.516 --> 00:49:06.546
[ Applause ]

1052
00:49:07.046 --> 00:49:08.846
>> So we've come to
the end of our talk,

1053
00:49:08.916 --> 00:49:10.776
and there are a few
takeaways I'd like you

1054
00:49:10.776 --> 00:49:13.526
to have when you leave.

1055
00:49:14.066 --> 00:49:16.586
First, iOS users are diverse.

1056
00:49:16.936 --> 00:49:19.556
Keep in mind that there
may be users of your app

1057
00:49:19.986 --> 00:49:22.286
who have different needs,
which you should accommodate.

1058
00:49:23.166 --> 00:49:27.766
When you accommodate more users,
you're widening your user base.

1059
00:49:28.196 --> 00:49:31.186
When more people can use
your app, more people will.

1060
00:49:31.726 --> 00:49:33.836
And finally,

1061
00:49:33.836 --> 00:49:39.516
adding accessibility is a low
effort, high reward business.

1062
00:49:39.756 --> 00:49:42.666
We've just seen how, with only a
few code changes, we took an app

1063
00:49:43.086 --> 00:49:45.306
that was just unusable
for many users,

1064
00:49:45.306 --> 00:49:47.886
and made it into an experience
that they, too, can enjoy.

1065
00:49:49.336 --> 00:49:52.116
So without needing
a lot of work,

1066
00:49:52.116 --> 00:49:54.266
you can make a real
difference to users.

1067
00:49:55.446 --> 00:50:00.536
For more information, you
can contact our Evangelist,

1068
00:49:55.446 --> 00:50:00.536
For more information, you
can contact our Evangelist,

1069
00:50:00.626 --> 00:50:04.146
Jake Behrens, or you can consult
the Accessibility Programming

1070
00:50:04.146 --> 00:50:04.796
Guide for iOS.

1071
00:50:05.876 --> 00:50:07.336
There is also the
developer forums.

1072
00:50:07.566 --> 00:50:09.416
So you can ask other
developers your questions.

1073
00:50:09.866 --> 00:50:13.866
There are several related
sessions to this one.

1074
00:50:14.476 --> 00:50:16.166
Prior to this talk,
we had a talk

1075
00:50:16.166 --> 00:50:17.586
about accessibility on OS X.

1076
00:50:17.726 --> 00:50:19.626
If you missed it, you
can watch the video.

1077
00:50:20.096 --> 00:50:23.886
Tomorrow there will be a talk
about designing apps for people

1078
00:50:23.886 --> 00:50:25.166
on the autistic spectrum.

1079
00:50:25.346 --> 00:50:27.936
And on Friday, you can learn how

1080
00:50:27.936 --> 00:50:30.746
to make even complex web
applications accessible.

1081
00:50:32.396 --> 00:50:33.346
Thank you all for coming.

1082
00:50:33.526 --> 00:50:34.576
I hope you enjoyed the talk.

1083
00:50:34.926 --> 00:50:36.576
And have a great rest
of the conference.

1084
00:50:37.508 --> 00:50:39.508
