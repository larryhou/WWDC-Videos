1
00:00:12.626 --> 00:00:12.976
>> Welcome.

2
00:00:13.516 --> 00:00:18.546
[ Applause ]

3
00:00:19.046 --> 00:00:20.546
So welcome to "Ingredients
of Great Games".

4
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:23.606
What we're going to talk
about today is some things

5
00:00:23.636 --> 00:00:27.176
that you can do in your game to
make it really, really great.

6
00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:30.876
Because having a fun game
is simply not enough.

7
00:00:31.956 --> 00:00:34.236
There are things
that great games do.

8
00:00:34.526 --> 00:00:37.826
What I mean is, games that are
recognized as industry leading

9
00:00:38.376 --> 00:00:39.286
in the games industry.

10
00:00:39.286 --> 00:00:40.926
Things that they do
that you should be doing

11
00:00:41.056 --> 00:00:44.106
or what you really need to be
doing to make your game great.

12
00:00:44.106 --> 00:00:46.726
And there's a massive
opportunity.

13
00:00:47.396 --> 00:00:48.786
As Tim talked about yesterday,

14
00:00:48.786 --> 00:00:53.276
there's 75 billion
downloads of applications.

15
00:00:53.276 --> 00:00:55.446
And as everyone in
this room knows,

16
00:00:55.446 --> 00:00:58.246
a huge portion of
those are games.

17
00:00:59.886 --> 00:01:01.586
Game Center also reinforces this

18
00:00:59.886 --> 00:01:01.586
Game Center also reinforces this

19
00:01:01.586 --> 00:01:06.436
with 130 million monthly
active users last month.

20
00:01:06.476 --> 00:01:10.456
That is a huge audience that
you can tap into for your game.

21
00:01:11.516 --> 00:01:13.856
But, and to do that, you need
to start with a great idea,

22
00:01:14.586 --> 00:01:18.826
obviously put in hard work, and
you need to follow some really,

23
00:01:18.826 --> 00:01:21.976
really important key tips
to make your game great.

24
00:01:23.486 --> 00:01:26.216
So over the last couple days,
yesterday and this morning,

25
00:01:26.216 --> 00:01:27.766
we've been talking
about technology.

26
00:01:28.846 --> 00:01:32.286
And so technology like OpenGL
ES 3.0, which was introduced

27
00:01:32.286 --> 00:01:37.566
since WWDC last year, and is
the most advanced OpenGL ES

28
00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:38.226
out there.

29
00:01:38.706 --> 00:01:43.456
We also have Metal, our low
level highly optimized GPU API.

30
00:01:44.216 --> 00:01:45.646
We have Game Center,
which provides

31
00:01:45.876 --> 00:01:47.636
that social connection
for your players.

32
00:01:48.546 --> 00:01:49.726
SpriteKit and SceneKit.

33
00:01:50.606 --> 00:01:52.306
You know, let us do the
heavy lifting for you.

34
00:01:52.656 --> 00:01:55.506
If you don't need to go
right to OpenGL or Metal,

35
00:01:55.596 --> 00:01:56.956
you can use SpriteKit
and SceneKit.

36
00:01:57.466 --> 00:02:00.876
It'll allow you to do less
programming and let us build

37
00:01:57.466 --> 00:02:00.876
It'll allow you to do less
programming and let us build

38
00:02:00.876 --> 00:02:02.736
out efficient API
underneath your game.

39
00:02:03.296 --> 00:02:06.956
And Game Controllers: open your
game up to many forms of input.

40
00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:12.186
Of course, there's also Xcode
6 with Swift and Playground.

41
00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:18.956
We have tools like the
Metal or OpenGL Debuggers.

42
00:02:19.796 --> 00:02:22.246
We have SceneKit and
SpriteKit editors.

43
00:02:23.206 --> 00:02:25.216
And, also this week,
we have a mass amount

44
00:02:25.216 --> 00:02:26.906
of sessions about games.

45
00:02:26.906 --> 00:02:31.736
We have three on Metal, two
on SceneKit, two on SpriteKit.

46
00:02:31.736 --> 00:02:34.666
We have labs on all of
these technologies all week,

47
00:02:34.666 --> 00:02:37.456
and we have sessions
about developer tools.

48
00:02:38.296 --> 00:02:40.936
But technology alone
is not enough.

49
00:02:41.406 --> 00:02:44.076
You can't just take the
technology, build a game on top

50
00:02:44.076 --> 00:02:45.426
of it, and expect
it to be successful.

51
00:02:45.886 --> 00:02:49.606
You have to go about the games
business and the business

52
00:02:49.606 --> 00:02:52.386
of building a game with the
same passion that you would go

53
00:02:52.386 --> 00:02:53.546
about your game design

54
00:02:53.856 --> 00:02:56.576
or choosing your technology
or your graphics API.

55
00:02:58.136 --> 00:02:59.926
If you look at the winners

56
00:02:59.926 --> 00:03:03.976
from the Apple Design Awards
last night, like "Threes",

57
00:02:59.926 --> 00:03:03.976
from the Apple Design Awards
last night, like "Threes",

58
00:03:04.226 --> 00:03:08.656
"Leo's Fortune", "DEVICE 6",
"Blek", or "Monument Valley",

59
00:03:08.906 --> 00:03:11.036
they have some common
traits that attract,

60
00:03:11.776 --> 00:03:14.576
engage and retain their players.

61
00:03:14.786 --> 00:03:16.736
And this engagement
is key to success.

62
00:03:17.646 --> 00:03:22.256
So what we find are there are
some common threads among these

63
00:03:22.296 --> 00:03:23.196
successful games.

64
00:03:23.196 --> 00:03:26.606
Things like, make it easy
to buy and play your game

65
00:03:26.856 --> 00:03:28.436
by reducing the friction.

66
00:03:29.436 --> 00:03:34.336
Or refresh your content to
continually be able to retain

67
00:03:34.336 --> 00:03:35.356
and engage those players.

68
00:03:35.356 --> 00:03:37.156
As I said, engagement
is really key.

69
00:03:37.746 --> 00:03:41.516
We've identified these and
other traits among these games.

70
00:03:42.116 --> 00:03:44.916
And I'd like to invite Allan
Schaffer up on stage to talk

71
00:03:44.916 --> 00:03:48.566
about these key ingredients
for great games.

72
00:03:51.366 --> 00:03:53.766
>> Thank you, sir.

73
00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:54.786
Hello, everyone.

74
00:03:54.786 --> 00:03:57.756
Welcome to WWDC 2014 and games.

75
00:03:58.456 --> 00:03:59.936
So my name is Allan Schaffer.

76
00:03:59.936 --> 00:04:02.566
I'm the Game Technologies
Evangelist at Apple.

77
00:03:59.936 --> 00:04:02.566
I'm the Game Technologies
Evangelist at Apple.

78
00:04:02.566 --> 00:04:05.576
And, as Geoff said, I'm here
to talk to you about some

79
00:04:05.576 --> 00:04:09.086
of the things we see in some
of the best games on iOS.

80
00:04:10.106 --> 00:04:11.996
Now, there's a lot
of things that go

81
00:04:11.996 --> 00:04:13.706
into making a great game.

82
00:04:13.946 --> 00:04:17.136
And a lot of different ways to
describe that process, right?

83
00:04:17.136 --> 00:04:19.956
But to echo back to what he was
saying, when we look at games

84
00:04:19.956 --> 00:04:22.646
and we think about the
Apple Design Award winners

85
00:04:22.646 --> 00:04:25.906
over the years, we start to
see common threads and the kind

86
00:04:25.906 --> 00:04:28.746
of key ingredients that all
of these games get right.

87
00:04:28.746 --> 00:04:31.296
And that's what I want to
talk to you about today.

88
00:04:31.886 --> 00:04:35.206
So I'm going to go through a
list of some of these things

89
00:04:35.236 --> 00:04:36.756
that just really
stand out to me.

90
00:04:36.756 --> 00:04:39.766
There is a lot more than
what I'm going to go through,

91
00:04:39.766 --> 00:04:43.446
but here is the first
thing on my list: Okay,

92
00:04:44.056 --> 00:04:45.706
is to remove friction.

93
00:04:46.556 --> 00:04:50.256
So I'm talking here about
making a great first impression

94
00:04:50.256 --> 00:04:53.916
and a really frictionless first
time experience in the game,

95
00:04:54.366 --> 00:04:58.356
really streamlining
everything that gets in the way

96
00:04:58.356 --> 00:05:01.066
of the player getting into
the game as they start.

97
00:04:58.356 --> 00:05:01.066
of the player getting into
the game as they start.

98
00:05:01.356 --> 00:05:03.376
So what do I really
mean by friction here?

99
00:05:04.176 --> 00:05:07.746
So here's our imaginary
game, "Paddle Mania 3000".

100
00:05:07.746 --> 00:05:08.876
It is awesome, by the way.

101
00:05:09.346 --> 00:05:12.506
But it has some of the
problems with friction

102
00:05:12.506 --> 00:05:13.766
that I'm thinking of here.

103
00:05:13.766 --> 00:05:16.206
So let me show you first
the start up experience

104
00:05:16.206 --> 00:05:18.646
of this game: Player comes in?

105
00:05:19.446 --> 00:05:22.576
Loading. So, yeah,
still loading.

106
00:05:22.576 --> 00:05:24.776
And it's going to take
it about a minute to load

107
00:05:24.776 --> 00:05:25.966
because that's how
long it will take me

108
00:05:25.966 --> 00:05:27.046
to get through the slide.

109
00:05:27.046 --> 00:05:30.766
So, you know, the problem
that I have or that I see here

110
00:05:31.006 --> 00:05:33.806
with a number of games is
that they really take kind

111
00:05:33.806 --> 00:05:37.466
of a monolithic approach
to loading their assets.

112
00:05:37.906 --> 00:05:41.786
And they preload everything
up front instead of, you know,

113
00:05:41.786 --> 00:05:44.626
trying to just do what they
need just to get started.

114
00:05:45.536 --> 00:05:48.366
So your goal should
be to get interactive

115
00:05:48.366 --> 00:05:49.926
as quickly as you can.

116
00:05:50.216 --> 00:05:53.296
Load just enough of your
assets so that you can get up

117
00:05:53.296 --> 00:05:55.616
and running to your
first interactive screen.

118
00:05:55.616 --> 00:05:58.356
And then use technologies
like Grand Central Dispatch,

119
00:05:58.356 --> 00:06:02.286
and so on, to move work off
of your main thread and so,

120
00:05:58.356 --> 00:06:02.286
and so on, to move work off
of your main thread and so,

121
00:06:02.286 --> 00:06:04.326
and let that continue
asynchronously.

122
00:06:05.136 --> 00:06:09.366
Then, also, use the Time
Profiler to really take a look

123
00:06:09.366 --> 00:06:11.166
at your loading performance.

124
00:06:11.616 --> 00:06:13.706
And it will show you in a lot

125
00:06:13.706 --> 00:06:17.836
of detail exactly what work the
app is doing during that time.

126
00:06:18.496 --> 00:06:21.396
But even before you get into
the Time Profiler, I don't want

127
00:06:21.396 --> 00:06:24.376
to just punt to the Time
Profiler as my advice.

128
00:06:24.756 --> 00:06:28.616
You have to really think
about it first, right?

129
00:06:28.686 --> 00:06:31.546
Why are so many things
being loaded up front?

130
00:06:32.036 --> 00:06:34.986
And isn't there something
that could be deferred

131
00:06:34.986 --> 00:06:39.006
and loaded asynchronously
a little bit later?

132
00:06:39.556 --> 00:06:41.726
So, okay. So it's done loading.

133
00:06:41.726 --> 00:06:46.996
And now let's go on to now
we're downloading some assets.

134
00:06:47.386 --> 00:06:50.896
Okay. So, you know, a lot of
you guys do this in the game.

135
00:06:50.896 --> 00:06:51.596
And it's fine.

136
00:06:51.626 --> 00:06:53.566
In many cases, it's
a good thing.

137
00:06:54.026 --> 00:06:56.406
But it doesn't have
to be something

138
00:06:56.406 --> 00:06:58.586
where it makes the player wait.

139
00:06:59.306 --> 00:07:02.276
So later in the talk I'm going
to go through a couple of things

140
00:06:59.306 --> 00:07:02.276
So later in the talk I'm going
to go through a couple of things

141
00:07:02.276 --> 00:07:04.726
that you can do to move
this off to the side

142
00:07:04.726 --> 00:07:07.056
so the user doesn't
even have to notice it.

143
00:07:08.046 --> 00:07:11.256
Okay, next: registration.

144
00:07:11.446 --> 00:07:13.366
Would I like a "Paddle
Mania" account?

145
00:07:13.886 --> 00:07:16.386
No, I would like to
play "Paddle Mania".

146
00:07:17.866 --> 00:07:21.156
So, you know, when you think
about the registration,

147
00:07:21.496 --> 00:07:23.416
there's a couple of
possibilities here.

148
00:07:23.896 --> 00:07:27.166
You know, maybe, actually
that registration is needed.

149
00:07:27.166 --> 00:07:30.386
Maybe you have a game
that is server backed,

150
00:07:30.896 --> 00:07:33.536
and you need some way to
uniquely identify this player.

151
00:07:34.126 --> 00:07:35.486
If that's the case,

152
00:07:35.486 --> 00:07:39.236
then actually you could just use
the Vendor ID that we provide

153
00:07:39.306 --> 00:07:42.776
to the game as the unique
identifier for that player.

154
00:07:42.776 --> 00:07:45.616
And get it so that it's
out of the player's way.

155
00:07:45.916 --> 00:07:47.216
Handle it automatically.

156
00:07:48.266 --> 00:07:51.426
But maybe the case isn't that
you have a server backed game.

157
00:07:51.426 --> 00:07:53.906
Maybe you're just asking the
user to sign up for an account

158
00:07:53.906 --> 00:07:57.526
because you want to give
them news or special offers

159
00:07:57.526 --> 00:07:59.446
or just whatever
the reason may be.

160
00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:02.516
Well, the first-time experience

161
00:08:02.516 --> 00:08:05.626
in the game is not the right
time to ask for this yet.

162
00:08:05.926 --> 00:08:09.296
They don't who, you know,
why you might be asking.

163
00:08:09.296 --> 00:08:12.226
So, of course, you would
need to clearly explain it.

164
00:08:12.226 --> 00:08:13.226
Like, is it needed?

165
00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:14.756
Or is it just kind of extra?

166
00:08:14.756 --> 00:08:19.556
And if it's not really needed,
then defer it until later.

167
00:08:20.016 --> 00:08:22.396
So I want to play, I'm
going to say, no thanks.

168
00:08:24.066 --> 00:08:26.246
Next, configure my paddle.

169
00:08:26.646 --> 00:08:27.596
It's "Paddle Mania".

170
00:08:28.106 --> 00:08:30.236
But, so, let me be clear:

171
00:08:30.566 --> 00:08:33.385
If this is my first
time playing the game,

172
00:08:33.726 --> 00:08:35.606
then I don't know the
implications of any

173
00:08:35.606 --> 00:08:38.056
of these choices,
right, to go and play.

174
00:08:38.586 --> 00:08:42.256
So if they matter, then
now is not the time

175
00:08:42.256 --> 00:08:43.775
to ask me because I don't know.

176
00:08:44.496 --> 00:08:47.736
And if they don't matter,
then don't put them in the way

177
00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:49.866
of user getting onboard
into the game.

178
00:08:51.496 --> 00:08:55.476
And, you know, not knowing
either way sort of conveys

179
00:08:55.476 --> 00:08:58.886
to the players that it's not
really-the experience here

180
00:08:58.886 --> 00:09:00.446
hadn't really been
thought through.

181
00:08:58.886 --> 00:09:00.446
hadn't really been
thought through.

182
00:09:00.656 --> 00:09:03.056
And so there's some real trouble
with "Paddle Mania", actually.

183
00:09:04.156 --> 00:09:06.286
And then, yeah, there we go.

184
00:09:06.856 --> 00:09:08.906
The last one here:
please leave a rating.

185
00:09:08.906 --> 00:09:13.526
You know, this is fine, right,
we talk about this all the time.

186
00:09:14.136 --> 00:09:17.356
But, you know, at
this point, actually,

187
00:09:17.356 --> 00:09:19.106
I haven't even played
the game yet.

188
00:09:19.106 --> 00:09:21.296
So, you know, now is not
the best time to come

189
00:09:21.296 --> 00:09:22.756
and ask me about rating it.

190
00:09:23.226 --> 00:09:26.086
But, you know, I think, you
guys are getting it here, right.

191
00:09:26.156 --> 00:09:28.216
So let me give you the
takeaways of this first section:

192
00:09:28.216 --> 00:09:30.686
So you've got to get the
player into the game.

193
00:09:31.076 --> 00:09:34.236
Reduce the load time
and any blocking updates

194
00:09:34.236 --> 00:09:37.306
to get the game interactive
as quickly as possible.

195
00:09:37.776 --> 00:09:40.226
Then streamline the
registration, right.

196
00:09:40.486 --> 00:09:43.866
Provide an escape from
tutorials and long intros

197
00:09:43.866 --> 00:09:45.606
and all those things that
might get in the way.

198
00:09:45.606 --> 00:09:49.846
And then don't force
decisions about something

199
00:09:49.846 --> 00:09:52.846
that the player can't
possibly know about yet.

200
00:09:53.316 --> 00:09:55.666
And be patient, you
know, show some restraint

201
00:09:55.666 --> 00:09:57.296
when you're asking for feedback.

202
00:09:58.626 --> 00:10:00.966
So that's number
one: remove friction

203
00:09:58.626 --> 00:10:00.966
So that's number
one: remove friction

204
00:10:00.966 --> 00:10:02.766
from the first time experience.

205
00:10:04.046 --> 00:10:07.146
Okay, here's number
two: be a good teacher.

206
00:10:08.196 --> 00:10:11.766
So being a good teacher is
really all about thinking

207
00:10:11.806 --> 00:10:13.496
through that onboarding
experience

208
00:10:13.496 --> 00:10:15.316
and really kind of
making it fun.

209
00:10:15.686 --> 00:10:19.826
Because if you can help
your players get started,

210
00:10:19.826 --> 00:10:22.806
it's more likely that they'll
become more deeply engaged

211
00:10:22.806 --> 00:10:23.676
into the game.

212
00:10:24.126 --> 00:10:26.406
And, you know, it's
almost easier to think

213
00:10:26.406 --> 00:10:27.576
of it on the other side.

214
00:10:27.966 --> 00:10:30.806
If you just leave it
to the player to figure

215
00:10:30.806 --> 00:10:34.596
out your game themselves,
then you run a lot of risks.

216
00:10:34.596 --> 00:10:37.466
You risk people just
failing a couple of times

217
00:10:37.466 --> 00:10:39.956
and getting frustrated
and leaving the game.

218
00:10:40.396 --> 00:10:43.986
Or maybe they'll miss something
that was really important

219
00:10:44.166 --> 00:10:46.696
to the gameplay and would
have captured their interest,

220
00:10:46.926 --> 00:10:47.936
but they just didn't see it.

221
00:10:47.936 --> 00:10:50.306
They didn't know to
go down that path.

222
00:10:50.676 --> 00:10:52.906
So yesterday during the
design award ceremony,

223
00:10:52.906 --> 00:10:53.696
John was up here.

224
00:10:53.696 --> 00:10:56.546
He talked about "Leo's
Fortune" as his example.

225
00:10:56.776 --> 00:10:58.446
I'm going to use a
different example:

226
00:10:58.446 --> 00:11:03.626
Apple Design Award Winner from
2011, and that's "Cut the Rope".

227
00:10:58.446 --> 00:11:03.626
Apple Design Award Winner from
2011, and that's "Cut the Rope".

228
00:11:04.086 --> 00:11:06.046
So this was an awesome
puzzle game.

229
00:11:06.046 --> 00:11:09.016
And it's kind of the
perfect example here to use

230
00:11:09.016 --> 00:11:10.956
as an onboarding case study.

231
00:11:11.436 --> 00:11:15.156
So right away what you see here
is they're using coaching tips

232
00:11:15.206 --> 00:11:18.076
to explain the goal,
which is to deliver candy

233
00:11:18.076 --> 00:11:19.456
to Om Nom, the little character.

234
00:11:20.356 --> 00:11:22.556
And then they start to
tell you about things

235
00:11:22.556 --> 00:11:24.186
like the primary interaction.

236
00:11:24.246 --> 00:11:25.576
In "Cut the Rope", you swipe

237
00:11:25.736 --> 00:11:27.216
with your finger
to cut the rope.

238
00:11:27.746 --> 00:11:30.016
Now you might be looking at
this kind of going like, well,

239
00:11:30.016 --> 00:11:30.926
that's totally obvious.

240
00:11:31.376 --> 00:11:33.776
But, no, it's only because
you've seen this picture.

241
00:11:34.146 --> 00:11:38.426
And so the, you know what
people would do without this,

242
00:11:38.426 --> 00:11:41.656
they would tap the candy,
they would tap Om Nom trying

243
00:11:41.656 --> 00:11:43.596
to get him to jump
up and eat the candy.

244
00:11:43.596 --> 00:11:44.576
They don't know what to do.

245
00:11:44.916 --> 00:11:46.836
And those aren't the
right interactions, right?

246
00:11:46.876 --> 00:11:49.646
The correct one is to
swipe, cut the rope.

247
00:11:50.396 --> 00:11:53.526
So then once the
player has that down,

248
00:11:53.526 --> 00:11:56.446
then they start introducing new
interactions one at that time.

249
00:11:56.916 --> 00:11:58.866
So each time there's
another coaching tip.

250
00:11:59.276 --> 00:12:03.126
So here you cut the rope,
the candy flows down,

251
00:11:59.276 --> 00:12:03.126
So here you cut the rope,
the candy flows down,

252
00:12:03.126 --> 00:12:04.156
it goes into the bubble,

253
00:12:04.156 --> 00:12:06.216
and then the bubble will
start to lift it up.

254
00:12:06.686 --> 00:12:09.946
And then there's another tip
put right in context once

255
00:12:09.986 --> 00:12:12.726
that happens telling the
player to pop the bubble

256
00:12:12.726 --> 00:12:15.456
with their finger and
that will release it

257
00:12:15.456 --> 00:12:17.626
and it will come down to Om Nom.

258
00:12:18.236 --> 00:12:23.426
Okay. And then more really
sort of subtle thing is

259
00:12:23.426 --> 00:12:27.906
that a big part of the
gameplay in Cut the Rope comes

260
00:12:27.966 --> 00:12:30.456
from trying to get the candy

261
00:12:30.456 --> 00:12:35.566
to touch all the stars before
it gets down to Om Nom and kind

262
00:12:35.566 --> 00:12:36.926
of routing around that way.

263
00:12:36.926 --> 00:12:40.166
And to be successful at that
usually takes some trial

264
00:12:40.166 --> 00:12:41.526
and error on every level

265
00:12:41.766 --> 00:12:42.906
when you're actually
playing the game.

266
00:12:43.226 --> 00:12:46.946
So it's actually really
important to the Core Loop

267
00:12:46.946 --> 00:12:52.196
of this game to show players
how they can try again, right.

268
00:12:52.196 --> 00:12:55.976
So in their onboarding, they
call that out specifically.

269
00:12:55.976 --> 00:12:57.996
And you would think oh,
that's just, you know,

270
00:12:57.996 --> 00:12:59.856
okay fine they're showing
me around the buttons.

271
00:13:00.236 --> 00:13:03.306
But, no, if they had left
that to the player to discover

272
00:13:03.306 --> 00:13:05.756
on their own, some people
might not have played

273
00:13:05.756 --> 00:13:08.666
around with all the buttons and
the menus to go and play again.

274
00:13:08.666 --> 00:13:10.896
But really this is
core to the gameplay

275
00:13:11.066 --> 00:13:13.956
so that's why they show it.

276
00:13:14.286 --> 00:13:15.636
But, okay, so to summarize now:

277
00:13:16.236 --> 00:13:19.876
So start by bringing the
player right into the game

278
00:13:19.876 --> 00:13:21.546
and show them how
to get started.

279
00:13:21.546 --> 00:13:25.386
And then introduce more complex
interactions one at that time.

280
00:13:26.136 --> 00:13:28.806
Provide tips and
context as you go along

281
00:13:28.806 --> 00:13:32.726
and then help them discover the
things that will be important

282
00:13:32.726 --> 00:13:34.636
in the game as they
play through it.

283
00:13:35.046 --> 00:13:36.926
So that's number two:
be a good teacher.

284
00:13:37.776 --> 00:13:41.166
Now, I want to mention, also,
we're having a related session.

285
00:13:41.166 --> 00:13:43.506
It's going to be on
Thursday, very aptly named,

286
00:13:43.886 --> 00:13:46.866
"Making a Great First Impression
with Strong Onboarding Design".

287
00:13:46.866 --> 00:13:49.456
We'll spend a whole hour
going through some examples

288
00:13:49.456 --> 00:13:50.956
that really get this right.

289
00:13:50.956 --> 00:13:52.606
So be sure to catch
that on Thursday.

290
00:13:53.746 --> 00:13:57.816
All right, now I want to turn
focus to the gameplay itself.

291
00:13:57.816 --> 00:14:02.116
So number three is to really
tune and perfect your Core Loop.

292
00:13:57.816 --> 00:14:02.116
So number three is to really
tune and perfect your Core Loop.

293
00:14:02.116 --> 00:14:04.366
You know, I talk to
people all the time.

294
00:14:04.366 --> 00:14:06.996
And people will ask me to
take a look at their game,

295
00:14:06.996 --> 00:14:09.206
give them some feedback, you
know stuff under development.

296
00:14:09.726 --> 00:14:12.486
And a lot of times what I'm
looking at is something,

297
00:14:12.486 --> 00:14:15.716
you know, they're saying, I just
it doesn't really feel fun yet.

298
00:14:16.156 --> 00:14:19.446
And what that really comes
down to is the Core Loop.

299
00:14:20.316 --> 00:14:23.126
So Core Loop is the
term that wraps up how

300
00:14:23.126 --> 00:14:25.786
to describe the game mechanic
in terms of, you know,

301
00:14:25.786 --> 00:14:27.836
the actions the player
takes in the game;

302
00:14:28.106 --> 00:14:30.916
the reward that they
receive, you know,

303
00:14:30.916 --> 00:14:35.816
as they're pursuing a goal;
and the resulting expansion

304
00:14:35.816 --> 00:14:40.086
of the game or the growth of the
character that motivated them

305
00:14:40.086 --> 00:14:41.236
to pursue that reward.

306
00:14:42.056 --> 00:14:44.396
And just in games that
aren't quite right,

307
00:14:44.536 --> 00:14:46.996
what I often find is that
there's some disconnect

308
00:14:46.996 --> 00:14:51.026
in this cycle or some
mismatch between the parts

309
00:14:51.466 --> 00:14:52.796
so they don't really
line up well.

310
00:14:53.556 --> 00:14:55.386
But, so let me just
illustrate this

311
00:14:55.426 --> 00:14:58.576
by showing you some typical
examples from different genres,

312
00:14:58.576 --> 00:14:59.746
just to set the stage.

313
00:14:59.746 --> 00:15:02.326
So, you know, here is a
fantasy role playing game.

314
00:14:59.746 --> 00:15:02.326
So, you know, here is a
fantasy role playing game.

315
00:15:02.646 --> 00:15:05.046
I explore the dungeon.

316
00:15:05.046 --> 00:15:06.746
I fight enemies.

317
00:15:06.746 --> 00:15:09.676
Defeating the enemies gets
me treasure and experience.

318
00:15:10.206 --> 00:15:12.706
And then I use that
treasure and experience

319
00:15:12.706 --> 00:15:15.306
to level up and to buy things.

320
00:15:15.306 --> 00:15:17.236
And then that lets
me go and fight more

321
00:15:17.236 --> 00:15:18.786
and more powerful enemies, okay?

322
00:15:18.786 --> 00:15:19.336
Very clear.

323
00:15:20.426 --> 00:15:23.296
Or a platformer, you know, the
basic idea in a platformer is

324
00:15:23.296 --> 00:15:25.616
to run and jump, okay,
that's the player action.

325
00:15:25.966 --> 00:15:28.616
But their goal is really to
complete the level itself

326
00:15:28.616 --> 00:15:31.086
and avoid all the
obstacles and the bad guys

327
00:15:31.086 --> 00:15:33.336
and collect the stars
or power ups

328
00:15:33.336 --> 00:15:35.166
or whatever is happening
on that level.

329
00:15:35.726 --> 00:15:38.616
But then if you're
successful the expansion is

330
00:15:38.616 --> 00:15:42.106
to unlock the next stage,
literally expand the universe,

331
00:15:42.106 --> 00:15:44.216
the game universe,
for that game.

332
00:15:44.666 --> 00:15:47.796
And where then you then go
and find new things to run

333
00:15:47.796 --> 00:15:50.786
and jump over, new
obstacles, and so on.

334
00:15:50.846 --> 00:15:51.186
But, okay.

335
00:15:51.186 --> 00:15:54.006
So now to get a little
deeper, you know,

336
00:15:54.006 --> 00:15:56.686
it's really worth
noting that some

337
00:15:56.686 --> 00:15:58.816
of the most compelling
games are the ones

338
00:15:59.086 --> 00:16:01.066
with more than one Core Loop.

339
00:15:59.086 --> 00:16:01.066
with more than one Core Loop.

340
00:16:01.466 --> 00:16:03.136
And I'm showing these
side by side.

341
00:16:03.236 --> 00:16:05.516
But really they're
meant to be overlapping.

342
00:16:05.866 --> 00:16:07.546
So you're fighting monsters,

343
00:16:07.546 --> 00:16:09.146
you gain experience,
you're leveling up.

344
00:16:09.206 --> 00:16:12.126
But, at the same time,
you're collecting clues.

345
00:16:12.126 --> 00:16:14.356
You're using the clues
to solve a puzzle.

346
00:16:14.646 --> 00:16:16.676
The puzzle lets you
unlock a door.

347
00:16:16.716 --> 00:16:19.686
Behind the door there's more
monsters and more clues.

348
00:16:19.686 --> 00:16:23.276
And these are overlaid in the
experience on top of each other.

349
00:16:23.886 --> 00:16:25.186
But, okay.

350
00:16:25.396 --> 00:16:28.996
So let me give you some
more concrete advice here.

351
00:16:28.996 --> 00:16:31.356
So, you know, what
really is the bottom line?

352
00:16:31.696 --> 00:16:36.176
So the best games, first,
are the ones that really,

353
00:16:37.036 --> 00:16:40.576
clearly understand their
target audience and are able

354
00:16:40.576 --> 00:16:43.416
to put center excuse
me, put the centerpoint

355
00:16:43.416 --> 00:16:46.686
of the Core Loop right
on top of that audience.

356
00:16:47.786 --> 00:16:51.186
And it's important that the Core
Loop be easy to express and kind

357
00:16:51.186 --> 00:16:52.326
of easy to understand.

358
00:16:52.326 --> 00:16:54.196
That's kind of, when
I find games

359
00:16:54.576 --> 00:16:57.956
that are have these little
mismatches, usually it's a case

360
00:16:57.956 --> 00:16:59.756
where it's difficult
for the developer

361
00:16:59.756 --> 00:17:02.906
to actually express the
Core Loop, these components,

362
00:16:59.756 --> 00:17:02.906
to actually express the
Core Loop, these components,

363
00:17:02.936 --> 00:17:06.175
clearly in terms of the action,
the reward, the expansion.

364
00:17:07.455 --> 00:17:09.806
Now, as I have been
saying, make sure each phase

365
00:17:09.806 --> 00:17:12.746
of this feeds right
into the next.

366
00:17:12.746 --> 00:17:15.016
And, sort of, all of the
energy that the player gives

367
00:17:15.016 --> 00:17:17.726
into one part of it flows
around and, kind of,

368
00:17:17.726 --> 00:17:19.266
reinforces the other parts.

369
00:17:20.566 --> 00:17:23.286
Make each iteration meaningful.

370
00:17:23.286 --> 00:17:25.336
And I'll talk about this
a little more as I talk

371
00:17:25.336 --> 00:17:27.286
about progression in the game.

372
00:17:27.906 --> 00:17:30.866
But then also question
your assumptions.

373
00:17:30.866 --> 00:17:33.696
And this is probably the best
advice for any developer is

374
00:17:33.696 --> 00:17:37.346
to go back and really
rethink it and keep iterating

375
00:17:37.346 --> 00:17:39.696
until you know you've
done it well.

376
00:17:40.326 --> 00:17:42.406
And, you know, how do you know?

377
00:17:42.406 --> 00:17:43.546
How do you really know?

378
00:17:43.546 --> 00:17:47.396
I could say playtest, but
that's just a punt, right.

379
00:17:47.396 --> 00:17:51.256
It's like, how do you really
know that you did it well?

380
00:17:52.036 --> 00:17:56.026
Well, you know it by really
thinking it through yourself.

381
00:17:56.556 --> 00:17:59.336
You know, if you find the
clues, will you be able

382
00:17:59.336 --> 00:18:02.666
to solve the puzzle without
some giant leap of faith

383
00:17:59.336 --> 00:18:02.666
to solve the puzzle without
some giant leap of faith

384
00:18:02.666 --> 00:18:06.276
or going online to Google how
to figure out this puzzle.

385
00:18:07.156 --> 00:18:10.676
Well, you know, if you unlock
something, if you solve

386
00:18:10.676 --> 00:18:13.386
that puzzle, is it going
to unlock the next stage?

387
00:18:13.716 --> 00:18:16.576
If you unlock that next stage,
will I have something new

388
00:18:16.576 --> 00:18:18.926
or novel to really look
at once I get there?

389
00:18:19.666 --> 00:18:20.956
Okay. So test it.

390
00:18:21.766 --> 00:18:25.046
But, at the same time,
don't feel boxed in.

391
00:18:25.416 --> 00:18:27.326
I am not saying that
every game needs

392
00:18:27.326 --> 00:18:31.576
to follow the same design
methodology or, you know,

393
00:18:31.576 --> 00:18:34.226
kind of deal with its
audience in the same way.

394
00:18:34.576 --> 00:18:36.906
A lot of the really
best expressions

395
00:18:37.076 --> 00:18:40.706
of great games are the ones that
aren't afraid to mix this up.

396
00:18:41.226 --> 00:18:45.166
But, so, now, let me show
you just a quick example,

397
00:18:45.986 --> 00:18:47.786
a game that's really
fantastic in the way

398
00:18:47.786 --> 00:18:50.376
that it does its Core Loop is
the Apple Design Award winner

399
00:18:50.376 --> 00:18:53.046
last year, this is "Ridiculous
Fishing" by Vlambeer.

400
00:18:53.626 --> 00:18:56.806
So it really has, I
think you could break it

401
00:18:56.806 --> 00:18:58.976
down into three distinct
mechanics.

402
00:18:59.256 --> 00:19:03.216
The first one is when you
are dropping your line

403
00:18:59.256 --> 00:19:03.216
The first one is when you
are dropping your line

404
00:19:03.216 --> 00:19:03.926
into the water.

405
00:19:03.926 --> 00:19:06.566
You're just trying to, you're
using the accelerometer

406
00:19:06.566 --> 00:19:08.456
or the gyroscope and
trying to get the line

407
00:19:08.456 --> 00:19:10.896
down through the water
avoiding the fish,

408
00:19:11.016 --> 00:19:12.326
get it as deep as you can.

409
00:19:12.466 --> 00:19:16.576
Okay. Then once you run out
of line or once you hit a fish

410
00:19:16.576 --> 00:19:19.186
on the way down,
everything reverses.

411
00:19:19.186 --> 00:19:21.976
And now you're going
back up and reeling

412
00:19:21.976 --> 00:19:23.766
in as many fish as you can.

413
00:19:24.096 --> 00:19:27.846
We're back on the gyro again
and just trying now to collect

414
00:19:27.936 --> 00:19:29.576
as many of the fish
and try to run

415
00:19:29.616 --> 00:19:31.776
into them while avoiding
the jellyfish

416
00:19:31.776 --> 00:19:33.156
and other baddies
that are there.

417
00:19:33.206 --> 00:19:37.716
And then the third loop, when
we get up to the surface,

418
00:19:37.716 --> 00:19:42.146
of course, we fling the fish up
into the air and then you tap

419
00:19:42.286 --> 00:19:44.836
on them to shoot them
out of the sky, right,

420
00:19:45.146 --> 00:19:46.756
so and collect points.

421
00:19:47.616 --> 00:19:50.936
And so, and then those
points are what we use

422
00:19:51.506 --> 00:19:53.066
as the expansion in the game.

423
00:19:53.066 --> 00:19:56.856
It lets us get a better lure,
a longer line, and so on.

424
00:19:56.856 --> 00:19:59.356
And so the game is really,
you know, hilarious.

425
00:20:00.046 --> 00:20:00.966
And if you didn't
see it last year

426
00:20:00.966 --> 00:20:03.646
from the design awards,
check it out.

427
00:20:03.916 --> 00:20:05.876
But so that's tuning
your Core Loop.

428
00:20:07.666 --> 00:20:09.876
Now, let me expand
out from there.

429
00:20:10.186 --> 00:20:13.726
And so for the next few parts
of the talk, I want to go

430
00:20:13.726 --> 00:20:17.766
through some aspects of this
next ring around the Core Loop

431
00:20:18.036 --> 00:20:20.736
and I want to start with
the interaction mechanic.

432
00:20:20.736 --> 00:20:22.756
Because obviously, you know,
how the player interacts

433
00:20:22.756 --> 00:20:25.296
with your game is completely
fundamental to the success

434
00:20:25.806 --> 00:20:27.346
of the Core Loop,
to it feeling fun.

435
00:20:27.956 --> 00:20:30.906
And if your players seem
to be having trouble

436
00:20:30.906 --> 00:20:33.286
with the controls,
this is where to start.

437
00:20:34.006 --> 00:20:36.506
And it's to design for touch.

438
00:20:37.296 --> 00:20:38.836
So sometimes when I'm working

439
00:20:38.836 --> 00:20:41.246
with someone who's
bringing a game over to iOS

440
00:20:41.446 --> 00:20:45.026
from another platform like a
PC or a console or whatever,

441
00:20:45.346 --> 00:20:49.006
their first instinct is actually
to just bring their Core Loop

442
00:20:49.006 --> 00:20:52.606
over completely unchanged,
you know, including all

443
00:20:52.606 --> 00:20:54.996
of their old interaction
mechanic, right.

444
00:20:54.996 --> 00:20:58.166
And so, you know, if their game
was based on pressing buttons

445
00:20:58.216 --> 00:21:00.016
than they just overlay
the screen,

446
00:20:58.216 --> 00:21:00.016
than they just overlay
the screen,

447
00:21:00.016 --> 00:21:01.176
superimpose some buttons.

448
00:21:02.026 --> 00:21:05.006
Or if they used to use a
D pad, then, okay, great,

449
00:21:05.006 --> 00:21:07.226
then they'll put a virtual
D pad on the screen.

450
00:21:07.976 --> 00:21:11.046
But the truth is that this is
usually not really optimal.

451
00:21:11.316 --> 00:21:13.076
These overlays get in the way

452
00:21:13.076 --> 00:21:15.476
of the player seeing
the game field.

453
00:21:16.226 --> 00:21:18.906
And, but more profoundly,
they're indirect.

454
00:21:19.286 --> 00:21:20.986
They're controls
that are controlling

455
00:21:20.986 --> 00:21:23.566
that little paddle that's
going to go underneath.

456
00:21:23.566 --> 00:21:26.316
And, you know, it's a
bouncy ball game, right?

457
00:21:26.736 --> 00:21:31.566
And so since they're indirect,
it relies on the player

458
00:21:31.566 --> 00:21:33.576
to really be able
to be in control

459
00:21:33.576 --> 00:21:35.096
of the controls themselves.

460
00:21:35.476 --> 00:21:38.506
But they can't feel when their
finger is in the right spot.

461
00:21:38.506 --> 00:21:42.016
And so they kind of have to look
at their finger a lot in order

462
00:21:42.016 --> 00:21:43.976
to be confident in
their actions.

463
00:21:45.096 --> 00:21:48.146
Okay. Now, if you step back
a moment and really think

464
00:21:48.146 --> 00:21:51.036
about where all this is
coming from, you know,

465
00:21:51.036 --> 00:21:54.296
if the game was designed with a
different interaction mechanic

466
00:21:54.296 --> 00:21:57.336
in mind, then a lot
of the assumptions

467
00:21:57.336 --> 00:22:00.336
of that other mechanic just
get built into the game.

468
00:21:57.336 --> 00:22:00.336
of that other mechanic just
get built into the game.

469
00:22:00.336 --> 00:22:03.806
They become kind of implicit and
ultimately kind of forgotten.

470
00:22:04.706 --> 00:22:09.716
And when that happens, the
answer isn't just to, kind of,

471
00:22:09.716 --> 00:22:11.586
remap some controls

472
00:22:11.586 --> 00:22:14.036
onto a virtual joystick
or virtual buttons.

473
00:22:14.496 --> 00:22:18.686
You really need to go back
and rethink those assumptions.

474
00:22:18.926 --> 00:22:22.276
And, you know, go back
and redesign for touch.

475
00:22:23.256 --> 00:22:25.746
And if you're not sure what I
really, really mean by this,

476
00:22:25.746 --> 00:22:27.796
then let's just go
back and look at some

477
00:22:27.796 --> 00:22:30.546
of the Design Award winners
over the past couple of years.

478
00:22:31.176 --> 00:22:34.866
"Monument Valley": tap the
path, and that directs Ida

479
00:22:34.866 --> 00:22:36.006
around to walk around.

480
00:22:36.646 --> 00:22:37.536
She's the main character.

481
00:22:37.536 --> 00:22:40.766
And then you or you do
these little twist gestures

482
00:22:40.866 --> 00:22:44.046
and that'll turn the cranks
and move the walkways.

483
00:22:44.796 --> 00:22:47.126
So it's based on
taps and gestures.

484
00:22:48.166 --> 00:22:50.696
"Blek": You make a
shake with your finger.

485
00:22:50.906 --> 00:22:54.046
And that's the pattern that the
stroke that's generated is going

486
00:22:54.046 --> 00:22:56.726
to follow and you try
and get that to repeat.

487
00:22:56.966 --> 00:22:58.746
And try to hit the dots.

488
00:22:58.946 --> 00:23:00.416
By the way, I'm going
to hang this picture

489
00:22:58.946 --> 00:23:00.416
By the way, I'm going
to hang this picture

490
00:23:00.416 --> 00:23:01.966
in John's office
when we get back.

491
00:23:02.996 --> 00:23:06.706
So but it's about
stroking a path.

492
00:23:06.916 --> 00:23:10.986
"Threes". So in "Threes", you
push the tiles against the walls

493
00:23:10.986 --> 00:23:14.146
to make, you know, matching
numbers join together.

494
00:23:14.146 --> 00:23:15.456
It's very, kind of, physical.

495
00:23:15.456 --> 00:23:16.806
You're pushing the tiles.

496
00:23:17.126 --> 00:23:18.996
They're coming, they're
squeezing together

497
00:23:18.996 --> 00:23:20.046
against the walls, and so on.

498
00:23:21.056 --> 00:23:23.836
But it's all based on
short strokes and swipes.

499
00:23:25.396 --> 00:23:26.296
Infinity Blade.

500
00:23:26.296 --> 00:23:29.396
You swipe the screen to control
how your character's going

501
00:23:29.396 --> 00:23:30.706
to swing its sword.

502
00:23:30.986 --> 00:23:35.606
Then there's some buttons you
press to dodge, and raise,

503
00:23:35.606 --> 00:23:37.476
you know, you put
on your shield.

504
00:23:37.886 --> 00:23:41.786
And there's some gestures
you use to cast a spell.

505
00:23:42.316 --> 00:23:45.926
But so it's taps,
swipes, and gestures.

506
00:23:47.216 --> 00:23:48.606
"Cut the Rope": We
just showed you.

507
00:23:48.606 --> 00:23:51.206
You swipe to cut the rope,
and then you tap things

508
00:23:51.206 --> 00:23:55.476
like balloons and you tap on the
bubbles and so on to blow air

509
00:23:55.476 --> 00:23:56.596
around or pop the bubbles.

510
00:23:56.596 --> 00:23:58.326
So it's taps and swipes.

511
00:23:59.406 --> 00:24:01.846
"Where's My Water": You
guys are getting this.

512
00:23:59.406 --> 00:24:01.846
"Where's My Water": You
guys are getting this.

513
00:24:01.846 --> 00:24:06.666
You know, you take your finger,
you drag a path through the dirt

514
00:24:06.826 --> 00:24:08.686
and that's where the
water is going to flow.

515
00:24:09.296 --> 00:24:12.186
So you feel your finger
touching the glass.

516
00:24:12.186 --> 00:24:17.366
You instantly get audio feedback
when you touch the screen.

517
00:24:17.786 --> 00:24:20.656
You feel the friction
as you draw that path,

518
00:24:21.076 --> 00:24:22.236
move your finger around.

519
00:24:22.476 --> 00:24:25.346
And you instantly see
the path you drew.

520
00:24:25.796 --> 00:24:28.106
So it's a game that
gets everything right.

521
00:24:28.106 --> 00:24:29.286
Everything is in sync.

522
00:24:30.156 --> 00:24:33.356
So let's take all this and
sort of distill it down

523
00:24:33.356 --> 00:24:34.916
and summarize what
I mean by this.

524
00:24:35.586 --> 00:24:38.316
So the key to what
all those games,

525
00:24:38.316 --> 00:24:43.036
and others that are all doing,
is to design their controls

526
00:24:43.276 --> 00:24:45.986
around direct interactions
reinforced

527
00:24:46.206 --> 00:24:48.206
by instantaneous feedback.

528
00:24:49.306 --> 00:24:51.446
So direct manipulation
is the key

529
00:24:51.446 --> 00:24:53.606
to that interaction
model on iOS.

530
00:24:53.606 --> 00:24:55.436
You've got to embrace the idea

531
00:24:55.436 --> 00:24:59.606
that the best iOS games are
the ones where you reach

532
00:24:59.776 --> 00:25:04.576
through the glass and touch the
game elements themselves, right.

533
00:24:59.776 --> 00:25:04.576
through the glass and touch the
game elements themselves, right.

534
00:25:04.886 --> 00:25:08.236
So it's based on touches and
taps and gestures and swipes

535
00:25:08.676 --> 00:25:10.236
and panning and drawing paths

536
00:25:11.416 --> 00:25:15.326
where those interactions are the
ones that define the gameplay.

537
00:25:16.786 --> 00:25:21.676
And then it's critical that you
provide instantaneous feedback.

538
00:25:22.156 --> 00:25:26.116
So these are the visual cues and
audio cues so that what you see

539
00:25:26.396 --> 00:25:31.456
and what you hear and what you
feel all reinforce what you did.

540
00:25:31.656 --> 00:25:33.466
And they reinforce each other.

541
00:25:35.066 --> 00:25:35.436
But, okay.

542
00:25:36.186 --> 00:25:39.636
So, with all that passion,
that was designed for touch.

543
00:25:40.206 --> 00:25:43.956
But if people seem to be
having a lot of trouble

544
00:25:43.956 --> 00:25:47.116
with your controls, go
back to those principles

545
00:25:47.116 --> 00:25:50.516
and really redesign your
Core Loop around the idea

546
00:25:50.516 --> 00:25:53.246
of direct interactions
that are reinforced

547
00:25:53.466 --> 00:25:55.016
by instantaneous feedback.

548
00:25:56.376 --> 00:25:58.996
Okay, next is to
foster engagement.

549
00:26:00.226 --> 00:26:02.956
So, you know, this about
keeping the player coming back

550
00:26:03.336 --> 00:26:03.876
to your game.

551
00:26:03.876 --> 00:26:06.646
And we use a lot of different
terms to describe this,

552
00:26:07.126 --> 00:26:08.946
you know, it's a
huge, a huge area.

553
00:26:08.946 --> 00:26:12.236
But all this is done because,
just hopefully, you know,

554
00:26:12.236 --> 00:26:15.836
having a really deeply engaged
player is going to generate word

555
00:26:15.836 --> 00:26:19.326
of mouth and viral discovery,
more business for you,

556
00:26:19.326 --> 00:26:21.126
more of a fan base, and so on.

557
00:26:21.846 --> 00:26:24.736
And there are a ton of
things to talk about here.

558
00:26:24.736 --> 00:26:28.316
But, you know, and I'll get
to some specifics in a minute.

559
00:26:28.886 --> 00:26:31.716
But I want to first say
something else that's a little

560
00:26:31.716 --> 00:26:33.576
deeper about this.

561
00:26:34.676 --> 00:26:37.896
So it's really easy for
any of us to, kind of,

562
00:26:37.896 --> 00:26:41.286
get wrapped up in the
details of the Core Loop

563
00:26:41.286 --> 00:26:42.816
and the onboarding and so on.

564
00:26:43.526 --> 00:26:49.466
But it's important for you to be
able to rise above those details

565
00:26:49.926 --> 00:26:53.816
of the game and really see the
game from the player perspective

566
00:26:54.366 --> 00:26:58.186
and understand that the
design process here is

567
00:26:58.186 --> 00:27:00.266
profoundly fractal.

568
00:26:58.186 --> 00:27:00.266
profoundly fractal.

569
00:27:01.206 --> 00:27:05.426
The same patterns emerge
at every level of detail.

570
00:27:05.706 --> 00:27:08.006
And there are resonances
among them.

571
00:27:08.946 --> 00:27:12.096
So even if you get the
game loop completely right,

572
00:27:12.096 --> 00:27:16.066
if you can't rise above
that, it won't resonate

573
00:27:16.066 --> 00:27:17.846
with your meta game
or your progression.

574
00:27:18.276 --> 00:27:22.236
If you get the progression right
but you can't rise above that,

575
00:27:22.816 --> 00:27:25.986
it won't resonate with the
storyline, and so on and so on.

576
00:27:27.496 --> 00:27:27.886
But, okay.

577
00:27:28.026 --> 00:27:31.516
So now taking this down a notch,
back to Earth just a moment.

578
00:27:31.966 --> 00:27:35.666
Do you remember how a couple
of moments ago I said that,

579
00:27:35.666 --> 00:27:38.146
you know, a lot of really
interesting games overlay

580
00:27:38.146 --> 00:27:39.436
multiple Core Loops?

581
00:27:40.066 --> 00:27:42.816
Well, that holds true for
the progression as well.

582
00:27:42.816 --> 00:27:45.036
And so one way that
you can really get,

583
00:27:45.036 --> 00:27:48.826
hold the player's interest is
to provide layers of progression

584
00:27:48.826 --> 00:27:52.386
or overlays of it, of
progression and expansion

585
00:27:52.386 --> 00:27:55.496
with multiple goals, multiple
paths of goals, I mean,

586
00:27:55.666 --> 00:27:57.576
multiple paths of challenges,

587
00:27:58.076 --> 00:28:01.936
and different paths
giving different balance

588
00:27:58.076 --> 00:28:01.936
and different paths
giving different balance

589
00:28:01.936 --> 00:28:03.836
between risk and reward.

590
00:28:04.286 --> 00:28:07.106
That's something that players
will find very, very compelling.

591
00:28:07.906 --> 00:28:11.556
And you can even gamify
the expansions themselves.

592
00:28:11.956 --> 00:28:13.996
So this is, you know, kind
of the essence of a lot

593
00:28:13.996 --> 00:28:17.996
of crafting games is that you
make the expansions themselves

594
00:28:17.996 --> 00:28:21.466
into choices that the players
have to make that are strategic

595
00:28:21.466 --> 00:28:23.236
to the future of their gameplay.

596
00:28:23.636 --> 00:28:26.356
And then you ensure
that you take them

597
00:28:26.356 --> 00:28:30.086
down different paths
depending on what they've done.

598
00:28:30.976 --> 00:28:31.666
But, okay.

599
00:28:31.836 --> 00:28:35.136
This next one now, so this
is particularly important

600
00:28:35.136 --> 00:28:37.186
for anyone who's making
free to play games.

601
00:28:37.526 --> 00:28:40.326
And that's to provide
value for everyone,

602
00:28:40.596 --> 00:28:43.966
both your paying players
and your non-paying players.

603
00:28:44.696 --> 00:28:48.176
So work through the
entire experience for both

604
00:28:48.176 --> 00:28:51.066
of those audiences
to ensure that those

605
00:28:51.066 --> 00:28:56.006
who are playing your game for
free can progress, can expand,

606
00:28:56.456 --> 00:28:58.656
and, sure, they can
see the benefit.

607
00:28:58.806 --> 00:29:01.496
Show them the benefit of
becoming a paying player.

608
00:28:58.806 --> 00:29:01.496
Show them the benefit of
becoming a paying player.

609
00:29:01.966 --> 00:29:05.436
But if you try to force them,
then you'll lose engagement

610
00:29:05.526 --> 00:29:07.126
with a fair number of them.

611
00:29:07.986 --> 00:29:11.516
And on the other side, ensure
that those who are paying

612
00:29:11.516 --> 00:29:13.506
in your game will feel

613
00:29:13.506 --> 00:29:16.006
that they're getting
properly rewarded in the game

614
00:29:16.006 --> 00:29:18.296
and getting something for the
money that they're spending.

615
00:29:19.676 --> 00:29:23.286
Then next, again, this is
holding the player's interest.

616
00:29:23.716 --> 00:29:27.876
So really do what you can
to incentivize repeat play.

617
00:29:28.446 --> 00:29:32.886
So enable and motivate the
player to try one more time.

618
00:29:33.386 --> 00:29:36.276
Enable and motivate the
player to see what's next.

619
00:29:36.736 --> 00:29:40.416
Enable and motivate to
see how it ends, right.

620
00:29:40.416 --> 00:29:42.566
And if you think about
where these fit in,

621
00:29:43.516 --> 00:29:45.606
"one more try" is
about the Core Loop.

622
00:29:46.646 --> 00:29:48.926
"See what's next" is
about the progression.

623
00:29:49.636 --> 00:29:53.106
"See how it ends" is about
the storyline, right.

624
00:29:54.746 --> 00:29:59.976
Okay. Now, let me talk a
bit about re engagement.

625
00:30:00.146 --> 00:30:02.356
So providing really,
you know, coming out

626
00:30:02.356 --> 00:30:05.146
and providing really
fresh new content

627
00:30:05.336 --> 00:30:07.926
after you've launched
is a great way

628
00:30:07.926 --> 00:30:10.376
to keep your momentum
going and, in many cases,

629
00:30:10.376 --> 00:30:12.406
even to help drive new growth.

630
00:30:13.046 --> 00:30:16.846
So really think about how
you will continue your story

631
00:30:17.126 --> 00:30:20.506
to provide new content or
new levels or new goals

632
00:30:20.506 --> 00:30:21.826
or challenges, and so on.

633
00:30:22.366 --> 00:30:25.146
Or seasonal content
around holidays.

634
00:30:25.336 --> 00:30:27.846
Or regional content
in different locales.

635
00:30:28.476 --> 00:30:31.686
It's all to give your players
another positive reason

636
00:30:31.686 --> 00:30:33.336
to come back into the game.

637
00:30:33.926 --> 00:30:38.156
And it's important that you
plan this out before you launch.

638
00:30:39.086 --> 00:30:43.496
Because the people who have had
catastrophic success are the

639
00:30:43.496 --> 00:30:45.566
ones who a game takes off

640
00:30:45.566 --> 00:30:47.606
and then they realize
people are done.

641
00:30:48.376 --> 00:30:51.116
And they need to scramble
to get more content out.

642
00:30:51.466 --> 00:30:53.476
You're most engaged
players are going

643
00:30:53.476 --> 00:30:58.216
to consume your content very
quickly; so have it ready.

644
00:30:58.986 --> 00:31:01.076
Have it ready to go
so that your really,

645
00:30:58.986 --> 00:31:01.076
Have it ready to go
so that your really,

646
00:31:01.076 --> 00:31:03.516
deeply engaged players can
have something that's going

647
00:31:03.516 --> 00:31:05.006
to bring them back
into the game.

648
00:31:05.266 --> 00:31:09.316
And you'll attract new
players to come in as well.

649
00:31:09.526 --> 00:31:12.256
Now, it's also important
to really measure

650
00:31:12.256 --> 00:31:15.016
and understand how well
you're retaining your players.

651
00:31:15.456 --> 00:31:17.216
And starting later this fall,

652
00:31:17.476 --> 00:31:21.116
we'll be providing
retention information to you

653
00:31:21.366 --> 00:31:22.536
through iTunes Connect.

654
00:31:23.276 --> 00:31:25.736
So this is going to show you
how many players have downloaded

655
00:31:25.736 --> 00:31:30.356
your game by day, by region,
by platform, by source

656
00:31:30.996 --> 00:31:34.576
and what percentage of them
kept playing in the days

657
00:31:34.576 --> 00:31:36.816
that followed their download.

658
00:31:37.486 --> 00:31:39.936
And so this is just
a taste, okay.

659
00:31:39.936 --> 00:31:42.116
So we'll show you a
lot more about this

660
00:31:42.656 --> 00:31:45.356
in the iTunes Connect
session tomorrow morning.

661
00:31:45.946 --> 00:31:49.736
But so that's number five:
to foster engagement.

662
00:31:50.726 --> 00:31:53.816
So now, let me turn the
focus the other way and get

663
00:31:53.816 --> 00:31:56.046
into a couple of things
on the technical side.

664
00:31:56.576 --> 00:31:59.866
And so this is number six:
to use background transfers.

665
00:32:00.356 --> 00:32:01.216
Huh? Okay.

666
00:32:01.216 --> 00:32:04.176
So you remember back
in the first section

667
00:32:04.176 --> 00:32:05.596
where I was talking
about friction,

668
00:32:05.596 --> 00:32:07.476
I talked about downloading
updates,

669
00:32:07.786 --> 00:32:10.076
and I said that that was
something that we could move

670
00:32:10.076 --> 00:32:11.236
out of the player's way?

671
00:32:11.236 --> 00:32:14.856
That's what this is about and
that's what I'll get into here.

672
00:32:15.096 --> 00:32:18.436
So in "Paddle Mania
3000", we have, you know,

673
00:32:18.536 --> 00:32:20.526
thousands of image
assets because we have

674
00:32:20.526 --> 00:32:21.876
so many levels, right.

675
00:32:21.876 --> 00:32:25.026
We have-and for all of
those different assets,

676
00:32:25.236 --> 00:32:28.936
we have one for Retina,
non Retina, iPhone 5s,

677
00:32:29.016 --> 00:32:30.596
the iPad, iPad Air, right.

678
00:32:30.596 --> 00:32:32.606
And then we have
all of our sounds,

679
00:32:32.606 --> 00:32:34.976
AAC and MP3 for our soundtrack.

680
00:32:34.976 --> 00:32:39.236
We've got Linear PCM for
audio effects with OpenAL.

681
00:32:39.676 --> 00:32:42.806
We've got 13 different
localizations, right.

682
00:32:42.806 --> 00:32:46.296
So English, French, you
know, EFIGS, Japanese,

683
00:32:46.296 --> 00:32:48.866
Traditional Chinese,
Simplified Chinese, Brazilian,

684
00:32:48.866 --> 00:32:50.226
Portuguese, and a few more.

685
00:32:50.766 --> 00:32:53.536
And then we have a binary
compiled three different,

686
00:32:53.536 --> 00:32:57.326
you know, three ways:
armv7, armv7s, arm64.

687
00:32:57.326 --> 00:33:01.386
Okay. So there's a lot of
stuff in "Paddle Mania 3000".

688
00:32:57.326 --> 00:33:01.386
Okay. So there's a lot of
stuff in "Paddle Mania 3000".

689
00:33:01.976 --> 00:33:05.266
And you know putting all
that together is putting us

690
00:33:05.266 --> 00:33:08.806
over the limit for
downloading over cellular.

691
00:33:09.246 --> 00:33:10.806
So what do you do?

692
00:33:10.846 --> 00:33:15.556
Well, you know, a lot of times,
a discussion will begin, and,

693
00:33:15.556 --> 00:33:17.786
you know, quite often there
will be somebody who will chime

694
00:33:17.786 --> 00:33:22.006
in with advice like this:
"One size fits all!"

695
00:33:22.546 --> 00:33:23.926
Just ship one size.

696
00:33:23.926 --> 00:33:24.746
Stretch it.

697
00:33:25.136 --> 00:33:27.236
Stretch it to fit
on all platforms,

698
00:33:27.576 --> 00:33:29.616
or just ship one localization.

699
00:33:29.616 --> 00:33:31.316
They all speak English, right?

700
00:33:32.076 --> 00:33:33.626
No, they really don't.

701
00:33:34.696 --> 00:33:37.306
So don't sacrifice quality.

702
00:33:37.526 --> 00:33:40.656
And don't shortchange
your global audience.

703
00:33:41.196 --> 00:33:44.976
Realize that what you could
probably get your game

704
00:33:44.976 --> 00:33:48.596
under 100 megabytes if you use
background transfers, you know,

705
00:33:48.596 --> 00:33:51.686
and let the user download
the main bundle of it now

706
00:33:51.686 --> 00:33:54.026
but have more content
that gets transferred

707
00:33:54.026 --> 00:33:56.056
down after they've
run it the first time.

708
00:33:57.126 --> 00:33:59.406
So there's a couple of
things to do this now.

709
00:33:59.756 --> 00:34:02.336
So the first step really is
to take a good solid look

710
00:33:59.756 --> 00:34:02.336
So the first step really is
to take a good solid look

711
00:34:02.336 --> 00:34:05.696
at your game and the
game design and determine

712
00:34:05.696 --> 00:34:07.016
if there is some content

713
00:34:07.016 --> 00:34:09.485
that isn't really
needed right up front.

714
00:34:10.206 --> 00:34:12.545
And games, especially
games with any kind

715
00:34:12.545 --> 00:34:16.485
of a linear progression are
perfect for this, right.

716
00:34:16.795 --> 00:34:19.275
You put the first couple of
hours or whatever, you know,

717
00:34:19.275 --> 00:34:23.226
the first 20, 30 levels in
the bundle at full quality.

718
00:34:23.815 --> 00:34:26.696
And then that's going to
provide enough time for the user

719
00:34:26.696 --> 00:34:29.666
to be playing, and then you
use background transfers

720
00:34:29.906 --> 00:34:32.576
to download the rest while
their playing those first 20.

721
00:34:32.576 --> 00:34:34.946
So how's this done?

722
00:34:35.735 --> 00:34:38.966
Okay. So NSURLSession is an
API that we introduced back

723
00:34:38.966 --> 00:34:42.596
in iOS 7, and the
use is to upload

724
00:34:42.596 --> 00:34:44.956
and download data
from your own server.

725
00:34:45.286 --> 00:34:47.676
And this is intended
for large data sets.

726
00:34:47.726 --> 00:34:52.176
So game levels, big images,
sound files, texture atlases,

727
00:34:52.176 --> 00:34:53.565
all that kind of thing, right.

728
00:34:54.196 --> 00:34:58.046
Now, the transfer, itself,
happens outside of your process.

729
00:34:58.046 --> 00:34:58.996
You just set it off.

730
00:34:58.996 --> 00:35:01.096
You'll get notified
when it's completed.

731
00:34:58.996 --> 00:35:01.096
You'll get notified
when it's completed.

732
00:35:01.396 --> 00:35:04.116
The player can continue
or the app can even be,

733
00:35:04.116 --> 00:35:05.946
you know, quit or terminated.

734
00:35:05.946 --> 00:35:07.986
And the download is
going to keep on going.

735
00:35:08.696 --> 00:35:11.276
And the app, if it's
running, will be notified,

736
00:35:11.276 --> 00:35:14.726
or it'll be woken up when
the transfer is done.

737
00:35:15.136 --> 00:35:18.236
And it's just enough so that you
can take the content that's been

738
00:35:18.236 --> 00:35:21.156
downloaded and, kind
of, unpack it and put it

739
00:35:21.156 --> 00:35:22.666
into its permanent location.

740
00:35:23.376 --> 00:35:24.646
So it's really useful.

741
00:35:25.566 --> 00:35:28.456
It does obviously, it adds
some complexity, right.

742
00:35:28.456 --> 00:35:30.926
Because you're going to have
to handle some corner cases now

743
00:35:31.046 --> 00:35:33.736
that you didn't have before,
like the player running

744
00:35:33.736 --> 00:35:37.646
out of disk space or, you
know, reaching a level

745
00:35:37.646 --> 00:35:39.866
that you haven't
successfully downloaded yet.

746
00:35:40.676 --> 00:35:42.346
And it's important, also,

747
00:35:42.346 --> 00:35:44.806
that you follow the iOS
Data Storage Guidelines.

748
00:35:44.896 --> 00:35:46.996
So these will tell you exactly

749
00:35:46.996 --> 00:35:49.986
where to put any
downloaded assets.

750
00:35:50.596 --> 00:35:55.416
And also remember, this is about
assets, you know, new textures,

751
00:35:55.416 --> 00:35:59.166
new levels, new sounds, and that
kind of thing, but not code.

752
00:35:59.616 --> 00:36:02.256
If you're making code
changes, that has to go back

753
00:35:59.616 --> 00:36:02.256
If you're making code
changes, that has to go back

754
00:36:02.256 --> 00:36:05.206
up through app review
as an update to the app.

755
00:36:05.776 --> 00:36:09.236
But, okay, so that's number six:
to use background transfers.

756
00:36:09.646 --> 00:36:13.316
And, you know, if you're going
to be targeting iOS 7 and above,

757
00:36:13.316 --> 00:36:16.596
like now is the time, right,
because you can move cleanly

758
00:36:16.596 --> 00:36:22.026
up to all of your supported
devices with NSURLSession.

759
00:36:23.886 --> 00:36:27.176
Okay, number seven: optimize
graphics performance.

760
00:36:28.256 --> 00:36:29.656
So, you know, I've
mentioned I meet

761
00:36:29.656 --> 00:36:30.896
with developers all the time.

762
00:36:30.896 --> 00:36:32.896
I probably met with some
of the people in this room.

763
00:36:33.276 --> 00:36:35.876
And, you know, to give people
feedback on their games,

764
00:36:36.116 --> 00:36:40.806
but one of the things that just
very, very honestly that I love

765
00:36:40.916 --> 00:36:43.446
to do is to run their game

766
00:36:43.446 --> 00:36:47.146
through our performance tools
and, kind of, use that to figure

767
00:36:47.836 --> 00:36:52.596
out what optimizations they need
to make in OpenGL and so on.

768
00:36:52.596 --> 00:36:55.176
It's kind of what I eat
for breakfast, right.

769
00:36:55.496 --> 00:36:59.546
Now, so as I get into this
section, though, the first thing

770
00:36:59.546 --> 00:37:02.266
to realize and to
say about it is

771
00:36:59.546 --> 00:37:02.266
to realize and to
say about it is

772
00:37:02.376 --> 00:37:07.256
that optimizing graphics is
totally what Metal is all about.

773
00:37:07.256 --> 00:37:09.076
But I'll get to Metal
in a second.

774
00:37:09.556 --> 00:37:12.566
I want to talk first just
about optimizing the games

775
00:37:12.566 --> 00:37:13.686
that are already out there.

776
00:37:14.396 --> 00:37:17.846
So, you know, every game
is different, right,

777
00:37:17.846 --> 00:37:21.466
and most of them are actually
pretty well optimized.

778
00:37:21.466 --> 00:37:22.036
They're okay.

779
00:37:22.346 --> 00:37:26.866
But in the games that are having
performance issues with OpenGL,

780
00:37:26.866 --> 00:37:30.666
it's usually because for some
portion of the frame, at least,

781
00:37:30.666 --> 00:37:33.646
or maybe all of the frame,
they're trying to do a lot

782
00:37:33.646 --> 00:37:36.786
of draw calls with a
low number of triangles

783
00:37:36.786 --> 00:37:38.806
to be processed in
each draw call.

784
00:37:39.736 --> 00:37:45.116
And the worst case scenario
is actually fairly common.

785
00:37:45.116 --> 00:37:46.096
I see it sometimes.

786
00:37:46.096 --> 00:37:49.056
It's particularly in
2D and isometric games

787
00:37:49.056 --> 00:37:50.356
that I'll find this sometimes.

788
00:37:50.716 --> 00:37:52.466
Is that they're just,
they're in a loop

789
00:37:52.466 --> 00:37:55.966
where they're binding a texture,
drawing a quad, and then repeat.

790
00:37:55.966 --> 00:37:57.506
Bind; draw; bind;
draw; bind; draw.

791
00:37:57.506 --> 00:38:01.656
And that's how they draw their
entire scene with one draw call

792
00:37:57.506 --> 00:38:01.656
And that's how they draw their
entire scene with one draw call

793
00:38:01.656 --> 00:38:04.786
for every quad, one texture
bind for every draw call.

794
00:38:05.846 --> 00:38:08.376
And, you know, for
OpenGL ES, there's just,

795
00:38:08.426 --> 00:38:12.046
there's a fair amount of CPU
overhead that's involved here

796
00:38:12.046 --> 00:38:15.276
in the validation and the
processing draw calls.

797
00:38:15.276 --> 00:38:19.166
So, you know, the theory behind
this becomes very important

798
00:38:19.246 --> 00:38:20.746
to optimize this.

799
00:38:21.006 --> 00:38:24.356
It's super important that
those developers find a way

800
00:38:24.356 --> 00:38:28.036
to amortize that overhead
over more triangles.

801
00:38:28.886 --> 00:38:33.066
Now, this is something that
I can help any of you with,

802
00:38:33.066 --> 00:38:36.996
and we have tons of people
in the lab this week.

803
00:38:36.996 --> 00:38:40.576
So if you're falling into this
situation, we can help you.

804
00:38:41.026 --> 00:38:44.816
But these 15 recommendations
that are up here cover most

805
00:38:44.816 --> 00:38:46.446
of the cases that I run into.

806
00:38:46.446 --> 00:38:50.616
This is the solutions that we
apply depending on the game,

807
00:38:50.616 --> 00:38:55.016
depending on the structure, and
what they're doing in OpenGL.

808
00:38:56.556 --> 00:38:59.286
But, and I'm not going to
go deep into any of these.

809
00:38:59.476 --> 00:39:03.426
But, so, more broadly,
what you need to realize is

810
00:38:59.476 --> 00:39:03.426
But, so, more broadly,
what you need to realize is

811
00:39:03.426 --> 00:39:07.436
that optimizing graphics
performance is really

812
00:39:07.666 --> 00:39:12.426
and primarily about identifying
the bottlenecks that you have

813
00:39:12.426 --> 00:39:15.786
and then addressing them, taking
some action to address them.

814
00:39:16.796 --> 00:39:19.496
Okay, so that lets me
talk about the tools.

815
00:39:19.496 --> 00:39:21.706
You know, we have
these fantastic tools

816
00:39:22.206 --> 00:39:25.126
that will help you
identify exactly

817
00:39:25.126 --> 00:39:27.076
where your performance
bottlenecks are

818
00:39:27.076 --> 00:39:28.966
and different bottlenecks
that might be happening.

819
00:39:29.576 --> 00:39:33.306
So this is a screenshot from the
GPU performance graphs in Xcode.

820
00:39:34.036 --> 00:39:38.026
And this, along with the
GPU frame debugger in Xcode

821
00:39:38.026 --> 00:39:40.636
and the OpenGL ES
analyzer instrument,

822
00:39:41.006 --> 00:39:42.436
are kind of the tools
of the trade

823
00:39:42.436 --> 00:39:44.366
that you should familiarize
yourself with here.

824
00:39:44.966 --> 00:39:46.156
So now let me zoom in.

825
00:39:47.116 --> 00:39:50.386
So what you see here: Section
at the top you see this sort

826
00:39:50.386 --> 00:39:53.506
of speedometer on the left up
at the top, the purple bars

827
00:39:53.506 --> 00:39:55.826
with utilization in the
middle that's showing me my

828
00:39:55.826 --> 00:39:57.256
GPU utilization.

829
00:39:57.256 --> 00:39:59.796
And then over here on the
right, the frame time,

830
00:40:00.086 --> 00:40:03.176
or how much time the CPU
is working on this frame,

831
00:40:03.176 --> 00:40:05.306
and how much time the GPU
is working on this frame.

832
00:40:06.186 --> 00:40:09.406
Now, in this particular
screenshot,

833
00:40:09.836 --> 00:40:12.266
this is a little different
than what I was just talking

834
00:40:12.266 --> 00:40:14.786
about with bind, draw,
bind, draw, bind, draw.

835
00:40:14.786 --> 00:40:18.376
In this one, what it is, I can
see the renderer utilization is

836
00:40:18.376 --> 00:40:21.626
at 100 percent and that's
pushing the device utilization

837
00:40:21.626 --> 00:40:22.636
up to 100 percent.

838
00:40:23.096 --> 00:40:25.246
And that is typically
a sign actually

839
00:40:25.246 --> 00:40:26.996
of a very expensive
fragment shader.

840
00:40:27.436 --> 00:40:30.736
Okay. And so down in the
bottom here, you can see,

841
00:40:30.886 --> 00:40:36.526
a view here now where I can-it's
showing me the cost of every one

842
00:40:36.526 --> 00:40:38.656
of my shaders that was
used in this frame.

843
00:40:38.936 --> 00:40:41.266
And I can turn down
these disclosures

844
00:40:41.546 --> 00:40:44.736
and see the specific draw
calls that use that shader

845
00:40:44.736 --> 00:40:46.836
and how much each one
of them cost as well.

846
00:40:48.146 --> 00:40:50.946
And, then, I can
also go and drill

847
00:40:50.946 --> 00:40:52.656
down into a particular shader.

848
00:40:52.656 --> 00:40:54.366
I'm not going to walk
you through all the UI.

849
00:40:54.366 --> 00:40:57.426
But once you get to the
view where you're looking

850
00:40:57.426 --> 00:41:00.426
that your shaders, if
I zoom that in again.

851
00:40:57.426 --> 00:41:00.426
that your shaders, if
I zoom that in again.

852
00:41:01.056 --> 00:41:05.066
Okay. So what this
is showing me now,

853
00:41:05.066 --> 00:41:07.856
look at on the right hand
side, these little bars.

854
00:41:08.616 --> 00:41:11.086
This is taken live
from the device.

855
00:41:11.086 --> 00:41:13.056
It's able to see the
performance data.

856
00:41:13.386 --> 00:41:16.046
And it's going line by
line through the shader

857
00:41:16.046 --> 00:41:18.686
to show you the performance
cost of each line.

858
00:41:19.036 --> 00:41:22.596
And so here I see that,
okay, 59 percent of the cost

859
00:41:22.876 --> 00:41:25.936
of this shader was going
into shadow projection.

860
00:41:25.936 --> 00:41:27.926
And that's probably
something I can optimize.

861
00:41:27.926 --> 00:41:30.206
I can use a lower resolution
shadow map or something.

862
00:41:30.616 --> 00:41:33.886
Because, remember, this was
the most expensive shader

863
00:41:34.096 --> 00:41:34.466
in the app.

864
00:41:35.126 --> 00:41:37.776
And the renderer utilization
was at 100 percent.

865
00:41:37.886 --> 00:41:41.616
So this is the bottleneck,
this shadow projection.

866
00:41:41.616 --> 00:41:43.646
And so it's exactly
what, in this case,

867
00:41:43.936 --> 00:41:45.156
needs to be optimized out.

868
00:41:45.896 --> 00:41:48.556
But, so the point, though,
is that the tools can be used

869
00:41:48.556 --> 00:41:52.026
to exactly pinpoint what's
going on in your app.

870
00:41:52.256 --> 00:41:54.976
Now, you know, if you're
not familiar with the tool

871
00:41:54.976 --> 00:41:58.546
or this isn't something that
you know your way around yet,

872
00:41:58.546 --> 00:41:59.606
just come down to the labs.

873
00:42:00.006 --> 00:42:01.866
We have so many people
down there who would love

874
00:42:01.866 --> 00:42:03.996
to help you to suss this out.

875
00:42:04.936 --> 00:42:07.086
But so, obviously, there's
an opportunity here, right,

876
00:42:07.136 --> 00:42:11.486
for OpenGL ES-based games to
kind of use the tools, optimize

877
00:42:11.486 --> 00:42:12.706
and get better performance.

878
00:42:12.756 --> 00:42:15.676
But I also want to be
super clear, you know,

879
00:42:15.676 --> 00:42:20.316
that seeing so many developers
struggle and face these kinds

880
00:42:20.316 --> 00:42:24.176
of issues are a big part
of the reason why SpriteKit

881
00:42:24.176 --> 00:42:26.396
and SceneKit were
developed, right.

882
00:42:26.696 --> 00:42:28.826
Their purpose is to provide you

883
00:42:28.826 --> 00:42:30.916
with the capabilities
that you need, right?

884
00:42:30.916 --> 00:42:34.876
2D games with SpriteKit,
3D games with SceneKit.

885
00:42:35.146 --> 00:42:38.116
Or now they can be
mixed together, right.

886
00:42:38.626 --> 00:42:41.546
But the real key is that
once you're using them

887
00:42:41.546 --> 00:42:43.726
and taking advantage
of their feature set,

888
00:42:44.136 --> 00:42:48.926
they take on the burden of
rendering optimally in OpenGL.

889
00:42:48.926 --> 00:42:50.716
And you don't have to
worry about it anymore.

890
00:42:51.666 --> 00:42:54.726
And, if you think about it,
one more step, you know,

891
00:42:54.726 --> 00:42:58.766
since Apple provides the
entire technology stack

892
00:42:58.766 --> 00:43:02.836
from these APIs all the
way down to the hardware,

893
00:42:58.766 --> 00:43:02.836
from these APIs all the
way down to the hardware,

894
00:43:03.176 --> 00:43:06.936
it means that everything can
be made very optimal in a way

895
00:43:06.936 --> 00:43:08.356
that you don't have to work on.

896
00:43:08.896 --> 00:43:13.156
And then, okay, speaking
of optimal, right.

897
00:43:13.356 --> 00:43:15.246
Now there's Metal, right.

898
00:43:15.476 --> 00:43:19.296
So this, this is for those
of you with games or engines

899
00:43:19.296 --> 00:43:22.546
that need to push a
lot more draw calls.

900
00:43:23.206 --> 00:43:27.156
And really allow your code
to have very efficient access

901
00:43:27.156 --> 00:43:31.576
to the GPU to interleave
graphics and compute, and so on.

902
00:43:31.576 --> 00:43:33.286
And really take control yourself

903
00:43:33.286 --> 00:43:35.616
over how the frame
is being rendered.

904
00:43:36.426 --> 00:43:39.546
So that is number seven:
optimize graphics performance.

905
00:43:41.326 --> 00:43:44.256
Okay, number eight: now,
we're lifting out of the tech

906
00:43:44.256 --> 00:43:46.206
in just a couple of
really kind of quick

907
00:43:46.206 --> 00:43:47.826
and light bits of advice here.

908
00:43:48.266 --> 00:43:50.136
This is a super quick one.

909
00:43:50.346 --> 00:43:52.526
It's to make a great
gameplay video.

910
00:43:52.946 --> 00:43:54.356
You know, so earlier
in the talk,

911
00:43:54.356 --> 00:43:55.386
I talked about the importance

912
00:43:55.386 --> 00:43:57.476
of making a really
great first impression.

913
00:43:57.796 --> 00:44:00.176
But what I didn't
really get into then was

914
00:43:57.796 --> 00:44:00.176
But what I didn't
really get into then was

915
00:44:00.176 --> 00:44:01.876
that from the user's
perspective,

916
00:44:01.876 --> 00:44:04.496
your player's perspective,
all of that is going

917
00:44:04.496 --> 00:44:05.896
to start on the App Store.

918
00:44:06.326 --> 00:44:09.186
And, you know, as we talked
about yesterday, you know,

919
00:44:09.186 --> 00:44:11.326
when people are really
coming on to the App Store,

920
00:44:11.326 --> 00:44:13.536
they're looking for
something that's cool and new.

921
00:44:13.536 --> 00:44:16.806
You know, they're going to be
looking for some way to kind

922
00:44:16.806 --> 00:44:19.396
of understand what
your game is doing.

923
00:44:19.396 --> 00:44:22.856
And you want to have something
that's going to stand out

924
00:44:23.566 --> 00:44:25.426
and exactly explain it.

925
00:44:25.946 --> 00:44:28.266
And so that they'll
be more confident

926
00:44:28.266 --> 00:44:30.386
and more ready to get your game.

927
00:44:31.586 --> 00:44:34.066
Okay. Now, as we talked
about a little bit yesterday,

928
00:44:34.066 --> 00:44:37.226
so in iOS 8, OS X
Yosemite, you'll be able

929
00:44:37.226 --> 00:44:39.556
to create these short
app previews

930
00:44:39.556 --> 00:44:41.626
or game previews
to demo your game.

931
00:44:42.086 --> 00:44:44.516
You should use this to show
how the game is played.

932
00:44:44.516 --> 00:44:45.156
You know, use it.

933
00:44:45.446 --> 00:44:48.316
Tell a story with
this and really appeal

934
00:44:48.316 --> 00:44:50.736
to what makes the
gameplay so much fun.

935
00:44:51.276 --> 00:44:54.686
You know, here's how it'll look
when it's on the App Store.

936
00:44:54.966 --> 00:44:58.146
We showed this "Monument
Valley" example yesterday.

937
00:44:58.146 --> 00:45:03.226
And how it works is just
the app preview just appears

938
00:44:58.146 --> 00:45:03.226
And how it works is just
the app preview just appears

939
00:45:03.696 --> 00:45:06.326
as the first image there
along with the screenshot.

940
00:45:06.736 --> 00:45:09.286
User taps on that, and they
can see this gameplay video.

941
00:45:09.816 --> 00:45:11.996
But now some details about this.

942
00:45:12.916 --> 00:45:15.926
Okay. So the app preview
needs to be, you know,

943
00:45:15.926 --> 00:45:17.276
a video of your gameplay.

944
00:45:17.276 --> 00:45:19.096
It's not intended to be an ad.

945
00:45:19.416 --> 00:45:23.086
It should convey the real
experience of playing the game.

946
00:45:23.516 --> 00:45:26.136
It can be up to 30 seconds long.

947
00:45:26.756 --> 00:45:30.846
You provide it as an H.264,
you know, MPEG4 encoded file

948
00:45:30.846 --> 00:45:32.506
that you upload into
iTunes Connect.

949
00:45:32.966 --> 00:45:36.136
You can have, or you should
have a different video

950
00:45:36.136 --> 00:45:38.126
for iPhone versus iPad.

951
00:45:38.166 --> 00:45:43.136
And your content itself can
be captured directly off

952
00:45:43.136 --> 00:45:47.216
of your iOS device and onto
your Mac that's running OS

953
00:45:47.246 --> 00:45:47.976
X Yosemite.

954
00:45:48.266 --> 00:45:51.346
The Mac just sees the iOS
device as a video camera.

955
00:45:51.666 --> 00:45:53.096
And you start playing the game,

956
00:45:53.096 --> 00:45:55.596
and you can capture it using
whatever tool you like:

957
00:45:55.636 --> 00:45:57.806
Quicktime Player, and so on.

958
00:45:57.806 --> 00:45:59.876
iMovie is where you
can do your editing.

959
00:45:59.876 --> 00:46:01.626
And then just put it
all together and get it

960
00:45:59.876 --> 00:46:01.626
And then just put it
all together and get it

961
00:46:01.626 --> 00:46:03.746
up on iTunes Connect,
and you're ready to go.

962
00:46:04.416 --> 00:46:07.636
And then this is really
just sort of one piece

963
00:46:07.636 --> 00:46:11.706
of building a great App
Store presence, right.

964
00:46:11.706 --> 00:46:14.956
So having a great icon,
compelling screenshots,

965
00:46:15.286 --> 00:46:19.506
localizations, description,
your keywords, and so on.

966
00:46:20.016 --> 00:46:23.066
Okay. So about app previews,
there's a whole session

967
00:46:23.066 --> 00:46:25.426
on it that's also on
Thursday afternoon.

968
00:46:25.426 --> 00:46:27.176
Check your schedule to see that.

969
00:46:28.366 --> 00:46:32.236
And make a great video
that's going to show players

970
00:46:32.236 --> 00:46:35.136
who are interested in your
game what the gameplay is

971
00:46:35.136 --> 00:46:35.626
really like.

972
00:46:35.626 --> 00:46:39.936
Okay. Number nine
is to localize.

973
00:46:40.836 --> 00:46:43.466
You know the App Store
is a global business.

974
00:46:43.856 --> 00:46:49.156
It's available in 155 countries
in 40 languages, right.

975
00:46:49.156 --> 00:46:53.456
So this, this is an opportunity
that is just phenomenal

976
00:46:53.686 --> 00:46:55.466
and you should think globally.

977
00:46:55.466 --> 00:46:57.956
You know, you need to think
about the distribution

978
00:46:57.956 --> 00:47:00.676
of your game as a
global opportunity.

979
00:46:57.956 --> 00:47:00.676
of your game as a
global opportunity.

980
00:47:02.766 --> 00:47:05.026
Now, so the first thing
that you should do,

981
00:47:05.026 --> 00:47:06.746
if you haven't already
done this,

982
00:47:07.066 --> 00:47:10.476
is to localize your App
Store presence, right.

983
00:47:11.016 --> 00:47:15.346
Just so that when a player in
some other region is coming in

984
00:47:15.346 --> 00:47:17.856
and looking at your game,
it just stands to reason

985
00:47:17.856 --> 00:47:19.996
that they'll be more
interested in it

986
00:47:20.336 --> 00:47:23.166
if they can read the description
of these other things

987
00:47:23.166 --> 00:47:24.996
in their native language, right.

988
00:47:24.996 --> 00:47:28.936
So localize the name, the
description, the keywords,

989
00:47:29.176 --> 00:47:32.826
the snapshots, and so on, right.

990
00:47:32.826 --> 00:47:35.606
And then the second
piece of this, of course,

991
00:47:35.606 --> 00:47:37.856
is to localize the
app content itself.

992
00:47:38.456 --> 00:47:42.556
So by that I mean to really go
back and structure your game

993
00:47:42.646 --> 00:47:44.136
for internationalization.

994
00:47:44.136 --> 00:47:46.216
You'll need to do what
you can to separate text

995
00:47:46.576 --> 00:47:48.856
from artwork and texture.

996
00:47:48.856 --> 00:47:51.446
So you don't have to
make copies of big images

997
00:47:51.446 --> 00:47:53.156
for every language
that you support.

998
00:47:53.256 --> 00:47:55.706
And then go through your UI.

999
00:47:56.366 --> 00:47:57.646
And, of course, right.

1000
00:47:57.646 --> 00:48:00.326
And translate the text into
all the different languages

1001
00:47:57.646 --> 00:48:00.326
And translate the text into
all the different languages

1002
00:48:00.326 --> 00:48:01.876
that you want to support.

1003
00:48:01.876 --> 00:48:05.226
And then, finally, you
know, also, consider things

1004
00:48:05.226 --> 00:48:07.106
like whether your game is right

1005
00:48:07.106 --> 00:48:10.286
to provide some culturalized
content

1006
00:48:10.416 --> 00:48:11.906
where it would be appropriate.

1007
00:48:12.286 --> 00:48:14.336
For example, if it
was a driving game,

1008
00:48:14.526 --> 00:48:16.596
maybe you would use
local road signs

1009
00:48:16.596 --> 00:48:18.326
for different locales and so on.

1010
00:48:18.676 --> 00:48:20.796
Local license plates
from different locales.

1011
00:48:23.216 --> 00:48:27.466
So, now, here's a list
of some of the languages

1012
00:48:27.466 --> 00:48:29.546
that we've recommended before.

1013
00:48:29.546 --> 00:48:31.466
It's certainly not exhaustive.

1014
00:48:31.466 --> 00:48:32.826
It's a big list.

1015
00:48:32.886 --> 00:48:34.746
And it's a good place
to start though.

1016
00:48:35.206 --> 00:48:38.046
So first is EFIGS,
right: English, French,

1017
00:48:38.046 --> 00:48:39.246
Italian, German, Spanish.

1018
00:48:39.856 --> 00:48:44.786
Then many regions in Asia, so
Japanese, Korean, Traditional

1019
00:48:44.786 --> 00:48:47.616
and Simplified Chinese, and
then branches out from there.

1020
00:48:47.616 --> 00:48:50.146
So Brazilian, Portuguese,
Russian, Turkish,

1021
00:48:50.146 --> 00:48:53.036
and Arabic are what
we would recommend

1022
00:48:53.036 --> 00:48:54.596
that you really put
some focus into.

1023
00:48:55.236 --> 00:48:57.796
And there's a great
resource online:

1024
00:48:57.936 --> 00:49:00.696
developer.apple.com/
internationalization.

1025
00:48:57.936 --> 00:49:00.696
developer.apple.com/
internationalization.

1026
00:49:01.156 --> 00:49:03.876
So this will take you step
by step through the process

1027
00:49:03.876 --> 00:49:07.326
of internationalizing and
localizing your app, your game.

1028
00:49:07.806 --> 00:49:12.486
And it gives you some links to
third party localization vendors

1029
00:49:12.486 --> 00:49:15.186
if you don't have that
expertise in-house.

1030
00:49:16.176 --> 00:49:19.096
But, so that is number
nine: to localize.

1031
00:49:19.496 --> 00:49:24.056
And so number 10: to
target the state of the art.

1032
00:49:25.266 --> 00:49:29.626
So if you think about some of
the best games that are on iOS,

1033
00:49:30.516 --> 00:49:32.686
you know, a real common
thread, as we've been saying,

1034
00:49:32.686 --> 00:49:35.466
is how they consistently
aim high

1035
00:49:35.466 --> 00:49:38.936
and consistently target
the latest and greatest

1036
00:49:39.006 --> 00:49:41.546
to differentiate
themselves on our devices.

1037
00:49:42.676 --> 00:49:46.956
So to be state-of-the-art
means really taking advantage

1038
00:49:46.956 --> 00:49:48.036
of the capabilities

1039
00:49:48.036 --> 00:49:50.896
of the latest hardware
like the A7, right.

1040
00:49:51.186 --> 00:49:54.226
And target the feature
set of those devices

1041
00:49:54.226 --> 00:49:55.866
so that you stand out.

1042
00:49:56.496 --> 00:50:00.566
I mean, you guys, you saw
those demos yesterday, right,

1043
00:49:56.496 --> 00:50:00.566
I mean, you guys, you saw
those demos yesterday, right,

1044
00:50:00.566 --> 00:50:02.366
during the "Keynote",
the "State of the Union".

1045
00:50:03.046 --> 00:50:04.686
They were on this hardware.

1046
00:50:04.856 --> 00:50:08.316
You know, you've
seen what it can do.

1047
00:50:08.656 --> 00:50:11.686
So take advantage
of that, that power,

1048
00:50:11.726 --> 00:50:14.626
that capability that's there.

1049
00:50:14.826 --> 00:50:17.616
Then hand in hand with
that, is that state

1050
00:50:17.616 --> 00:50:21.566
of the art apps support
the latest versions of iOS.

1051
00:50:22.816 --> 00:50:26.616
And I think that this week
should be that turning point

1052
00:50:26.616 --> 00:50:31.346
for you where it's time now for
you to realign your projects

1053
00:50:31.586 --> 00:50:36.376
to aim for the release of iOS 8
and the APIs and the frameworks

1054
00:50:36.376 --> 00:50:38.646
that you'll be learning
about all this week.

1055
00:50:38.956 --> 00:50:42.586
And then bring your
minimum OS up to iOS 7.

1056
00:50:43.066 --> 00:50:44.736
That is our recommendation.

1057
00:50:44.736 --> 00:50:47.776
Support the latest
N and N minus 1.

1058
00:50:48.156 --> 00:50:51.396
So when iOS 8 is released,
you'll probably want

1059
00:50:51.516 --> 00:50:53.116
to be looking at 7 and 8.

1060
00:50:54.276 --> 00:50:58.776
Okay. Now something, you know,
something that we do hear

1061
00:50:58.776 --> 00:51:01.346
from developers, actually more
often than you might think,

1062
00:50:58.776 --> 00:51:01.346
from developers, actually more
often than you might think,

1063
00:51:01.346 --> 00:51:05.886
is that they're telling us
that they'll, they're deciding

1064
00:51:05.886 --> 00:51:08.716
to stick with an older version
of Xcode or an older SDK

1065
00:51:08.716 --> 00:51:12.716
because they think that if
they move up to what's latest,

1066
00:51:13.106 --> 00:51:15.006
they won't be able
to still ship a game

1067
00:51:15.006 --> 00:51:17.336
that supports anything
older than that.

1068
00:51:17.846 --> 00:51:20.356
But obviously that's
not the case.

1069
00:51:21.066 --> 00:51:24.886
So you can adopt the latest SDK
version by setting your base SDK

1070
00:51:24.886 --> 00:51:29.026
to what is current and then
setting your deployment target

1071
00:51:29.026 --> 00:51:32.746
down to the lowest OS version
that you want to support

1072
00:51:33.056 --> 00:51:35.016
and dropping support
for the rest.

1073
00:51:35.716 --> 00:51:39.286
And then handle differences
between 7 and 8 in your code.

1074
00:51:39.386 --> 00:51:40.826
You know, check for
the existence

1075
00:51:41.146 --> 00:51:42.666
of hardware capabilities.

1076
00:51:42.996 --> 00:51:45.116
Or check whether
classes are defined.

1077
00:51:45.386 --> 00:51:47.086
Or check whether classes respond

1078
00:51:47.086 --> 00:51:49.016
to a particular selector
and so on.

1079
00:51:49.746 --> 00:51:52.116
Now for those of you who
are coming over to iOS

1080
00:51:52.116 --> 00:51:55.156
and are just not as
familiar with that process,

1081
00:51:55.296 --> 00:51:57.986
we actually went through
it all in pretty good depth

1082
00:51:58.556 --> 00:52:02.566
when we went out for our iOS
7 Tech Talks last November,

1083
00:51:58.556 --> 00:52:02.566
when we went out for our iOS
7 Tech Talks last November,

1084
00:52:02.566 --> 00:52:03.056
December.

1085
00:52:03.556 --> 00:52:06.926
And so those videos are online
on our developer website.

1086
00:52:06.926 --> 00:52:08.566
So you should check them out.

1087
00:52:10.376 --> 00:52:12.946
Then also, state of the
art games are the ones

1088
00:52:12.976 --> 00:52:15.876
that integrate with our
built in game technologies

1089
00:52:16.536 --> 00:52:19.186
as Geoff talked about.

1090
00:52:20.026 --> 00:52:24.186
So we're providing just this
incredible foundation for you.

1091
00:52:24.506 --> 00:52:27.866
It's built on a lot of different
APIs, you know, like SpriteKit,

1092
00:52:28.166 --> 00:52:32.446
Game Center, OpenGL, and
Game Controllers and so on.

1093
00:52:32.446 --> 00:52:36.426
And then the new APIs, like
Metal and SceneKit on iOS.

1094
00:52:37.316 --> 00:52:40.006
Right. And these are just
a few of the technologies.

1095
00:52:40.006 --> 00:52:40.976
You know this.

1096
00:52:41.616 --> 00:52:45.056
But the point I want to make
is about the other things.

1097
00:52:45.056 --> 00:52:48.746
You know, the tools and the
APIs that are available to you

1098
00:52:48.746 --> 00:52:52.606
as game developers is
comprehensive on iOS.

1099
00:52:53.436 --> 00:52:55.966
And you should learn
the entire stack.

1100
00:52:56.796 --> 00:52:59.056
Oh, my god, that's a
lot of learning to do.

1101
00:52:59.056 --> 00:53:02.676
But really what I mean is
to familiarize yourself

1102
00:52:59.056 --> 00:53:02.676
But really what I mean is
to familiarize yourself

1103
00:53:02.676 --> 00:53:06.066
with the technologies
that are on iOS rather

1104
00:53:06.066 --> 00:53:09.536
than just taking a project
that you were working on,

1105
00:53:09.766 --> 00:53:12.916
maybe on another platform
or on an older OS version,

1106
00:53:13.076 --> 00:53:16.526
and just shifting that over and
fitting it into the equivalent.

1107
00:53:17.116 --> 00:53:20.676
Your target should be to go
for the latest and greatest.

1108
00:53:20.736 --> 00:53:24.586
Target the top, target the
state of the art, target the A7,

1109
00:53:24.586 --> 00:53:28.236
target iOS 8 and its
capabilities, right,

1110
00:53:28.896 --> 00:53:31.766
rather than just coming
over and just fitting

1111
00:53:31.986 --> 00:53:33.806
in with something that's older.

1112
00:53:34.256 --> 00:53:38.066
But, so that's number 10:
target the state of the art.

1113
00:53:38.626 --> 00:53:40.796
But before I finish, I
do have one more thing

1114
00:53:40.796 --> 00:53:42.476
that I want to talk about.

1115
00:53:43.706 --> 00:53:47.346
So you know let's say that
you've done all 10 of these.

1116
00:53:47.346 --> 00:53:51.496
You've fixed your onboarding,
you tuned up your Core Loop,

1117
00:53:51.496 --> 00:53:53.036
you're optimized,
you're localized,

1118
00:53:53.036 --> 00:53:55.416
you're state-of-the-art,
etc., all 10.

1119
00:53:55.916 --> 00:53:58.856
So where do you go from here?

1120
00:53:59.076 --> 00:54:01.696
Yeah, well, go to 11.

1121
00:53:59.076 --> 00:54:01.696
Yeah, well, go to 11.

1122
00:54:02.796 --> 00:54:05.506
Really, give it that extra push.

1123
00:54:06.216 --> 00:54:07.686
Go the extra mile.

1124
00:54:08.126 --> 00:54:10.496
Because here is my
observation about this,

1125
00:54:11.226 --> 00:54:12.996
you know: We keep innovating.

1126
00:54:13.386 --> 00:54:16.066
We keep enhancing our
game technologies.

1127
00:54:16.206 --> 00:54:19.306
And we have this
thriving ecosystem, right,

1128
00:54:19.586 --> 00:54:20.716
where we're investing.

1129
00:54:20.956 --> 00:54:23.946
We're adding performance,
and we're adding capability.

1130
00:54:24.446 --> 00:54:26.566
You guys, you can't stand still.

1131
00:54:26.836 --> 00:54:28.246
Keep inventing.

1132
00:54:28.576 --> 00:54:29.346
Keep learning.

1133
00:54:29.746 --> 00:54:30.506
Keep current.

1134
00:54:30.946 --> 00:54:35.546
Get started on that next update
for iOS 8, and keep up with us

1135
00:54:35.906 --> 00:54:39.426
because we love to shine
the spotlight on developers

1136
00:54:39.426 --> 00:54:42.086
who can go one louder.

1137
00:54:43.186 --> 00:54:43.536
All right.

1138
00:54:44.056 --> 00:54:45.216
So thank you, everyone.

1139
00:54:45.316 --> 00:54:46.926
That is my list.

1140
00:54:47.516 --> 00:54:52.986
[ Applause ]

1141
00:54:53.486 --> 00:54:57.706
And just to wrap things up,
I'd like to pass the stage back

1142
00:54:57.706 --> 00:54:59.076
to Geoff for just a moment.

1143
00:54:59.076 --> 00:54:59.876
So thank you.

1144
00:55:06.456 --> 00:55:07.326
>> Thank you, Allan.

1145
00:55:09.376 --> 00:55:10.906
So thank you very much, Allan.

1146
00:55:11.226 --> 00:55:15.566
And I think, when I step
back and look at this,

1147
00:55:15.566 --> 00:55:16.686
we see a tremendous
amount of games.

1148
00:55:16.686 --> 00:55:18.116
You look around the room;
there's a lot of you

1149
00:55:18.116 --> 00:55:19.586
who are interested
in building games.

1150
00:55:19.906 --> 00:55:22.376
And there's a large number
of games in the App Store.

1151
00:55:22.376 --> 00:55:25.386
We're talking about how you
can make your game stand out.

1152
00:55:25.746 --> 00:55:27.746
It isn't good enough to
just go, "Oh, I'm going to.

1153
00:55:27.746 --> 00:55:28.396
I have a great idea.

1154
00:55:28.976 --> 00:55:29.596
It's a cool game.

1155
00:55:29.596 --> 00:55:32.316
I'm going to toss it up onto the
App Store and see what happens."

1156
00:55:32.316 --> 00:55:35.976
It is a very big pond, so
use what Allan has told you.

1157
00:55:35.976 --> 00:55:38.116
Use these 10 steps,
and use the 11th step.

1158
00:55:39.346 --> 00:55:41.216
And really make your game shine.

1159
00:55:41.656 --> 00:55:44.196
These are the things which may
not be apparent when you look

1160
00:55:44.196 --> 00:55:45.696
at it, it may not be
apparent when you look

1161
00:55:45.696 --> 00:55:48.976
at the Design Awards Winners
that they do these things.

1162
00:55:48.976 --> 00:55:51.116
But they really do, they
spend a lot of time.

1163
00:55:51.536 --> 00:55:52.816
"Cut the Rope" was
a great example.

1164
00:55:52.816 --> 00:55:55.916
Spent a lot of time on
going through with people

1165
00:55:55.916 --> 00:55:58.366
who haven't played the
game before and say, "Hey,

1166
00:55:58.666 --> 00:56:01.656
when you approach the game
what do you need to know?"

1167
00:55:58.666 --> 00:56:01.656
when you approach the game
what do you need to know?"

1168
00:56:01.876 --> 00:56:03.996
It's not just like that
came to them in an hour.

1169
00:56:04.366 --> 00:56:05.786
So take the time with your game.

1170
00:56:06.106 --> 00:56:07.666
Take the time to
go that extra mile.

1171
00:56:08.046 --> 00:56:10.856
Take the time to adopt
these 10 items and the 11th

1172
00:56:11.196 --> 00:56:14.326
and really bring your
content up so it stands out.

1173
00:56:14.326 --> 00:56:17.106
And we really hope to
see someone in this room

1174
00:56:17.106 --> 00:56:19.836
or many people in this
room on stage next year

1175
00:56:19.836 --> 00:56:20.846
at the Apple Design Awards.

1176
00:56:21.116 --> 00:56:22.446
Thank you very much
and enjoy the week.
