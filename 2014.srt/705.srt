1
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:13.486
>> Good morning, hello.

2
00:00:18.056 --> 00:00:22.696
Welcome to session 705,
Distributing Enterprise Apps.

3
00:00:23.746 --> 00:00:27.276
My name is Dave Rahardja,
I'm an iOS software engineer.

4
00:00:28.896 --> 00:00:32.256
So tell me if this
sounds familiar to you,

5
00:00:34.236 --> 00:00:39.286
you're in charge of a team
that's developing an iOS app

6
00:00:39.986 --> 00:00:43.486
for your business or
for your school, okay.

7
00:00:44.416 --> 00:00:50.166
You're in charge of everything
including managing developers,

8
00:00:50.656 --> 00:00:57.446
contractors, distributing apps
over MDM, making sure they run

9
00:00:58.046 --> 00:01:01.916
on a whole bunch of different
regions and make sure

10
00:00:58.046 --> 00:01:01.916
on a whole bunch of different
regions and make sure

11
00:01:01.916 --> 00:01:05.105
that it keeps running for
years and years to come.

12
00:01:05.876 --> 00:01:10.166
So if this sounds familiar to
you this session is for you.

13
00:01:11.076 --> 00:01:17.516
I want to give you a kind
of a comprehensive overview

14
00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:22.526
of everything that you need to
know to successfully develop

15
00:01:22.526 --> 00:01:27.776
and distribute and deploy an iOS
app in an enterprise setting.

16
00:01:29.216 --> 00:01:36.256
So we're going to do that by
focusing on four major areas

17
00:01:37.286 --> 00:01:40.766
that will sound familiar to
you if you've ever done this.

18
00:01:41.776 --> 00:01:48.846
First managing your team,
next using Xcode server

19
00:01:49.206 --> 00:01:50.946
to provide help for development,

20
00:01:53.116 --> 00:01:58.876
then some app distribution
strategies that will keep you

21
00:01:58.876 --> 00:02:06.006
in the clear for years and
finally custom B2B and how

22
00:01:58.876 --> 00:02:06.006
in the clear for years and
finally custom B2B and how

23
00:02:06.006 --> 00:02:09.056
that fits within your
organizations deployment plan.

24
00:02:10.515 --> 00:02:12.886
All right so four major topics,

25
00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:18.966
let's start with the first
one, managing your team.

26
00:02:19.156 --> 00:02:21.986
So let's start at
the very beginning,

27
00:02:22.886 --> 00:02:25.396
how do you get started
developing enterprise apps

28
00:02:25.396 --> 00:02:25.676
at all?

29
00:02:26.376 --> 00:02:28.066
Well, it's really simple,

30
00:02:28.706 --> 00:02:34.356
you need an enterprise
developer account, it use to be

31
00:02:34.356 --> 00:02:38.066
that we had a 500
member...500 employee limit

32
00:02:38.436 --> 00:02:42.676
for enterprise app
accounts, that's gone,

33
00:02:42.976 --> 00:02:48.146
no minimum company size as long
as you have a D-U-N-S number

34
00:02:48.496 --> 00:02:50.696
for your enterprise
you are eligible.

35
00:02:51.166 --> 00:02:55.106
This program is 299 a year.

36
00:02:59.896 --> 00:03:04.096
To get started you need
to create an agent account

37
00:02:59.896 --> 00:03:04.096
To get started you need
to create an agent account

38
00:03:05.236 --> 00:03:10.656
and then add admins and team
members to the developer portal.

39
00:03:13.416 --> 00:03:19.046
So let's talk about these
roles, an agent is a person

40
00:03:19.296 --> 00:03:24.296
who is authorized to accept
legal terms with respect

41
00:03:24.336 --> 00:03:26.746
to the developer program.

42
00:03:28.676 --> 00:03:34.776
Admins manage team members
and they prepare apps

43
00:03:35.116 --> 00:03:38.076
for distribution, there
can only be one agent

44
00:03:38.716 --> 00:03:43.616
but multiple admins, team
members are those people

45
00:03:43.616 --> 00:03:47.056
who actually develop and
test code under the program.

46
00:03:48.736 --> 00:03:55.376
Because agents and admins
are able to produce things

47
00:03:55.376 --> 00:03:58.936
that represent your company
so agents sign contracts,

48
00:03:59.336 --> 00:04:03.126
admins publish apps with your
code signing certificate.

49
00:03:59.336 --> 00:04:03.126
admins publish apps with your
code signing certificate.

50
00:04:04.136 --> 00:04:08.926
They should be employees
of your enterprise,

51
00:04:12.756 --> 00:04:17.486
team members however can
be employees or contractors

52
00:04:17.916 --> 00:04:21.836
and we'll talk about the kind of
a work flow here for contractors

53
00:04:21.836 --> 00:04:27.136
in a minute but first
let's talk about admins.

54
00:04:27.896 --> 00:04:33.156
So admins can add and remove
team members from your roster,

55
00:04:33.686 --> 00:04:38.106
they can create app ID's
in the developer portal,

56
00:04:39.826 --> 00:04:43.566
they can request push
certificates for those app ID's,

57
00:04:44.116 --> 00:04:48.216
they can add devices to the team
development provisioning profile

58
00:04:48.216 --> 00:04:52.746
which everybody else in the team
including the team members use

59
00:04:52.746 --> 00:04:56.356
to actually do debugging
on iOS hardware,

60
00:04:58.096 --> 00:05:02.216
they get to manage the
distribution code signing

61
00:04:58.096 --> 00:05:02.216
they get to manage the
distribution code signing

62
00:05:02.216 --> 00:05:04.846
certificate which is
a special certificate,

63
00:05:05.186 --> 00:05:06.886
a code signing certificate
that you need

64
00:05:07.156 --> 00:05:09.946
in order to publish the app.

65
00:05:11.556 --> 00:05:14.086
They also create
the distribution

66
00:05:14.366 --> 00:05:15.916
provisioning profiles.

67
00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:18.916
This is in contrast to the
development provisional profile

68
00:05:18.916 --> 00:05:20.566
which is automatically
managed by Xcode.

69
00:05:21.086 --> 00:05:27.136
And finally they are the ones
who package the actual apps

70
00:05:27.186 --> 00:05:28.776
for final distribution.

71
00:05:29.886 --> 00:05:33.936
So as you can tell admins have
a lot of power in this program,

72
00:05:34.726 --> 00:05:39.186
most of the administrative
tasks with respect to developing

73
00:05:39.186 --> 00:05:42.216
and distributing apps
fall under admin accounts.

74
00:05:44.476 --> 00:05:47.306
Team members are coders

75
00:05:47.346 --> 00:05:51.986
and testers they should have
their own personal code signing

76
00:05:51.986 --> 00:05:55.046
certificate, each one should
have their own code signing

77
00:05:55.046 --> 00:05:58.786
certificate, don't share your
private keys between developers.

78
00:05:59.506 --> 00:06:02.606
During the development cycle

79
00:05:59.506 --> 00:06:02.606
During the development cycle

80
00:06:02.606 --> 00:06:05.176
if a developer loses their
private key you could just

81
00:06:05.176 --> 00:06:08.456
create another one as long as
nobody is using an older version

82
00:06:08.616 --> 00:06:13.526
of an app that they
produced it's fine,

83
00:06:13.746 --> 00:06:14.636
just create a new one,

84
00:06:15.556 --> 00:06:17.326
don't share the code
signing certificates.

85
00:06:18.626 --> 00:06:23.796
Use the team development
provisioning profile to debug

86
00:06:23.796 --> 00:06:26.796
on iOS hardware and this is
done automatically by Xcode

87
00:06:27.146 --> 00:06:28.816
if you set up Xcode
correctly you never have

88
00:06:28.846 --> 00:06:30.226
to worry about this.

89
00:06:31.196 --> 00:06:34.516
Team members can distribute
apps to a limited extent,

90
00:06:35.106 --> 00:06:37.346
they can create ad-hoc
distributions

91
00:06:37.946 --> 00:06:42.596
which are app bundles...app
packages

92
00:06:42.596 --> 00:06:45.026
that can be run only
on test devices.

93
00:06:45.716 --> 00:06:48.776
This is great for QA for
example or alpha testing

94
00:06:49.326 --> 00:06:52.536
but they cannot be run outside

95
00:06:52.536 --> 00:06:54.256
of their own little
group of devices.

96
00:06:54.936 --> 00:07:02.906
Now contractors, many of us have
contractors that come in and out

97
00:06:54.936 --> 00:07:02.906
Now contractors, many of us have
contractors that come in and out

98
00:07:02.906 --> 00:07:04.186
of our development circle,

99
00:07:05.156 --> 00:07:10.686
so the way that you should treat
contractors is they should be

100
00:07:11.156 --> 00:07:13.746
enrolled as team
members in your program,

101
00:07:15.036 --> 00:07:18.056
you should invite them
using their e-mail address

102
00:07:18.986 --> 00:07:21.216
and then they should get their
own code signing certificate,

103
00:07:21.736 --> 00:07:23.086
just like any other team member.

104
00:07:23.676 --> 00:07:27.296
At the end of their
contract simply remove them

105
00:07:27.296 --> 00:07:32.486
from the member portal
and that's it,

106
00:07:33.176 --> 00:07:34.876
you'll invalidate the
code signing certificate,

107
00:07:34.876 --> 00:07:38.746
they can get another one for
another project next time.

108
00:07:38.946 --> 00:07:42.086
All right so let's walk
through a little flow

109
00:07:42.086 --> 00:07:46.226
of inviting a team member
including contractors

110
00:07:46.646 --> 00:07:48.736
to join your development team,

111
00:07:48.996 --> 00:07:53.446
so here we have the developer
website here member center

112
00:07:54.436 --> 00:07:56.596
and we have a list of people

113
00:07:57.086 --> 00:08:00.846
in your development team
including some admins

114
00:07:57.086 --> 00:08:00.846
in your development team
including some admins

115
00:08:00.846 --> 00:08:08.156
and some members, what you do
is click on the invitations icon

116
00:08:08.156 --> 00:08:11.336
in the site bar and
you'll see this.

117
00:08:12.296 --> 00:08:14.246
You can invite one
or a bunch of people

118
00:08:14.246 --> 00:08:19.046
into your development team
at once, click invite person,

119
00:08:20.346 --> 00:08:23.966
enter the name and
e-mail address,

120
00:08:24.966 --> 00:08:26.286
this is just an e-mail
address it doesn't have

121
00:08:26.316 --> 00:08:28.106
to be their Apple ID
because any e-mail address

122
00:08:28.106 --> 00:08:29.486
that they can be reached at.

123
00:08:29.986 --> 00:08:35.385
And they will get something
like this so you've been invited

124
00:08:35.385 --> 00:08:37.196
to join the Apple
developer program,

125
00:08:37.956 --> 00:08:42.106
so the reason they don't
have to receive this e-mail

126
00:08:42.106 --> 00:08:44.826
over Apple ID is
because when they click

127
00:08:44.826 --> 00:08:49.626
on that blue underlined link
there they will be taken

128
00:08:49.966 --> 00:08:52.496
to this portal where
they can then sign

129
00:08:52.496 --> 00:08:55.176
in with their actual
developer ID.

130
00:08:56.076 --> 00:08:58.296
If they're already a developer

131
00:08:58.296 --> 00:09:02.456
like the 99 dollar app developer
they can click the top button

132
00:08:58.296 --> 00:09:02.456
like the 99 dollar app developer
they can click the top button

133
00:09:03.116 --> 00:09:06.096
and log in with that,
if they're not part

134
00:09:06.096 --> 00:09:10.086
of any development program they
can click on the register button

135
00:09:10.346 --> 00:09:14.056
on the bottom and they will get
access to the developer tools

136
00:09:14.546 --> 00:09:17.216
and the rights as a
developer by virtue

137
00:09:17.216 --> 00:09:22.536
of joining your team, okay.

138
00:09:22.726 --> 00:09:27.116
Once you do that the
next thing you should do

139
00:09:27.116 --> 00:09:30.726
as a team member
is to go to Xcode

140
00:09:30.726 --> 00:09:35.336
and type your registered Apple
ID in, so you click register,

141
00:09:35.336 --> 00:09:39.256
you register as a new developer
for example, go to Xcode,

142
00:09:40.036 --> 00:09:43.426
hit your preferences, go
to accounts and add this.

143
00:09:43.816 --> 00:09:49.436
This is the key to having a
really nice flow of artifacts

144
00:09:49.586 --> 00:09:53.946
between your team members,
you admins using Xcode.

145
00:09:54.956 --> 00:10:01.566
When you log in Xcode will show
you what development teams you

146
00:09:54.956 --> 00:10:01.566
When you log in Xcode will show
you what development teams you

147
00:10:01.566 --> 00:10:03.736
belong to down there
on the bottom right,

148
00:10:04.396 --> 00:10:06.866
in this case Ann is a member

149
00:10:06.866 --> 00:10:11.646
of the business markets
enterprise program team.

150
00:10:12.166 --> 00:10:20.996
When you click on view details
you will see this so you start

151
00:10:20.996 --> 00:10:23.136
out with no code signing
identities of course

152
00:10:23.616 --> 00:10:26.906
and no provisioning
profiles, the first thing

153
00:10:26.906 --> 00:10:30.706
that the new team member should
do is to click the plus button

154
00:10:31.416 --> 00:10:35.596
and request a new
iOS development code

155
00:10:35.596 --> 00:10:37.566
signing certificate.

156
00:10:40.556 --> 00:10:43.166
When they do that
all of the admins

157
00:10:43.166 --> 00:10:47.496
of the team will see
this, they will see

158
00:10:47.496 --> 00:10:49.936
that Ann has a requested a
code signing certificate,

159
00:10:50.526 --> 00:10:54.576
all you got to do is hit approve

160
00:10:54.756 --> 00:11:00.126
and Xcode will get the
signing certificate installed

161
00:10:54.756 --> 00:11:00.126
and Xcode will get the
signing certificate installed

162
00:11:00.126 --> 00:11:02.366
on your team member
team member's computer.

163
00:11:03.876 --> 00:11:07.006
The same goes for
provisioning profiles,

164
00:11:07.666 --> 00:11:09.846
when they refresh their
provisioning profiles

165
00:11:09.846 --> 00:11:13.006
after they've done this they
will get the latest iOS team

166
00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:16.696
provisioning profile, so most
of this, once you've set this

167
00:11:16.696 --> 00:11:20.266
up much of the details
is taken care

168
00:11:20.266 --> 00:11:23.026
of for the developer by Xcode.

169
00:11:24.396 --> 00:11:32.006
All right so let's switch gears
a little bit so once you set

170
00:11:32.006 --> 00:11:33.996
that up you can actually
start developing.

171
00:11:34.706 --> 00:11:39.956
But what I want to recommend
for your admins to do is

172
00:11:39.956 --> 00:11:42.686
to create app ID's
right at the beginning

173
00:11:42.686 --> 00:11:44.016
of your app development cycle.

174
00:11:45.006 --> 00:11:49.756
So if you want to develop
you know some an app

175
00:11:49.756 --> 00:11:52.686
and you have some app
in mind go ahead and go

176
00:11:52.686 --> 00:11:56.226
to the developer portal here
and click on certificates,

177
00:11:56.226 --> 00:11:57.786
identifiers and profiles.

178
00:11:59.716 --> 00:12:07.066
Click on app ID's and plus
and create your new app ID.

179
00:11:59.716 --> 00:12:07.066
Click on app ID's and plus
and create your new app ID.

180
00:12:07.646 --> 00:12:11.886
Create this at the beginning
of your development cycle

181
00:12:12.696 --> 00:12:16.586
and I'll tell you
why in a second.

182
00:12:16.696 --> 00:12:19.366
Use the team ID prefix
for your app,

183
00:12:20.206 --> 00:12:23.756
there may be some legacy entries
if you were a developer before,

184
00:12:24.156 --> 00:12:26.406
don't use those use
the team prefix

185
00:12:26.406 --> 00:12:32.596
that will get you the happiest
path and use an explicit app ID,

186
00:12:32.596 --> 00:12:36.506
you should no longer
use wild card app ID's

187
00:12:36.916 --> 00:12:39.256
because this will get
you a lot more features

188
00:12:40.016 --> 00:12:41.916
if you use an explicit app ID.

189
00:12:42.666 --> 00:12:46.426
So the reason that I asked
admins to create app ID's

190
00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:49.436
at the beginning of the
development cycle is

191
00:12:49.436 --> 00:12:52.996
because many of the apps
developed today require

192
00:12:52.996 --> 00:12:56.346
entitlements in their
provisioning profile,

193
00:12:56.846 --> 00:12:59.806
so you have iCloud entitlements,

194
00:13:00.206 --> 00:13:03.946
for extensions you would need
special entitlements sometimes

195
00:13:04.036 --> 00:13:08.576
and if your app needs push
notifications you would need

196
00:13:08.576 --> 00:13:11.706
to have an app ID registered
first before you can get a push

197
00:13:11.706 --> 00:13:13.456
certificate, etcetera, etcetera.

198
00:13:13.756 --> 00:13:18.366
So because many of the apps
that we develop today use a lot

199
00:13:18.366 --> 00:13:25.196
of modern additions that need
provisioning it's usually easier

200
00:13:25.196 --> 00:13:27.416
to just enter the app ID first

201
00:13:27.416 --> 00:13:29.556
and then just keep
checking boxes as you need

202
00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:33.156
on the developer
portal, that's why.

203
00:13:33.706 --> 00:13:42.226
So in summary enroll in iOS
developer enterprise program

204
00:13:42.286 --> 00:13:46.006
to begin development,
you're agents

205
00:13:46.166 --> 00:13:48.146
and your admins should
be employees.

206
00:13:48.746 --> 00:13:53.116
Your contractors can be
treated as team members,

207
00:13:54.596 --> 00:13:56.616
you should invite
your team members

208
00:13:56.756 --> 00:13:59.766
as you create your program

209
00:13:59.856 --> 00:14:02.246
and you should approve
their code signing

210
00:13:59.856 --> 00:14:02.246
and you should approve
their code signing

211
00:14:02.246 --> 00:14:03.736
certificate requests.

212
00:14:04.396 --> 00:14:07.846
Remember each team member should
have their own code signing

213
00:14:07.846 --> 00:14:12.626
certificate and best
practice create your app ID's

214
00:14:12.626 --> 00:14:14.526
at the beginning of
the development cycle

215
00:14:15.446 --> 00:14:19.226
that gives you the most leverage
as you continue to use features

216
00:14:19.226 --> 00:14:20.616
that require entitlements.

217
00:14:22.216 --> 00:14:26.356
So that's managing your
team, I hope that's helpful,

218
00:14:27.126 --> 00:14:29.926
next I'd like to talk
about Xcode server,

219
00:14:30.496 --> 00:14:34.056
Xcode server is a great
hub for development.

220
00:14:35.186 --> 00:14:38.416
To install Xcode
server all you have

221
00:14:38.416 --> 00:14:43.776
to do is install the OS X
server from the Mac App Store

222
00:14:43.776 --> 00:14:46.796
and then install Xcode
on the same machine.

223
00:14:47.326 --> 00:14:51.326
When this happens a
new entry will show

224
00:14:51.326 --> 00:14:56.886
up in your server dot app side
bar to enable Xcode service.

225
00:14:57.726 --> 00:15:00.936
So here's how you set it up
for enterprise development,

226
00:14:57.726 --> 00:15:00.936
So here's how you set it up
for enterprise development,

227
00:15:01.576 --> 00:15:07.666
the first thing you want
to do if you want to log

228
00:15:07.666 --> 00:15:14.326
in with your enterprise account
on Xcode server, so edit that,

229
00:15:15.166 --> 00:15:20.416
log in, you can log in with any
admin account on Xcode server.

230
00:15:21.306 --> 00:15:28.056
When you do this, the Xcode
server will get its own code

231
00:15:28.056 --> 00:15:31.726
signing certificate,
all right so if you look

232
00:15:31.726 --> 00:15:33.616
at the key chain there
it is that's a servers,

233
00:15:33.616 --> 00:15:34.246
it doesn't belong

234
00:15:34.246 --> 00:15:37.576
to any developer it's a servers
own code signing certificate

235
00:15:38.476 --> 00:15:43.516
and this means that the server
can produce app packages for you

236
00:15:43.906 --> 00:15:46.806
and we'll see how that can
be useful in a few minutes.

237
00:15:47.686 --> 00:15:51.936
Once you're logged in you
should create a user for each

238
00:15:51.976 --> 00:15:57.216
of you admin and team
members on OS X server.

239
00:15:57.726 --> 00:16:02.206
You don't have to give
them home directories,

240
00:15:57.726 --> 00:16:02.206
You don't have to give
them home directories,

241
00:16:02.526 --> 00:16:05.876
you can select services only

242
00:16:06.306 --> 00:16:08.496
so this basically
creates directory entries

243
00:16:08.556 --> 00:16:09.666
for your team members.

244
00:16:10.356 --> 00:16:13.166
This greatly facilitates
the rest of the past

245
00:16:13.906 --> 00:16:17.986
because you can create
groups out of these entries

246
00:16:18.606 --> 00:16:24.196
and then create access
controls based on that group.

247
00:16:24.196 --> 00:16:30.396
All right so that's really
it for OS X for Xcode server

248
00:16:30.396 --> 00:16:34.186
on OS X until later
we'll talk about bots.

249
00:16:35.656 --> 00:16:37.156
Let's talk about
code repositories,

250
00:16:38.426 --> 00:16:45.266
so you can create
code repositories

251
00:16:45.266 --> 00:16:51.176
on Xcode server also, we
support git or subversion,

252
00:16:52.556 --> 00:16:56.676
I can recommend git these days,

253
00:16:57.046 --> 00:17:00.816
you should create one
repository per app and because

254
00:16:57.046 --> 00:17:00.816
you should create one
repository per app and because

255
00:17:00.816 --> 00:17:01.866
that makes it easier

256
00:17:01.866 --> 00:17:03.896
to integrate your code
repository trigger

257
00:17:03.946 --> 00:17:09.336
with bots later on and create
access controls on the server,

258
00:17:09.336 --> 00:17:10.746
it really is very
simple, all you have

259
00:17:10.746 --> 00:17:11.996
to do is hit the plus button,

260
00:17:12.316 --> 00:17:15.536
create a repository,
it's that simple.

261
00:17:15.536 --> 00:17:20.685
Now on your developers machine
you can actually add a server

262
00:17:20.685 --> 00:17:24.646
as its own entry under your
preferences, under your accounts

263
00:17:25.076 --> 00:17:28.156
so here's a server, if
the server is visible

264
00:17:28.156 --> 00:17:31.856
on Bonjour it will show
up here, add that server

265
00:17:32.246 --> 00:17:36.786
to your Xcode environment
and you will get this,

266
00:17:38.196 --> 00:17:43.536
check out an existing project
on your Xcode welcome screen.

267
00:17:45.266 --> 00:17:49.256
When you click that Xcode will
automatically reach the server

268
00:17:49.576 --> 00:17:53.766
and figure out what repositories
you have access to and this is

269
00:17:53.766 --> 00:17:58.696
where all the accounts
come into play click that

270
00:17:58.696 --> 00:18:02.686
and you're good to go.

271
00:17:58.696 --> 00:18:02.686
and you're good to go.

272
00:18:02.806 --> 00:18:06.886
So bots, so a great feature

273
00:18:07.106 --> 00:18:13.626
of Xcode server is
bots, so what are bots?

274
00:18:14.716 --> 00:18:20.996
Give you continuous integration
they will run units tests

275
00:18:21.036 --> 00:18:23.476
on devices connected
to the Xcode server,

276
00:18:24.056 --> 00:18:29.346
it will generate reports
and create archives for QA.

277
00:18:29.986 --> 00:18:34.096
So I'm going to walk you
through how you create a bot

278
00:18:34.756 --> 00:18:35.866
using Xcode.

279
00:18:36.986 --> 00:18:41.146
So anyone can create a bot, it
doesn't have to be an admin.

280
00:18:41.316 --> 00:18:43.276
as long as you have
rights on Xcode server,

281
00:18:44.266 --> 00:18:45.726
the first thing you
want to do when you want

282
00:18:45.726 --> 00:18:48.826
to create a bot is open the
project that you are interested

283
00:18:48.826 --> 00:18:54.996
in and create a share scheme,
go here, click manage schemes.

284
00:18:56.326 --> 00:19:00.306
Most of the time you already
have a scheme that you want

285
00:18:56.326 --> 00:19:00.306
Most of the time you already
have a scheme that you want

286
00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:04.196
to use as a template for
the bots scheme so go ahead

287
00:19:04.196 --> 00:19:08.786
and duplicate that scheme right
there and call it integration

288
00:19:08.786 --> 00:19:13.666
for instance and make sure that
the shared check box is checked,

289
00:19:14.156 --> 00:19:19.866
it has to be shared and
remember to commit the scheme

290
00:19:19.866 --> 00:19:22.426
to your server with the
source control and check it

291
00:19:22.426 --> 00:19:24.916
in otherwise of course the
server can't see the scheme

292
00:19:24.916 --> 00:19:25.546
that you've just made.

293
00:19:26.036 --> 00:19:30.256
Next on the server
connect your test devices

294
00:19:30.996 --> 00:19:35.126
so if you plug an iOS device
into an OS server it will show

295
00:19:35.126 --> 00:19:37.326
up here, it will show
up at the bottom.

296
00:19:38.266 --> 00:19:43.046
If you click on add the team
Xcode server will take your

297
00:19:43.046 --> 00:19:44.686
device and automatically add

298
00:19:44.756 --> 00:19:46.406
that to your provisioning
profiles.

299
00:19:46.736 --> 00:19:50.406
The rapid device you did
go to the developer portal

300
00:19:51.026 --> 00:19:54.606
and create a new development
provision and profile

301
00:19:54.606 --> 00:19:56.586
which can then be downloaded
by your team members

302
00:19:57.186 --> 00:20:00.376
so why do you want to connect
test devices to the server?

303
00:19:57.186 --> 00:20:00.376
so why do you want to connect
test devices to the server?

304
00:20:01.146 --> 00:20:04.816
This device is actually
used for the unit test,

305
00:20:04.986 --> 00:20:07.356
they'll actually run the
unit test on the device.

306
00:20:08.306 --> 00:20:12.946
So connect a variety of test
devices if you can, an iPad,

307
00:20:12.946 --> 00:20:16.556
iPod touch, iPhone to get the
best coverage for your tests

308
00:20:18.006 --> 00:20:21.156
and like I said the development
provisioning profile is

309
00:20:21.156 --> 00:20:24.476
automatically updated
actually connect new devices

310
00:20:24.866 --> 00:20:27.206
and add them the portal.

311
00:20:28.656 --> 00:20:32.946
Once you've done that back
to Xcode, create your bot,

312
00:20:34.276 --> 00:20:38.836
under product remember this is
you still have the project open

313
00:20:38.896 --> 00:20:40.646
that you're interested
in creating the bot for,

314
00:20:41.346 --> 00:20:47.436
under product go to create bots,
under the create bots dialogue,

315
00:20:47.496 --> 00:20:49.346
choose the scheme
that you've just made,

316
00:20:49.836 --> 00:20:51.306
the dash it all integration
scheme

317
00:20:51.876 --> 00:20:54.216
and call the bot give
a name to the bot,

318
00:20:54.466 --> 00:20:56.856
so we have here dash it
all commitment integration

319
00:20:57.066 --> 00:21:00.166
so for this example
we want the bot to run

320
00:20:57.066 --> 00:21:00.166
so for this example
we want the bot to run

321
00:21:00.596 --> 00:21:06.806
when a new commit is made to
the repository and that's it.

322
00:21:08.226 --> 00:21:13.296
You can choose when you want
to perform the operation,

323
00:21:13.856 --> 00:21:17.386
you can choose what actions
you want to do, analyze, test,

324
00:21:17.386 --> 00:21:22.546
archive and which devices
you want to run this bot on.

325
00:21:27.076 --> 00:21:29.736
Bot creation succeeded
and the bot is ready

326
00:21:29.736 --> 00:21:30.886
to use, it's that simple.

327
00:21:30.886 --> 00:21:33.196
So what do you get?

328
00:21:33.796 --> 00:21:39.186
When the bot runs it keeps a
data base of its run status

329
00:21:39.186 --> 00:21:44.016
and results so you can see
the history off the builds,

330
00:21:44.186 --> 00:21:47.166
which builds failed and
passed, you can see how many

331
00:21:47.166 --> 00:21:51.056
of your units have passed and
failed, you can even see this

332
00:21:51.156 --> 00:21:55.786
on a web browser by going to
the servername/Xcode/bots.

333
00:21:56.526 --> 00:22:00.676
Your bot will produce
these results,

334
00:21:56.526 --> 00:22:00.676
Your bot will produce
these results,

335
00:22:01.376 --> 00:22:03.896
it will produce test results,
unit test pass and fails,

336
00:22:04.886 --> 00:22:06.476
static analysis results.

337
00:22:07.466 --> 00:22:11.616
It will produce logs from
your build and test sessions,

338
00:22:12.006 --> 00:22:15.416
it will produce extra
project archives

339
00:22:15.416 --> 00:22:18.696
so you know exactly what code
got compiled for that run.

340
00:22:19.186 --> 00:22:23.546
And here's where the servers
code signing comes into play.

341
00:22:24.166 --> 00:22:27.946
The bots will actually use Xcode
servers code signing certificate

342
00:22:28.236 --> 00:22:32.376
to create ad-hoc
signed app packages

343
00:22:32.776 --> 00:22:36.376
which QA can then download
straight from the web server

344
00:22:36.686 --> 00:22:39.196
or Xcode and install
on their own devices

345
00:22:39.196 --> 00:22:43.186
to do regression testing,
it's great for QA.

346
00:22:44.236 --> 00:22:47.406
That's Xcode server, it's
a hub for development,

347
00:22:48.656 --> 00:22:52.086
install OS X server and
Xcode on the same machine,

348
00:22:53.436 --> 00:22:55.006
sign in with your
enterprise account,

349
00:22:55.306 --> 00:22:59.186
any admin account will do, host
your code repository there,

350
00:23:00.606 --> 00:23:03.226
connect your test
devices and use bots

351
00:23:03.486 --> 00:23:04.726
for continuous integration.

352
00:23:06.046 --> 00:23:08.666
It's a great hub for
your development needs,

353
00:23:08.796 --> 00:23:11.476
that's Xcode server, all right.

354
00:23:12.646 --> 00:23:13.836
App distribution strategy,

355
00:23:14.416 --> 00:23:18.316
distribution provisioning
profiles, when you're ready

356
00:23:18.386 --> 00:23:20.466
to publish your app
and distribute them

357
00:23:20.606 --> 00:23:23.156
to your enterprise
members you need

358
00:23:23.156 --> 00:23:26.156
to create a distribution
provisioning profile.

359
00:23:26.486 --> 00:23:30.306
The way you do that is go
to the developer portal,

360
00:23:30.306 --> 00:23:33.946
certificate identifiers and
profiles again and click

361
00:23:33.946 --> 00:23:36.556
on the distribution
item on the side bar.

362
00:23:38.876 --> 00:23:42.106
Then next step click in
house so this is available

363
00:23:42.106 --> 00:23:43.406
for enterprise accounts,

364
00:23:44.076 --> 00:23:47.156
in house distribution will
allow you to run your app

365
00:23:47.736 --> 00:23:51.086
that you signed on any
devices without limit of UDID.

366
00:23:53.796 --> 00:23:58.526
Select your app ID that you've
provisioned before right there

367
00:23:59.086 --> 00:24:03.306
and that's it.

368
00:23:59.086 --> 00:24:03.306
and that's it.

369
00:24:04.576 --> 00:24:08.756
You can download the
provisioning profile and then go

370
00:24:08.756 --> 00:24:14.426
to Xcode and open the
project and see archive,

371
00:24:15.056 --> 00:24:19.066
product archive right there.

372
00:24:19.276 --> 00:24:22.896
When you click archive the
project will be archived

373
00:24:23.196 --> 00:24:26.236
and will be ready to
distribute, it is not ready

374
00:24:26.236 --> 00:24:28.936
to distribute yet, you
need to do one more step,

375
00:24:29.116 --> 00:24:34.456
you need to click distribute
and save for enterprise

376
00:24:34.696 --> 00:24:38.536
or ad-hoc deployment
right there.

377
00:24:41.576 --> 00:24:45.346
Then choose the provisioning
profile the provisioning profile

378
00:24:45.346 --> 00:24:48.866
that you've just created, not
the team provisioning profile

379
00:24:48.866 --> 00:24:52.046
but this one the in house
provisioning profile,

380
00:24:52.246 --> 00:24:53.646
distribution provisioning
profile.

381
00:24:54.126 --> 00:24:59.276
And then save the file.

382
00:24:59.836 --> 00:25:03.196
If you're using MDM to
distribute your apps

383
00:24:59.836 --> 00:25:03.196
If you're using MDM to
distribute your apps

384
00:25:03.376 --> 00:25:07.046
and you should you
get the opportunity

385
00:25:07.186 --> 00:25:10.256
to create the manifest file
that can then be provided

386
00:25:10.256 --> 00:25:11.766
to your MDM server over here.

387
00:25:12.356 --> 00:25:18.646
Consult your MDM server and you
can enter the URL and app icons

388
00:25:18.736 --> 00:25:24.256
that will be used to download
the enterprise app that's how

389
00:25:24.256 --> 00:25:26.416
you package your apps
for distribution.

390
00:25:26.836 --> 00:25:32.256
All right so next topic is
something that's near and dear

391
00:25:32.256 --> 00:25:34.876
to all our hearts, code signing

392
00:25:34.876 --> 00:25:37.936
and provisioning
rules, all right.

393
00:25:38.926 --> 00:25:44.976
Code signing certificates
are valid for three years.

394
00:25:45.516 --> 00:25:47.966
[ Applause ]

395
00:25:48.466 --> 00:25:48.976
Thank you.

396
00:25:51.836 --> 00:25:57.996
You can have up to two valid
certificates at a time all right

397
00:25:58.256 --> 00:26:02.606
so they can overlap but at any
particular time you can only

398
00:25:58.256 --> 00:26:02.606
so they can overlap but at any
particular time you can only

399
00:26:02.606 --> 00:26:03.806
have two valid ones.

400
00:26:04.656 --> 00:26:06.986
You have to update
your app binary

401
00:26:06.986 --> 00:26:10.856
to update your code
signing certificate

402
00:26:10.896 --> 00:26:14.036
because you know it's
part of the code bundle.

403
00:26:15.896 --> 00:26:20.116
Provisioning profiles,
provisioning profiles are valid

404
00:26:20.116 --> 00:26:25.686
for one year but you can
renew it at any time.

405
00:26:25.886 --> 00:26:28.706
There is no need to
update your app binary,

406
00:26:29.866 --> 00:26:32.526
in fact it is the best practice

407
00:26:32.726 --> 00:26:36.076
to update your provisioning
profile silently over MDM

408
00:26:36.446 --> 00:26:37.896
so that the apps will
continue running.

409
00:26:39.436 --> 00:26:42.196
Enterprise apps need
both of these to run,

410
00:26:42.646 --> 00:26:44.786
they need to have a valid
code signing certificate

411
00:26:45.726 --> 00:26:50.676
and a valid provisioning
profile at the same time to run

412
00:26:50.676 --> 00:26:57.206
on a user's device so to
illustrate the kind of strategy

413
00:26:57.206 --> 00:26:59.356
that you might have to
build around these rules,

414
00:27:00.066 --> 00:27:05.806
I've got a little chart here
for you, so the vertical bars

415
00:27:05.806 --> 00:27:09.416
in this chart are years, so
this is year 0, year 1, year 2,

416
00:27:09.416 --> 00:27:13.476
year 3, etcetera and the arrow
up there is where you are

417
00:27:13.476 --> 00:27:16.726
in time, I'm going to describe
to you the kinds of things

418
00:27:16.726 --> 00:27:18.006
that you might have to consider

419
00:27:18.536 --> 00:27:20.536
as your app is deployed
over the years.

420
00:27:21.066 --> 00:27:23.586
So let's start by assuming
you're going to publish an app

421
00:27:23.876 --> 00:27:26.256
and year 0, you've never
done it before, here we go,

422
00:27:26.256 --> 00:27:29.946
app A 1.0 at year 0 we're
going to distribute it.

423
00:27:31.106 --> 00:27:33.066
Well the first thing
you got to do is you got

424
00:27:33.066 --> 00:27:36.656
to get yourself a code signing
certificate, so you do that

425
00:27:37.266 --> 00:27:40.346
and you sign your
app with it, great.

426
00:27:40.726 --> 00:27:44.466
Well, that's not enough right,
you need a provisioning profile,

427
00:27:44.466 --> 00:27:46.236
you need a distribution
provisioning profile,

428
00:27:46.236 --> 00:27:49.836
that's so these three steps are
what we have just seen a few

429
00:27:49.836 --> 00:27:52.906
slides ago when you go
through and go to your archives

430
00:27:53.166 --> 00:27:54.716
and distribute for
enterprise, this is it.

431
00:27:54.966 --> 00:27:57.616
You go to cosigning certificate,
you use it to sign an app

432
00:27:58.396 --> 00:28:00.036
and then you have a
provisioning profile.

433
00:27:58.396 --> 00:28:00.036
and then you have a
provisioning profile.

434
00:28:00.766 --> 00:28:03.566
So the provisioning profiles
are embedded in the app

435
00:28:03.566 --> 00:28:06.656
so when the user downloads
the app they automatically get

436
00:28:06.736 --> 00:28:08.346
whatever provisioning
profile you chose

437
00:28:08.346 --> 00:28:11.596
when you distributed that app.

438
00:28:11.736 --> 00:28:14.476
So everything is great,
apps running, fantastic,

439
00:28:14.936 --> 00:28:20.016
six months go by you go hey
there's only six months left

440
00:28:20.016 --> 00:28:24.126
in my provisioning profile, I'd
better refresh this before some

441
00:28:24.296 --> 00:28:27.476
of my users run out of
provisioning profile validity,

442
00:28:28.536 --> 00:28:30.856
so you create a new
provisioning profile,

443
00:28:31.556 --> 00:28:34.556
remember provisioning profiles
can be renewed at any time

444
00:28:34.556 --> 00:28:37.586
so you just do it and
push it out using MDM

445
00:28:37.586 --> 00:28:39.916
and the users are good
to go for another year

446
00:28:39.916 --> 00:28:44.006
from that point, all right.

447
00:28:45.276 --> 00:28:49.116
So everything is going
fine and now you want

448
00:28:49.116 --> 00:28:53.166
to create another app A
version, let's do an app A 2.0,

449
00:28:53.166 --> 00:28:55.986
you do the same thing again
just assign it a code signing

450
00:28:55.986 --> 00:28:58.246
certificate, you don't have

451
00:28:58.246 --> 00:29:01.246
to include another provisioning
profile in app A 2.0

452
00:28:58.246 --> 00:29:01.246
to include another provisioning
profile in app A 2.0

453
00:29:01.526 --> 00:29:04.516
because the apps
bundle ID didn't change

454
00:29:05.256 --> 00:29:08.326
but it's a good idea because
provisioning profiles are free

455
00:29:08.326 --> 00:29:12.766
to renew just make another one,
bundle it in with app A 2.0

456
00:29:13.036 --> 00:29:14.306
so when the user downloads it

457
00:29:14.306 --> 00:29:16.826
at that time they get a
full year's worth of use

458
00:29:17.206 --> 00:29:18.296
of the provisioning profile.

459
00:29:19.786 --> 00:29:24.956
And time goes on and you keep
doing this over the years

460
00:29:24.956 --> 00:29:27.526
and everything is great, all
the users are getting their

461
00:29:27.526 --> 00:29:30.646
provisional profiles pushed
by MDM, you don't have

462
00:29:30.646 --> 00:29:32.316
to do a thing, the
app continues to run.

463
00:29:33.136 --> 00:29:35.416
All right so now
you're 2 1/2 years

464
00:29:35.416 --> 00:29:37.826
into your first code signing
certificates validity date.

465
00:29:39.136 --> 00:29:43.836
You decide to create
another app, app B 1.0.

466
00:29:44.556 --> 00:29:47.576
You could sign app B with your
current cosigning certificate

467
00:29:48.266 --> 00:29:50.366
but you're going to get six
months of use out of it.

468
00:29:51.426 --> 00:29:55.336
So many of our enterprise
developers will have some kind

469
00:29:55.336 --> 00:29:59.256
of threshold date where
they say if there is less

470
00:29:59.256 --> 00:30:00.576
than this number of days left

471
00:29:59.256 --> 00:30:00.576
than this number of days left

472
00:30:00.576 --> 00:30:02.756
in my original code signing
certificate I'm going

473
00:30:02.756 --> 00:30:03.676
to create a new one.

474
00:30:04.286 --> 00:30:06.796
So we're going to assume
six months is too little,

475
00:30:06.796 --> 00:30:09.126
they're going to create a
new code signing certificate

476
00:30:09.126 --> 00:30:15.356
and sign app B with a new
code signing certificate.

477
00:30:15.806 --> 00:30:17.296
Because you're signing at B

478
00:30:17.296 --> 00:30:19.546
with a new code signing
certificate you're going

479
00:30:19.546 --> 00:30:22.926
to have a new distribution
provisioning profile for app B

480
00:30:23.306 --> 00:30:25.936
which you include and everything
is great, everything works,

481
00:30:26.386 --> 00:30:29.916
app A continues to work with
the old cosigning certificate

482
00:30:29.916 --> 00:30:33.386
and app B continues to work with
the new cosigning certificate,

483
00:30:33.906 --> 00:30:40.156
everything is fine until
you reach close the end

484
00:30:40.616 --> 00:30:44.136
of app A's code signing
certificate validity date.

485
00:30:44.796 --> 00:30:45.506
What do we do now?

486
00:30:46.576 --> 00:30:50.516
Well, you can't reuse the
old code singing certificate

487
00:30:50.946 --> 00:30:53.316
but you have a new code
signing certificate that's good

488
00:30:53.316 --> 00:30:57.166
for another few years
however in order

489
00:30:57.166 --> 00:30:58.906
to update the code
signing certificate

490
00:30:58.906 --> 00:31:03.356
in your app you must distribute
a new version of your app

491
00:30:58.906 --> 00:31:03.356
in your app you must distribute
a new version of your app

492
00:31:04.086 --> 00:31:09.496
that is signed with a new code
signing certificate, okay.

493
00:31:09.496 --> 00:31:14.256
And because the code signing
certificate has changed you also

494
00:31:14.256 --> 00:31:17.766
need a new distribution
provisioning profile for app A,

495
00:31:18.906 --> 00:31:21.366
which you bundle with
app A and you distribute.

496
00:31:22.006 --> 00:31:24.766
Now everything is good for
another 2 1/2 years or so.

497
00:31:25.076 --> 00:31:26.906
Notice your code
signing expiration dates

498
00:31:28.006 --> 00:31:30.826
and use the newest code signing
certificate that you have

499
00:31:30.826 --> 00:31:35.986
on hand, embed a new
provisioning profile every time

500
00:31:36.096 --> 00:31:40.036
you distribute a new app.

501
00:31:40.036 --> 00:31:41.726
Host your in house
app using HTTPS,

502
00:31:41.726 --> 00:31:44.146
this is just a little note

503
00:31:44.296 --> 00:31:46.676
because we've made a
recent change in iOS

504
00:31:46.676 --> 00:31:51.316
that requires HTTPS in order
to download your in house apps.

505
00:31:52.386 --> 00:31:55.196
Then use MDM to distribute
your apps

506
00:31:55.616 --> 00:31:58.466
and to refresh you
provisioning profiles silently.

507
00:31:59.056 --> 00:32:03.646
Remember that an app must
be updated in order in order

508
00:31:59.056 --> 00:32:03.646
Remember that an app must
be updated in order in order

509
00:32:03.646 --> 00:32:05.946
to change its code
signing certificates.

510
00:32:08.076 --> 00:32:11.966
All right so that's a little bit
about app distribution strategy.

511
00:32:12.516 --> 00:32:19.376
All right now let's
talk about custom B2B,

512
00:32:21.296 --> 00:32:26.866
so what's custom B2B custom
B2B are apps that are hosted

513
00:32:27.096 --> 00:32:31.666
in the Apple App Store
but are only visible

514
00:32:31.846 --> 00:32:33.346
to a limited audience.

515
00:32:33.856 --> 00:32:39.196
Because they are hosted in the
App Store they are reviewed

516
00:32:39.196 --> 00:32:44.116
by Apple but when you install
a custom B2B app there's no

517
00:32:44.116 --> 00:32:45.526
provisioning profile required

518
00:32:45.826 --> 00:32:48.396
because they are
considered App Store apps.

519
00:32:52.696 --> 00:32:55.476
To publish a custom
B2B app you have

520
00:32:55.506 --> 00:32:56.976
to be an App Store developer,

521
00:32:57.486 --> 00:32:59.176
not necessarily an
enterprise developer,

522
00:32:59.716 --> 00:33:02.616
you follow the same
steps that you do

523
00:32:59.716 --> 00:33:02.616
you follow the same
steps that you do

524
00:33:03.076 --> 00:33:08.246
for publishing irregular App
Store app, however all you got

525
00:33:08.246 --> 00:33:11.426
to do is check that little box
that says custom B2B and when

526
00:33:11.426 --> 00:33:14.096
that happens you get a
field that allows you

527
00:33:14.336 --> 00:33:20.376
to specify what Apple
ID's can see your app.

528
00:33:20.706 --> 00:33:27.186
These Apple ID's are Apple
ID's for the VPP portal,

529
00:33:27.186 --> 00:33:31.556
the volume purchase
program portal, right here.

530
00:33:32.496 --> 00:33:38.666
When a custom B2B app is
published and an Apple ID is put

531
00:33:38.666 --> 00:33:42.746
in there the purchaser of
that app can see these apps,

532
00:33:43.116 --> 00:33:46.276
list it at the bottom
of their VPP portal

533
00:33:47.316 --> 00:33:50.646
where they can then purchase
licenses and push these apps

534
00:33:50.646 --> 00:33:55.256
out using MDM as though
they were App Store apps.

535
00:33:56.936 --> 00:33:59.676
So why would you use custom B2B?

536
00:34:00.356 --> 00:34:03.346
If you're an enterprise
custom B2B is great

537
00:34:03.776 --> 00:34:07.976
if a custom app that's
made for you contains code

538
00:34:07.976 --> 00:34:12.536
that you don't own, when you
buy an app tailor made for you

539
00:34:12.536 --> 00:34:14.416
from some, from a
separate company

540
00:34:14.516 --> 00:34:17.835
for example you can ask
them to publish the app

541
00:34:17.926 --> 00:34:20.876
as a custom B2B app
which you can then view

542
00:34:20.876 --> 00:34:23.906
and purchase using your own
portal and you will know

543
00:34:23.906 --> 00:34:26.196
for sure that nobody else
gets access to that app.

544
00:34:27.126 --> 00:34:32.176
Okay, they're also great for
subsidiaries so if your company

545
00:34:32.176 --> 00:34:35.886
if your enterprise happens
to be a conglomeration

546
00:34:35.886 --> 00:34:39.436
of subsidiaries many of them
have different VPP programs

547
00:34:39.436 --> 00:34:42.996
with different requirements
creating a custom B2B

548
00:34:43.335 --> 00:34:45.426
distribution maybe easier

549
00:34:45.426 --> 00:34:48.746
than developing an enterprise
app for them, all right.

550
00:34:49.045 --> 00:34:52.446
So a custom B2B app does
not require any code signing

551
00:34:52.446 --> 00:34:54.386
or provisioning profile watching

552
00:34:54.386 --> 00:34:57.206
for code signing
provisioning profile expiration

553
00:34:57.696 --> 00:35:00.636
because they are App Store apps.

554
00:34:57.696 --> 00:35:00.636
because they are App Store apps.

555
00:35:00.706 --> 00:35:04.016
You can create promo codes
for beta testing your apps.

556
00:35:05.356 --> 00:35:08.716
So that's custom B2B.

557
00:35:08.946 --> 00:35:12.856
So today we've covered
several high level topics here,

558
00:35:13.536 --> 00:35:16.776
managing your team and
the roles in the program.

559
00:35:17.356 --> 00:35:22.156
We talked about Xcode server and
how it can become a great hub

560
00:35:22.606 --> 00:35:24.286
for your development team.

561
00:35:25.016 --> 00:35:30.346
We talked about app distribution
strategies and we've talked

562
00:35:30.346 --> 00:35:34.006
about custom B2B and how that
can be used in your enterprise.

563
00:35:34.596 --> 00:35:40.556
Some Key take-a-ways, agents
and admins should be employees,

564
00:35:41.546 --> 00:35:45.126
contractors should
be team members.

565
00:35:45.576 --> 00:35:48.636
Use Xcode server for
continuous integration and QA

566
00:35:49.156 --> 00:35:52.536
and keep an eye out
for the code signing

567
00:35:52.536 --> 00:35:56.326
and certificate expiration
dates and use custom B2B

568
00:35:56.326 --> 00:35:59.466
if you don't own the code.

569
00:36:00.196 --> 00:36:03.866
All right I want to call your
attention to a great portal site

570
00:36:03.866 --> 00:36:06.096
that was just launched,
developer.apple.

571
00:36:06.096 --> 00:36:09.616
com/enterprise made especially
for enterprise developers.

572
00:36:10.136 --> 00:36:14.516
Our evangelist is Paul Danbold

573
00:36:16.036 --> 00:36:18.916
and development forums are
always a great resource for you.

574
00:36:19.926 --> 00:36:21.026
Some related sessions,

575
00:36:22.046 --> 00:36:25.246
this morning we had Managing
Apple Devices please check the

576
00:36:25.246 --> 00:36:25.776
video out.

577
00:36:26.556 --> 00:36:28.416
We had Building Apps
for Enterprise

578
00:36:28.416 --> 00:36:31.906
and Education earlier today,
with that thank you very much.

579
