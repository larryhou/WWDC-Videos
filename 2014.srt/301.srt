1
00:00:12.416 --> 00:00:13.016
>> All right.

2
00:00:13.016 --> 00:00:14.596
Good morning everyone.

3
00:00:14.596 --> 00:00:15.746
Welcome to this morning's
session.

4
00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:17.036
My name is Mark Miller.

5
00:00:17.126 --> 00:00:19.926
I'm an iTunes Engineering
Manager on the store,

6
00:00:20.696 --> 00:00:21.826
and we're going to
be talking about

7
00:00:21.826 --> 00:00:25.776
"Affiliate Tools
for App Developers."

8
00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:30.686
Now, just in case anybody is new
to the program, or unfamiliar

9
00:00:30.686 --> 00:00:33.476
with what it's for, we're going
to go over a quick overview

10
00:00:33.506 --> 00:00:36.036
of how it works,
what its purpose is

11
00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:37.156
and how you can use it.

12
00:00:37.246 --> 00:00:41.236
It's also been a couple years
since we've last presented here,

13
00:00:41.516 --> 00:00:44.066
so we'll talk about
what's new in the program

14
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.406
and what new things
you can do with it.

15
00:00:46.756 --> 00:00:50.256
And finally, there's going
to be a deep dive on tools

16
00:00:50.256 --> 00:00:57.676
and services that you can use
to interact with the program.

17
00:00:58.236 --> 00:01:00.096
So first off, we kind of
need a cast of characters.

18
00:00:58.236 --> 00:01:00.096
So first off, we kind of
need a cast of characters.

19
00:01:00.196 --> 00:01:02.646
Who's involved with
the affiliate program

20
00:01:02.646 --> 00:01:04.306
and how do they interact
with each other?

21
00:01:05.296 --> 00:01:07.906
As you might guess, they
are the customer, yours,

22
00:01:08.036 --> 00:01:12.726
and the iTunes Stores, and they
are talking to you and talking

23
00:01:12.896 --> 00:01:15.216
to the iTunes Store,
but what might not be

24
00:01:15.216 --> 00:01:19.956
so obvious is behind the scenes,
there's an affiliate network.

25
00:01:20.516 --> 00:01:23.186
And the affiliate network
mediates the interaction

26
00:01:23.496 --> 00:01:26.026
between you and the store.

27
00:01:26.126 --> 00:01:29.006
And the affiliate network
is where you go to sign up,

28
00:01:29.476 --> 00:01:35.036
set up payments, manage and
track your campaign performance

29
00:01:35.476 --> 00:01:39.266
and go to check on any
support issues you have.

30
00:01:41.816 --> 00:01:44.126
So what's it for?

31
00:01:44.426 --> 00:01:45.976
The key thing that
you're trying to do

32
00:01:45.976 --> 00:01:51.006
with the affiliate program
is to drive customers

33
00:01:51.386 --> 00:01:53.386
to your apps and other content.

34
00:01:53.716 --> 00:01:55.196
So you might have a game,

35
00:01:55.196 --> 00:01:57.866
and perhaps you've
released a sequel to it.

36
00:01:58.246 --> 00:02:00.726
You want to promote
that app, and you can do

37
00:01:58.246 --> 00:02:00.726
You want to promote
that app, and you can do

38
00:02:00.726 --> 00:02:02.116
that using the affiliate
program.

39
00:02:02.416 --> 00:02:05.376
Similarly, you might
already have a website used

40
00:02:05.376 --> 00:02:08.636
to promote your apps, and
you can affiliate those links

41
00:02:08.886 --> 00:02:10.306
and start getting the benefits

42
00:02:10.306 --> 00:02:11.296
of the affiliate
program that way.

43
00:02:12.166 --> 00:02:16.026
But it doesn't have to be your
own apps that you're promoting.

44
00:02:16.276 --> 00:02:19.416
You can promote other
app developers' apps

45
00:02:19.566 --> 00:02:22.296
and other content, and this is
pretty much all of the content

46
00:02:22.296 --> 00:02:24.386
on the Music Store -
excuse me, on the store.

47
00:02:24.756 --> 00:02:30.026
So that's music, movies,
TV shows, books, podcasts,

48
00:02:30.806 --> 00:02:34.326
anything you can think of
is supported by the program.

49
00:02:35.986 --> 00:02:41.406
And the Use Case here is
- there's pretty much -

50
00:02:41.406 --> 00:02:46.666
there's a wide Use Case for
what you can do with it.

51
00:02:46.926 --> 00:02:50.626
You might have a soundtrack
that's related to your game,

52
00:02:51.246 --> 00:02:52.696
and you can promote that.

53
00:02:52.866 --> 00:02:55.926
Or if you're a productivity
app, and there's a similar app

54
00:02:56.226 --> 00:03:00.396
that works well with it,
you can promote that from

55
00:02:56.226 --> 00:03:00.396
that works well with it,
you can promote that from

56
00:03:00.396 --> 00:03:01.956
within the app or
on your website.

57
00:03:02.416 --> 00:03:07.496
Most of all, you are trying to
connect your users with content

58
00:03:07.496 --> 00:03:10.026
that they're going
to want to download.

59
00:03:10.276 --> 00:03:12.326
They're - you're interrupting
their workflow a little bit

60
00:03:12.416 --> 00:03:14.806
to send them to the store,
so make sure it counts.

61
00:03:15.006 --> 00:03:18.486
Make sure that link is relevant
to what they're interested in

62
00:03:18.866 --> 00:03:23.986
and something that they're
going to want to buy.

63
00:03:24.206 --> 00:03:28.206
Now, the key to the
program is that all

64
00:03:29.156 --> 00:03:31.796
of your links need a
little bit of data on them

65
00:03:32.116 --> 00:03:33.416
to function correctly.

66
00:03:33.656 --> 00:03:35.266
So you add a bit
of affiliate data

67
00:03:35.266 --> 00:03:38.446
to an existing iTunes
Store link, and that's it.

68
00:03:38.446 --> 00:03:39.996
You're ready to go with
the affiliate program.

69
00:03:41.196 --> 00:03:45.066
In return for marketing
and promoting the iTunes

70
00:03:45.066 --> 00:03:46.806
and App Stores, you
earn a commission

71
00:03:46.806 --> 00:03:49.656
on sales generated
from that referral.

72
00:03:51.716 --> 00:03:55.806
For you, you get the benefit
of tracking the effectiveness

73
00:03:55.806 --> 00:03:57.596
of your marketing
with our tools.

74
00:03:58.296 --> 00:04:03.886
And best of all, this works
on both web and in your app,

75
00:03:58.296 --> 00:04:03.886
And best of all, this works
on both web and in your app,

76
00:04:04.296 --> 00:04:07.076
so there's no reason
to limit the usage

77
00:04:07.296 --> 00:04:09.886
of the affiliate
program to the web.

78
00:04:09.886 --> 00:04:10.976
You can also do it
within your app.

79
00:04:17.326 --> 00:04:23.376
Now, under the covers, those
links are going to be clicked on

80
00:04:23.376 --> 00:04:26.506
or tapped on in iOS, and the
data from the URL is going

81
00:04:26.506 --> 00:04:29.606
to be copied into a cookie,
and that cookie lives

82
00:04:29.606 --> 00:04:31.876
for 24 hours on the
user's device.

83
00:04:32.656 --> 00:04:34.236
And it's important
that you realize

84
00:04:34.236 --> 00:04:35.866
that the data is
tracking the cookie

85
00:04:35.866 --> 00:04:37.366
and not somewhere on the server.

86
00:04:37.666 --> 00:04:41.276
This means that if the user
clicks on one of your links

87
00:04:41.636 --> 00:04:44.536
and then moves to
her iPhone or iPad

88
00:04:44.586 --> 00:04:50.296
to continue browsing the
store, that any purchase made

89
00:04:50.296 --> 00:04:52.476
on the device will
not credit to you.

90
00:04:52.866 --> 00:04:59.356
So it's the same device that the
tap happens on and the purchase.

91
00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:03.576
Now, once the purchase
happens, the data is copied

92
00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:03.576
Now, once the purchase
happens, the data is copied

93
00:05:03.576 --> 00:05:07.716
into the database and
the database is synced

94
00:05:07.716 --> 00:05:13.486
to the affiliate network,
and that's how you get paid.

95
00:05:13.676 --> 00:05:15.356
Now the terms are really great.

96
00:05:15.926 --> 00:05:19.086
You earn 7 percent
commission on all sales.

97
00:05:19.756 --> 00:05:22.666
That means that if you link
to, for example, an app,

98
00:05:22.666 --> 00:05:25.786
and the user winds up buying
another app, you get credited.

99
00:05:26.346 --> 00:05:30.306
If the user actually leaves
the App Store and goes

100
00:05:30.306 --> 00:05:33.196
to buy something on the Music
Store, you also get credited.

101
00:05:33.196 --> 00:05:36.776
And it's 7 percent for
all sales within 24 hours.

102
00:05:37.346 --> 00:05:40.606
Now this is kind of important.

103
00:05:40.946 --> 00:05:44.136
It's a case of last one wins.

104
00:05:44.256 --> 00:05:47.876
You are operating in
an ecosystem of a lot

105
00:05:47.876 --> 00:05:51.966
of other developers, and it's
whoever is the most recent

106
00:05:52.226 --> 00:05:54.786
referral gets the
credit for the sale.

107
00:05:55.326 --> 00:05:57.596
So if some - if a
user taps on your link

108
00:05:57.596 --> 00:06:00.486
and then three hours
later taps on another link

109
00:05:57.596 --> 00:06:00.486
and then three hours
later taps on another link

110
00:06:00.736 --> 00:06:04.336
from another affiliate,
that affiliate gets credited

111
00:06:04.496 --> 00:06:06.826
for the next 24 hours'
worth of sales.

112
00:06:07.466 --> 00:06:11.916
Now best of all, this
is a seamless experience

113
00:06:12.046 --> 00:06:13.586
from the point of
view of your users.

114
00:06:13.906 --> 00:06:16.906
An affiliate link
looks and acts just

115
00:06:16.906 --> 00:06:18.336
like a regular iTunes
Store link.

116
00:06:19.336 --> 00:06:21.986
So here, we've got an
example of "Cut the Rope,"

117
00:06:22.366 --> 00:06:25.376
and they're promoting the sequel
to their app, "Cut the Rope 2."

118
00:06:25.376 --> 00:06:29.406
So when the user taps on Get
it Now, an affiliate link,

119
00:06:30.386 --> 00:06:32.986
everything acts just
as you expect.

120
00:06:32.986 --> 00:06:37.476
The store carousels in,
and they can preview, buy,

121
00:06:37.696 --> 00:06:38.846
look at reviews, look

122
00:06:38.846 --> 00:06:40.496
at screenshots and
browse the store.

123
00:06:41.166 --> 00:06:44.966
And again, after they've
clicked this, it's not just apps

124
00:06:44.966 --> 00:06:46.936
that are credited
to that affiliate.

125
00:06:47.246 --> 00:06:49.976
It's music, movies,
TV shows, all of it.

126
00:06:49.976 --> 00:06:56.156
So that's the affiliate
program in a nutshell.

127
00:06:56.516 --> 00:07:00.746
Let's talk about what's happened
in the past couple years.

128
00:06:56.516 --> 00:07:00.746
Let's talk about what's happened
in the past couple years.

129
00:07:00.746 --> 00:07:05.006
Most importantly, we have had
a massive territory expansion.

130
00:07:05.496 --> 00:07:06.626
This was the state of the world,

131
00:07:06.906 --> 00:07:09.566
or at least the affiliate
world in 2012.

132
00:07:10.066 --> 00:07:11.396
We were on three continents,

133
00:07:11.866 --> 00:07:15.186
and we had program
support in 45 countries.

134
00:07:16.386 --> 00:07:23.276
Since then, we have
introduced the affiliate program

135
00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:25.586
to 147 countries.

136
00:07:26.076 --> 00:07:28.246
That's a 3X expansion, and 50

137
00:07:28.246 --> 00:07:30.686
of those countries
happened in 2014 alone.

138
00:07:34.896 --> 00:07:37.296
Now, that's pretty great.

139
00:07:37.296 --> 00:07:42.346
You're promoting your apps
and other content worldwide

140
00:07:43.016 --> 00:07:46.506
with the affiliate
program, but best of all,

141
00:07:48.216 --> 00:07:51.736
you only need one network
to work in the entire world.

142
00:07:52.186 --> 00:07:54.336
If you're familiar with the
program from a couple years ago,

143
00:07:54.636 --> 00:07:58.666
you had to sign up with one
program to work in the Americas,

144
00:07:58.986 --> 00:08:01.756
a second program to work in
Europe, and a third program

145
00:07:58.986 --> 00:08:01.756
a second program to work in
Europe, and a third program

146
00:08:01.756 --> 00:08:04.196
to work in Australia
and New Zealand.

147
00:08:04.346 --> 00:08:08.036
Nowadays, one network
gets you worldwide access

148
00:08:08.096 --> 00:08:09.886
to 147 countries.

149
00:08:10.106 --> 00:08:11.026
This is really huge.

150
00:08:15.776 --> 00:08:20.176
Now that means one sign
up, one payment set up,

151
00:08:20.656 --> 00:08:22.766
all your tax information,
all that sort

152
00:08:22.766 --> 00:08:25.866
of financial transaction stuff
that you need to get started

153
00:08:25.866 --> 00:08:27.706
with the program,
you do that once

154
00:08:28.086 --> 00:08:30.126
and you're working
across the globe.

155
00:08:30.686 --> 00:08:35.686
Even better, we have a
common link structure

156
00:08:35.785 --> 00:08:36.796
for the entire world.

157
00:08:37.566 --> 00:08:41.515
Now this is what a normal,

158
00:08:41.515 --> 00:08:43.546
unaffiliated iTunes
Store link looks like.

159
00:08:43.916 --> 00:08:46.656
You can see that it's
in the U.S. storefront.

160
00:08:46.656 --> 00:08:48.216
It's an app called "iMovie"

161
00:08:48.586 --> 00:08:51.176
and there's the iTunes
Store content ID at the end.

162
00:08:51.286 --> 00:08:55.016
It used to be that if you
wanted to add affiliate data

163
00:08:55.066 --> 00:08:56.966
to this URL, you would
end up with something

164
00:08:56.966 --> 00:08:59.936
like these two options,
and you would have to do it

165
00:08:59.936 --> 00:09:01.526
in a region specific manner.

166
00:08:59.936 --> 00:09:01.526
in a region specific manner.

167
00:09:01.886 --> 00:09:04.436
So the URL on top
was for the Americas.

168
00:09:04.436 --> 00:09:06.466
The URL on the bottom
was for Europe.

169
00:09:07.156 --> 00:09:09.266
These URL's are messy.

170
00:09:09.566 --> 00:09:10.616
They're confusing.

171
00:09:10.936 --> 00:09:12.116
They're even suspicious.

172
00:09:12.566 --> 00:09:16.486
If a user were to
look at the link

173
00:09:16.486 --> 00:09:17.796
that you're calling
an iTunes link

174
00:09:18.076 --> 00:09:21.106
and examine it a little more
closely, they would say, "Oh,

175
00:09:21.106 --> 00:09:23.446
I'm, this is, I'm not sure
what I'm clicking on anymore."

176
00:09:23.446 --> 00:09:24.896
They might be turned
away by that.

177
00:09:26.236 --> 00:09:28.306
So no more of that.

178
00:09:28.516 --> 00:09:32.916
Nowadays, we take an
existing store link

179
00:09:33.276 --> 00:09:34.936
and we add just a
small bit of data

180
00:09:35.106 --> 00:09:37.666
and the host is still the
same: iTunes.apple.com.

181
00:09:38.246 --> 00:09:40.686
So what we're adding here

182
00:09:40.686 --> 00:09:45.906
to the base URL is a small
bit of affiliate data.

183
00:09:46.536 --> 00:09:49.716
The first part of that is
the AT Query parameter.

184
00:09:49.856 --> 00:09:51.416
This stands for affiliate token,

185
00:09:51.696 --> 00:09:54.876
and the value is
essentially your user ID

186
00:09:54.976 --> 00:09:56.156
within the affiliate program.

187
00:09:56.336 --> 00:10:00.796
This is how we identify you,
and this is how you get credited

188
00:09:56.336 --> 00:10:00.796
This is how we identify you,
and this is how you get credited

189
00:10:00.856 --> 00:10:03.366
for purchases made after
a user taps on your link.

190
00:10:03.366 --> 00:10:04.966
So it's very important
to get this one right.

191
00:10:05.046 --> 00:10:10.046
Also, in the affiliate data,
is the CT Query parameter,

192
00:10:10.316 --> 00:10:12.266
and CT stands for
campaign token.

193
00:10:12.876 --> 00:10:15.326
And this is an optional query
parameter so you don't have

194
00:10:15.326 --> 00:10:17.646
to put it on, but
you can do a lot

195
00:10:17.646 --> 00:10:19.356
of really important
things with it.

196
00:10:19.766 --> 00:10:23.066
If you have a campaign that
you want to track separately

197
00:10:23.066 --> 00:10:24.526
from the rest of your
marketing efforts,

198
00:10:24.766 --> 00:10:26.806
you can use this
campaign, and it will show

199
00:10:26.806 --> 00:10:29.016
up differently in our UIs.

200
00:10:30.096 --> 00:10:33.516
So for example, you might have
a campaign for your website.

201
00:10:33.666 --> 00:10:35.896
You might have a campaign,
a separate campaign

202
00:10:35.896 --> 00:10:39.026
for the interior
pages of your website.

203
00:10:39.026 --> 00:10:40.016
You could have campaigns

204
00:10:40.016 --> 00:10:42.056
for each email blast
that you send out.

205
00:10:42.456 --> 00:10:44.276
If you're doing online
advertising

206
00:10:44.276 --> 00:10:45.296
and you're buying keywords,

207
00:10:45.536 --> 00:10:47.436
you can have a campaign
for each of those.

208
00:10:47.826 --> 00:10:51.486
You could have campaigns
for links within your apps.

209
00:10:51.666 --> 00:10:55.546
You can do a lot of analysis
to find out what works

210
00:10:55.546 --> 00:10:57.746
and what doesn't with
your marketing efforts.

211
00:10:59.126 --> 00:11:02.916
Now it's important to note
one thing about these URLs.

212
00:10:59.126 --> 00:11:02.916
Now it's important to note
one thing about these URLs.

213
00:11:03.376 --> 00:11:06.096
I said that there's one
link structure worldwide,

214
00:11:06.636 --> 00:11:11.046
but content is not necessarily
available around the world.

215
00:11:11.606 --> 00:11:13.866
The situation for
apps is pretty easy.

216
00:11:14.116 --> 00:11:16.096
Most apps are available
in every country.

217
00:11:16.416 --> 00:11:19.356
But if you're linking to
music or movies or books,

218
00:11:19.676 --> 00:11:23.326
the rights may not carry over
from one storefront to another,

219
00:11:23.476 --> 00:11:25.416
so you need to, if you're
trying to send your user

220
00:11:25.416 --> 00:11:28.786
to a particular piece of
content, it's best to check

221
00:11:28.786 --> 00:11:31.566
if it's available in their
storefront before you present

222
00:11:31.566 --> 00:11:34.976
them with that link.

223
00:11:35.886 --> 00:11:39.256
Another common mistake that
you make when first interacting

224
00:11:39.256 --> 00:11:42.146
with the program is getting
your query strings wrong.

225
00:11:42.306 --> 00:11:47.766
The URLs are fairly simple,
but there's a few gotcha's

226
00:11:47.766 --> 00:11:48.766
that you need to avoid.

227
00:11:49.566 --> 00:11:52.936
The first thing to make
sure of is to identify

228
00:11:52.936 --> 00:11:55.056
if there's already
query string on the URL.

229
00:11:55.056 --> 00:11:57.046
Now the query string, the start

230
00:11:57.046 --> 00:12:00.076
of the query string is
identified by the question mark,

231
00:11:57.046 --> 00:12:00.076
of the query string is
identified by the question mark,

232
00:12:00.286 --> 00:12:01.556
and if there's no question mark,

233
00:12:01.996 --> 00:12:05.266
and you blindly append your
affiliate data using ampersand,

234
00:12:05.696 --> 00:12:08.206
that URL probably won't
even load for your user.

235
00:12:08.206 --> 00:12:11.056
They're just going to have
an error, so don't do that.

236
00:12:11.056 --> 00:12:13.696
What you want to do is
check for the question mark,

237
00:12:13.976 --> 00:12:17.566
and if it's not present on the
string, add the question mark

238
00:12:17.566 --> 00:12:19.136
and then your affiliate data.

239
00:12:20.026 --> 00:12:22.436
Now the reverse is
also a gotcha,

240
00:12:22.576 --> 00:12:23.886
and this is just as important.

241
00:12:24.696 --> 00:12:27.726
If there's already a
question mark in the URL,

242
00:12:28.246 --> 00:12:29.976
that means that there's
an existing query string.

243
00:12:30.366 --> 00:12:33.296
You need to use the ampersand
as a delimiter instead

244
00:12:33.296 --> 00:12:34.556
of using another question mark.

245
00:12:34.806 --> 00:12:37.776
If you click on - if
a user clicks on a URL

246
00:12:37.776 --> 00:12:39.516
with two question marks
in it, it's not going

247
00:12:39.516 --> 00:12:41.066
to parse correctly
and you're not going

248
00:12:41.066 --> 00:12:44.066
to be credited with
the referral.

249
00:12:44.686 --> 00:12:48.186
So the key thing is look
for the question mark,

250
00:12:48.186 --> 00:12:50.236
and if it's already
there, use ampersand

251
00:12:50.236 --> 00:12:51.976
to attach your affiliate data.

252
00:13:00.126 --> 00:13:02.166
Now I mentioned one network.

253
00:13:02.556 --> 00:13:06.036
One of the key benefits of
having one network worldwide is

254
00:13:06.036 --> 00:13:09.236
that you can have a
global unified view

255
00:13:09.676 --> 00:13:12.016
of how your marketing is going.

256
00:13:12.796 --> 00:13:15.006
Now this is a dashboard
that shows you

257
00:13:15.276 --> 00:13:18.286
in real time who's
clicking and what,

258
00:13:18.676 --> 00:13:21.086
what links they're clicking on
- excuse me, not who's clicking

259
00:13:21.086 --> 00:13:23.216
but the type of links
that they're clicking on.

260
00:13:24.426 --> 00:13:27.416
So the first thing you'll
notice about this UI is

261
00:13:27.416 --> 00:13:31.536
that you can track clicks
over time and you can zoom

262
00:13:31.536 --> 00:13:35.846
in from a year's worth of data
all the way down to a day.

263
00:13:35.846 --> 00:13:40.256
And again, these graphs are
updating in near real time.

264
00:13:40.506 --> 00:13:44.346
So in this case, we're looking
at the month-over-month view,

265
00:13:44.806 --> 00:13:47.156
and our current month
is plotted in orange

266
00:13:47.466 --> 00:13:49.776
against the previous
months' performance.

267
00:13:50.346 --> 00:13:52.626
So you can see if your
graph is trending down

268
00:13:53.086 --> 00:13:57.226
or if it's different
compared month over month,

269
00:13:57.486 --> 00:13:59.926
and adjust your marketing
campaign accordingly.

270
00:14:01.466 --> 00:14:04.846
Also of note is that the
conversion rate is mentioned

271
00:14:04.846 --> 00:14:09.426
here, and you should pay
close attention to this value.

272
00:14:09.856 --> 00:14:12.266
If the conversion
rate starts diving,

273
00:14:12.496 --> 00:14:16.256
that might represent a problem
with your marketing efforts.

274
00:14:17.036 --> 00:14:22.196
Maybe your URLs are not really
exciting users into buying,

275
00:14:22.526 --> 00:14:24.276
or maybe there's a
problem with your links

276
00:14:24.536 --> 00:14:26.226
and something needs
investigating.

277
00:14:26.526 --> 00:14:27.766
So keep an eye on that one.

278
00:14:28.066 --> 00:14:32.966
Also on the global
dashboard, you can zoom in

279
00:14:32.966 --> 00:14:34.826
and get a per country
view of things.

280
00:14:35.406 --> 00:14:41.176
The - if you're operating
in more than one country,

281
00:14:41.456 --> 00:14:44.776
you can see how well you're
doing in the U.S. as opposed

282
00:14:44.776 --> 00:14:48.006
to the UK, or in South
America or wherever.

283
00:14:48.836 --> 00:14:53.416
Also, if you are promoting
more than one type of content -

284
00:14:53.876 --> 00:14:57.016
so for example, apps and
books or movies and music -

285
00:14:57.376 --> 00:15:00.996
you can slice and dice and
get reports on how each one

286
00:14:57.376 --> 00:15:00.996
you can slice and dice and
get reports on how each one

287
00:15:00.996 --> 00:15:01.856
of those is performing.

288
00:15:02.886 --> 00:15:04.806
So there's a lot
of rich data here.

289
00:15:05.916 --> 00:15:09.606
And furthermore, there's
more utility up at the top.

290
00:15:10.066 --> 00:15:14.006
You can see additional tools for
interacting with the program.

291
00:15:14.406 --> 00:15:17.446
You can get more in-depth
reports of what's going on.

292
00:15:17.816 --> 00:15:21.356
You can manage your
payments and other settings.

293
00:15:21.616 --> 00:15:24.086
So make sure to check out all
the options that this provides

294
00:15:24.086 --> 00:15:27.226
because it's a great way to
actually see how you're doing

295
00:15:27.226 --> 00:15:28.186
with your marketing efforts.

296
00:15:28.186 --> 00:15:32.876
So that's the Global Dashboard.

297
00:15:32.996 --> 00:15:35.556
It's a single, unified view

298
00:15:36.216 --> 00:15:40.106
of a single network that's
operating in 147 countries.

299
00:15:40.276 --> 00:15:42.206
I can't tell you how
excited I am about the fact

300
00:15:42.206 --> 00:15:44.796
that we have one network that
lets you operate worldwide.

301
00:15:45.036 --> 00:15:48.556
It's a huge simplification
of what we used to have

302
00:15:48.556 --> 00:15:50.216
to do, so very exciting.

303
00:15:50.636 --> 00:15:55.076
Hopefully, at this point
you are similarly excited.

304
00:15:55.076 --> 00:15:56.506
You want to - you're
ready to go.

305
00:15:56.696 --> 00:16:00.016
Go sign up with your program,
and you want to know how next

306
00:15:56.696 --> 00:16:00.016
Go sign up with your program,
and you want to know how next

307
00:16:00.016 --> 00:16:03.976
to - what the next steps
are in terms of integrating.

308
00:16:04.776 --> 00:16:08.516
So for that, we've got a
Tools and Services section.

309
00:16:08.576 --> 00:16:12.656
We're going to start
talking about simple tools

310
00:16:12.656 --> 00:16:13.766
to get you started quickly.

311
00:16:13.766 --> 00:16:17.056
These are things that you don't
need a computer science degree

312
00:16:17.376 --> 00:16:18.196
to work with.

313
00:16:18.916 --> 00:16:21.846
It's maybe just a matter
of creating a couple links

314
00:16:21.846 --> 00:16:23.936
and adding them to an
email or to your website

315
00:16:24.076 --> 00:16:25.666
or somewhere in your app.

316
00:16:25.666 --> 00:16:28.406
These tools are really
great for the one-offs,

317
00:16:28.616 --> 00:16:29.806
the manual sort of set up.

318
00:16:29.806 --> 00:16:32.566
There's also more
advanced tools.

319
00:16:32.566 --> 00:16:38.236
So if you want to find what's
going on really in the now

320
00:16:38.876 --> 00:16:41.406
on the store, and promote
that sort of content,

321
00:16:41.616 --> 00:16:42.706
these tools will
let you do that.

322
00:16:43.996 --> 00:16:45.816
We also provide Smart
App Banners.

323
00:16:45.976 --> 00:16:49.416
Smart App Banners allow
you to promote your app

324
00:16:49.546 --> 00:16:52.936
from your websites in
a very seamless way.

325
00:16:53.056 --> 00:16:56.006
There's a lot of power there,
and in the right situation,

326
00:16:56.156 --> 00:16:57.506
can be very, very useful.

327
00:16:58.596 --> 00:17:00.366
The StoreKit Product Sheet

328
00:16:58.596 --> 00:17:00.366
The StoreKit Product Sheet

329
00:17:00.816 --> 00:17:03.666
and iTunes Radio have been
recently added to the program,

330
00:17:03.666 --> 00:17:06.276
and we'll talk about how
to work with those and how

331
00:17:06.276 --> 00:17:07.955
to get the most out of that.

332
00:17:08.165 --> 00:17:11.866
And finally, we'll finish
with the Collection feature

333
00:17:12.286 --> 00:17:16.715
that allows you to define
dynamic playlists for the store.

334
00:17:17.376 --> 00:17:18.556
This can be really useful

335
00:17:18.965 --> 00:17:22.086
for customizing content
for your users.

336
00:17:22.526 --> 00:17:26.586
Let's get started
with the simple stuff.

337
00:17:27.175 --> 00:17:29.496
The simplest of all
is Link Maker.

338
00:17:30.206 --> 00:17:35.346
This is a simple search
box where you can come in

339
00:17:35.346 --> 00:17:40.176
and type a search term,
get results and get links.

340
00:17:40.866 --> 00:17:43.196
Especially if you
click into Link Maker

341
00:17:43.196 --> 00:17:47.506
from within the affiliate
network, your URL that you come

342
00:17:47.506 --> 00:17:49.296
in with is going to have
all your affiliate data

343
00:17:49.296 --> 00:17:51.336
pre-populated so you
don't need to worry

344
00:17:51.336 --> 00:17:54.266
about adding the affiliate
data to the URL itself.

345
00:17:54.596 --> 00:17:57.136
You don't need to worry
about question marks

346
00:17:57.136 --> 00:17:58.686
and ampersands and
URL encodings.

347
00:17:58.826 --> 00:18:00.716
It's all dramatically easier.

348
00:17:58.826 --> 00:18:00.716
It's all dramatically easier.

349
00:18:01.596 --> 00:18:04.986
So in this case, we're going
to do a search for Ed Sheeran.

350
00:18:05.226 --> 00:18:09.456
He's a UK singer/songwriter with
a lot of awesome great songs,

351
00:18:09.606 --> 00:18:13.746
and we can see that his
albums are available

352
00:18:14.216 --> 00:18:18.086
in the research results,
and by tapping on one

353
00:18:18.086 --> 00:18:23.416
of these search results, we
get a nice pop up of HTML

354
00:18:23.416 --> 00:18:25.976
that we can drop
right into a web page.

355
00:18:26.616 --> 00:18:29.956
Not only that, this
HTML has a number

356
00:18:29.956 --> 00:18:31.436
of different options
for the formatting.

357
00:18:31.686 --> 00:18:34.296
So this is the small
format for the Badge.

358
00:18:34.796 --> 00:18:38.626
If you prefer a large Badge,
we've got HTML to do that.

359
00:18:39.496 --> 00:18:42.256
Similarly, if you just want
to have a raw text link,

360
00:18:42.626 --> 00:18:46.036
maybe this is for an HTML email
blast or something like that,

361
00:18:46.326 --> 00:18:50.426
you've got the raw text
available, as well.

362
00:18:50.426 --> 00:18:52.766
So that's Link Maker
in a nutshell.

363
00:18:52.766 --> 00:18:54.296
It's simple.

364
00:18:54.296 --> 00:18:55.726
It's all UI oriented.

365
00:18:55.726 --> 00:18:58.676
It's a bit of HTML
that you can drop in.

366
00:18:58.676 --> 00:19:00.946
It's a great way if you haven't
started and you only want -

367
00:18:58.676 --> 00:19:00.946
It's a great way if you haven't
started and you only want -

368
00:19:00.946 --> 00:19:04.076
interested in linking to a few
pieces of content, to find that.

369
00:19:05.456 --> 00:19:09.286
But maybe you've already got
a website up and running,

370
00:19:09.676 --> 00:19:12.276
and you've got a
couple hundred links

371
00:19:12.336 --> 00:19:13.996
to various pieces
of iTunes content.

372
00:19:14.636 --> 00:19:18.746
In that case, you might be
interested in Auto Link Maker.

373
00:19:19.816 --> 00:19:25.926
Auto Link Maker is a way to on
the fly, attach affiliate data

374
00:19:25.926 --> 00:19:28.506
to existing iTunes
links within a webpage.

375
00:19:28.726 --> 00:19:31.796
It's a small bit of JavaScripts
that you paste into your page,

376
00:19:32.256 --> 00:19:36.196
and on load, it actually
finds all of the links

377
00:19:36.196 --> 00:19:38.916
to the iTunes Store, and
when they're clicked,

378
00:19:39.666 --> 00:19:43.526
the Event Handler attaches
affiliate data to the URL,

379
00:19:43.846 --> 00:19:45.426
and you get credit for the links

380
00:19:45.426 --> 00:19:47.546
that you're already
sending to the page.

381
00:19:47.856 --> 00:19:51.106
So if you don't want to go in
and edit hundreds or thousands

382
00:19:51.106 --> 00:19:55.146
of pages in your content
website to, you know,

383
00:19:55.146 --> 00:19:56.656
annotate all these links
with affiliate data,

384
00:19:56.936 --> 00:19:57.976
Auto Link Maker can
really help you out there.

385
00:19:58.096 --> 00:20:06.306
So that's the simple
stuff that you can do.

386
00:19:58.096 --> 00:20:06.306
So that's the simple
stuff that you can do.

387
00:20:06.596 --> 00:20:09.006
You might be more interested
in the advanced stuff

388
00:20:09.266 --> 00:20:12.056
for finding content,
and for that,

389
00:20:12.216 --> 00:20:15.626
one of the best tools are
the Search and Lookup APIs.

390
00:20:15.626 --> 00:20:22.556
And this provides metadata
access on the web, up to date,

391
00:20:22.976 --> 00:20:28.136
and very, very easy to do so.

392
00:20:30.196 --> 00:20:31.746
There are two main actions.

393
00:20:32.376 --> 00:20:33.866
The first is Search.

394
00:20:33.866 --> 00:20:35.566
This is probably
like you expect.

395
00:20:35.566 --> 00:20:37.376
You can find content by name.

396
00:20:37.716 --> 00:20:39.566
If you know the artist
name or the song name,

397
00:20:39.566 --> 00:20:41.186
or your user wants
to type something in

398
00:20:41.186 --> 00:20:42.876
and find specific
pieces of content,

399
00:20:43.246 --> 00:20:44.456
you can do that with
the Search API.

400
00:20:45.226 --> 00:20:50.636
The Lookup API allows you
to cross-reference your IDs

401
00:20:50.636 --> 00:20:52.156
with the iTunes Store.

402
00:20:52.496 --> 00:20:54.086
So you might have
a set of content

403
00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:55.016
that you're interested in,

404
00:20:55.016 --> 00:20:56.866
and you know the iTunes
Store content IDs,

405
00:20:56.866 --> 00:20:58.746
you can get the latest data

406
00:20:58.746 --> 00:21:01.916
about that content
using the Lookup API.

407
00:20:58.746 --> 00:21:01.916
about that content
using the Lookup API.

408
00:21:02.206 --> 00:21:05.006
And all these responses
are in the JSON format.

409
00:21:05.106 --> 00:21:06.876
That's JavaScript
object notation.

410
00:21:07.136 --> 00:21:09.396
It's pretty much
the lingua franca

411
00:21:09.396 --> 00:21:11.776
for data transfer on the web.

412
00:21:11.846 --> 00:21:15.386
So let's take a look
at the search API.

413
00:21:16.456 --> 00:21:18.866
The only thing that's
required to get started

414
00:21:18.866 --> 00:21:21.376
with the search API is
the term Query Parameter,

415
00:21:21.576 --> 00:21:23.046
and this of course,
is the search term

416
00:21:23.046 --> 00:21:23.946
that you're interested in.

417
00:21:24.476 --> 00:21:27.726
But there's a lot of
modifiers available,

418
00:21:27.726 --> 00:21:29.206
and you could do some
really interesting stuff

419
00:21:29.456 --> 00:21:32.876
to find specific
pieces of content.

420
00:21:33.096 --> 00:21:35.776
You can also change the nature
of the content that comes back.

421
00:21:35.996 --> 00:21:39.056
So the Language Query
Parameter allows you

422
00:21:39.256 --> 00:21:43.396
to specify the localization
of the response.

423
00:21:43.766 --> 00:21:46.726
So let's say you're searching in
Canada for a piece of content,

424
00:21:47.006 --> 00:21:48.996
but you know you want to
localize it to French.

425
00:21:49.216 --> 00:21:51.016
You can pass in Language
equals FR

426
00:21:51.016 --> 00:21:54.596
and get a result back in French.

427
00:21:54.716 --> 00:21:57.716
Media is a constraint
for the search itself.

428
00:21:58.116 --> 00:22:01.026
If you only are interested
in movies or only interested

429
00:21:58.116 --> 00:22:01.026
If you only are interested
in movies or only interested

430
00:22:01.026 --> 00:22:03.946
in books, you can specify
Media equals Movies

431
00:22:03.946 --> 00:22:06.466
or Media equals Books and
get content back that way.

432
00:22:06.466 --> 00:22:11.586
But what if you're actually
just interested not just in say,

433
00:22:11.896 --> 00:22:14.506
music, but you're
interested in songs,

434
00:22:14.506 --> 00:22:16.556
or you're interested
specifically in albums.

435
00:22:16.896 --> 00:22:18.776
You can use the Entity
Query Parameter

436
00:22:18.776 --> 00:22:22.626
to specify a very
specific piece of content

437
00:22:22.626 --> 00:22:27.676
or collection of
content that way.

438
00:22:28.406 --> 00:22:31.046
Attribute is another
query parameter

439
00:22:31.046 --> 00:22:34.436
that focuses the search
term on a specific case.

440
00:22:35.096 --> 00:22:38.866
So the search will only be
applied to a specific portion

441
00:22:38.936 --> 00:22:42.246
of the content, and this would
allow you to, for example,

442
00:22:42.516 --> 00:22:46.176
if your query is for
Madonna, you might be looking

443
00:22:46.176 --> 00:22:48.126
for the musician Madonna,

444
00:22:48.486 --> 00:22:50.976
and you could use Attribute
equals Artist's name

445
00:22:51.356 --> 00:22:52.596
and the searches would only be

446
00:22:52.596 --> 00:22:54.826
for artists whose
name contains Madonna.

447
00:22:55.526 --> 00:22:56.666
On the other hand,
maybe you're looking

448
00:22:56.666 --> 00:22:58.976
for the Beatles' popular
song "Lady Madonna."

449
00:22:59.456 --> 00:23:01.906
You can specify Attribute
equals Song term

450
00:22:59.456 --> 00:23:01.906
You can specify Attribute
equals Song term

451
00:23:02.446 --> 00:23:05.026
and get song results back.

452
00:23:06.616 --> 00:23:10.656
The Limit Query Parameter is
another one where it can come

453
00:23:10.856 --> 00:23:13.216
in handy in many situations.

454
00:23:13.496 --> 00:23:15.906
By default, you're going
to get 50 results back

455
00:23:16.586 --> 00:23:21.046
for a given query, but
if you only want five,

456
00:23:21.306 --> 00:23:23.866
there's no reason to spend time
parsing the results and waiting

457
00:23:23.866 --> 00:23:25.956
for the response for
a larger data set.

458
00:23:25.956 --> 00:23:29.076
So you can either decrease
or increase the size

459
00:23:29.076 --> 00:23:30.266
of the response set you get.

460
00:23:31.016 --> 00:23:32.726
And finally, there's Callback.

461
00:23:33.226 --> 00:23:38.376
Callback is very useful for web
developers if you are trying

462
00:23:38.376 --> 00:23:42.306
to do something that operates
within the Java excuse me,

463
00:23:42.306 --> 00:23:43.746
the browser security model.

464
00:23:44.066 --> 00:23:46.136
So if you're running
JavaScript in a browser,

465
00:23:46.366 --> 00:23:50.206
you may not have access to make
a call to iTunes.apple.com.

466
00:23:50.666 --> 00:23:52.636
But you can use the
Callback Query parameter

467
00:23:52.886 --> 00:23:59.256
to essentially call a function
with the result of the query.

468
00:23:59.326 --> 00:24:01.736
This can be very useful,

469
00:23:59.326 --> 00:24:01.736
This can be very useful,

470
00:24:01.736 --> 00:24:04.786
and just about every
JavaScript library like J Query,

471
00:24:04.786 --> 00:24:06.966
what have you, supports
Callback.

472
00:24:08.236 --> 00:24:11.296
And all these responses,
once when you do a query,

473
00:24:11.796 --> 00:24:16.626
all the results are in the JSON
format, and they're dictionaries

474
00:24:16.626 --> 00:24:18.926
of content sorted by relevancy.

475
00:24:19.606 --> 00:24:21.226
And relevancy is an
important concept.

476
00:24:21.226 --> 00:24:24.866
It's not - it's our best guess

477
00:24:24.866 --> 00:24:27.246
at what you're actually
searching for.

478
00:24:27.526 --> 00:24:30.126
So it depends on how
appropriate is the content

479
00:24:30.176 --> 00:24:31.166
to the search term.

480
00:24:31.296 --> 00:24:33.546
And it also depends on other
factors like popularity.

481
00:24:33.946 --> 00:24:37.766
So that can be - so your
search queries are not

482
00:24:37.766 --> 00:24:38.906
necessarily static.

483
00:24:38.906 --> 00:24:40.216
They're not going
to be set in time.

484
00:24:40.526 --> 00:24:42.556
If another piece of content
becomes more popular,

485
00:24:42.886 --> 00:24:45.586
it might move from rank number
three to rank number one,

486
00:24:45.586 --> 00:24:47.686
and your search results will
change even though the query

487
00:24:47.686 --> 00:24:48.476
parameter is the same.

488
00:24:52.536 --> 00:24:57.006
Now the Lookup API uses a lot
of similar query parameters

489
00:24:57.006 --> 00:25:00.246
to the Search API, but the
only thing required is an ID,

490
00:24:57.006 --> 00:25:00.246
to the Search API, but the
only thing required is an ID,

491
00:25:00.656 --> 00:25:04.506
and the ID can be an
iTunes Store content ID,

492
00:25:04.726 --> 00:25:08.296
or it can be a list, comma
separated, of those same IDs.

493
00:25:08.936 --> 00:25:13.106
The Lookup API also supports
other identifier standards.

494
00:25:13.456 --> 00:25:19.676
So if you have UPCs for albums,
or ISBNs for books, or ISRCs,

495
00:25:19.676 --> 00:25:24.786
or any number of other
standard ID schemes,

496
00:25:25.006 --> 00:25:26.376
you can pass those in as well.

497
00:25:32.796 --> 00:25:35.746
So we support similar
modifiers to the search API.

498
00:25:35.816 --> 00:25:37.636
Language is a - as
you would expect,

499
00:25:38.016 --> 00:25:39.736
Callback is as you would expect.

500
00:25:39.736 --> 00:25:42.226
The results are the exact
same content dictionaries,

501
00:25:42.226 --> 00:25:45.026
and you can pass them into
some function you define

502
00:25:45.026 --> 00:25:45.646
in JavaScript.

503
00:25:47.496 --> 00:25:51.386
Entity is slightly
different in the Lookup API.

504
00:25:51.386 --> 00:25:54.386
So you're passing in
one or more content IDs,

505
00:25:54.386 --> 00:25:58.046
and you can use the Entity
ID to actually navigate up

506
00:25:58.046 --> 00:26:00.116
or down the content tree.

507
00:25:58.046 --> 00:26:00.116
or down the content tree.

508
00:26:00.636 --> 00:26:04.516
We'll go into how you
can use this in a bit.

509
00:26:04.516 --> 00:26:06.756
And again, the results
are JSON dictionaries,

510
00:26:07.056 --> 00:26:09.846
so it's the exact same content
whether you're using Search API

511
00:26:09.846 --> 00:26:11.056
or Lookup API.

512
00:26:11.906 --> 00:26:16.996
And the responses you get back
are very, very rich in data.

513
00:26:17.716 --> 00:26:20.656
Now I know this is a wall
of text, but there's a lot

514
00:26:20.656 --> 00:26:24.846
of information here that you
can use to populate your UIs

515
00:26:25.306 --> 00:26:28.746
or to populate your
recommendations.

516
00:26:29.096 --> 00:26:30.406
There's the expected.

517
00:26:30.406 --> 00:26:34.076
You can get the artist ID, the
artist name, the album name,

518
00:26:34.076 --> 00:26:35.966
the song name, app
name, what have you.

519
00:26:36.496 --> 00:26:38.476
But there's also
you can get the -

520
00:26:38.476 --> 00:26:40.146
what's the most recent
version on the store?

521
00:26:40.146 --> 00:26:42.016
What are the release
notes for that version?

522
00:26:42.016 --> 00:26:44.146
When was it released?

523
00:26:44.346 --> 00:26:45.136
How much is it?

524
00:26:45.396 --> 00:26:46.776
What's the file size?

525
00:26:46.776 --> 00:26:49.766
Maybe you only want to recommend
small files to your users

526
00:26:49.766 --> 00:26:52.266
on some sort of constrained
device.

527
00:26:53.076 --> 00:26:56.726
You can see screenshots,
album artwork.

528
00:26:56.996 --> 00:27:00.006
What is the user rating for
this particular content?

529
00:26:56.996 --> 00:27:00.006
What is the user rating for
this particular content?

530
00:27:00.256 --> 00:27:02.136
What is the age rating
for the content?

531
00:27:02.396 --> 00:27:07.996
All this can really be useful if
you're trying to populate a UI.

532
00:27:08.236 --> 00:27:10.326
So that said, let's go
through a couple examples.

533
00:27:10.826 --> 00:27:15.976
Let's say we are developing
a music app and we want

534
00:27:16.036 --> 00:27:18.436
to show the user a search API

535
00:27:18.616 --> 00:27:20.646
so that they can find
content on the store.

536
00:27:21.246 --> 00:27:26.046
So we might have a search box
that they can type something in,

537
00:27:26.376 --> 00:27:30.046
and we would put that
content into this sort of URL.

538
00:27:30.316 --> 00:27:31.216
And I want to highlight

539
00:27:31.216 --> 00:27:36.676
that we're specifying the U.S.
Storefront, and we're passing

540
00:27:36.676 --> 00:27:37.936
in the term that
we're trying to search

541
00:27:37.936 --> 00:27:40.716
for in the query parameter term.

542
00:27:40.876 --> 00:27:44.466
In this case, the user
has typed in "The A Team."

543
00:27:44.736 --> 00:27:46.616
Excuse me.

544
00:27:47.206 --> 00:27:54.616
Now this query alone is going
to be - what you're going

545
00:27:54.616 --> 00:27:59.826
to get is basically one of
Ed Sheeran's popular songs

546
00:27:59.996 --> 00:28:02.416
from the past couple years,
which is called "The A Team,"

547
00:27:59.996 --> 00:28:02.416
from the past couple years,
which is called "The A Team,"

548
00:28:02.416 --> 00:28:05.116
and that's going to be very
popular, so that's going to be

549
00:28:05.116 --> 00:28:05.976
at the top of the list.

550
00:28:06.296 --> 00:28:08.636
Following that, you're going
to see something like the

551
00:28:08.636 --> 00:28:12.006
"The A-Team's" movie, which
came out a couple years ago,

552
00:28:12.536 --> 00:28:16.456
and is second behind
the song content.

553
00:28:16.456 --> 00:28:21.206
And following that, you're going
to get about 45 results for the

554
00:28:21.206 --> 00:28:23.496
"The A-Team" TV show
from the '80's.

555
00:28:23.766 --> 00:28:25.236
Now, "The A-Team"
show is awesome.

556
00:28:25.236 --> 00:28:26.146
Who doesn't like
the "The A-Team."

557
00:28:26.146 --> 00:28:26.626
That's great.

558
00:28:27.026 --> 00:28:30.196
But we're a music app so
we might not be interested

559
00:28:30.386 --> 00:28:32.036
in getting TV show results.

560
00:28:32.636 --> 00:28:35.526
Now the simple thing to do

561
00:28:35.526 --> 00:28:37.756
in this case would
just be attach a limit.

562
00:28:37.756 --> 00:28:40.516
We can say, "Oh, well I'm only
interested in the music stuff.

563
00:28:40.516 --> 00:28:42.016
The music stuff is
ranking highly,

564
00:28:42.326 --> 00:28:44.826
so I'll put Limit equals 1 and
I only get one result back."

565
00:28:45.986 --> 00:28:48.796
That's great, but what
if another sequel to the

566
00:28:48.796 --> 00:28:52.246
"The A-Team's" movie comes out
and suddenly that's highest.

567
00:28:52.626 --> 00:28:56.956
Our music app is suddenly
showing content for movies,

568
00:28:57.146 --> 00:29:00.356
and that wouldn't be good.

569
00:28:57.146 --> 00:29:00.356
and that wouldn't be good.

570
00:29:00.356 --> 00:29:01.546
So that's one option.

571
00:29:02.296 --> 00:29:04.936
There's a couple other
things we could do.

572
00:29:04.936 --> 00:29:07.606
We could say well, we're
only interested in searching

573
00:29:08.036 --> 00:29:11.146
for the song term "The A
Team," or we're only interested

574
00:29:11.146 --> 00:29:16.906
in songs that are related to
the search term "The A Team."

575
00:29:17.446 --> 00:29:19.976
But that's not really - that's
going to limit us a little bit,

576
00:29:19.976 --> 00:29:23.236
because what if we want to
show albums, or what if we want

577
00:29:23.236 --> 00:29:27.616
to search on albums that
are called "The A Team."

578
00:29:27.616 --> 00:29:29.246
There's probably
several of those.

579
00:29:30.286 --> 00:29:33.816
So for our use case, this is
probably not such a great idea.

580
00:29:34.596 --> 00:29:40.106
Instead, we need to find the
right thing to specify the type

581
00:29:40.106 --> 00:29:43.666
of content we're interested
in, and here, it's media=music.

582
00:29:43.726 --> 00:29:44.536
We're a music app.

583
00:29:44.786 --> 00:29:47.946
We want people to be able
to search for artists

584
00:29:47.946 --> 00:29:49.726
or albums or songs, whatever.

585
00:29:50.286 --> 00:29:52.286
So we can specify media=music

586
00:29:52.286 --> 00:29:54.166
and we get just the
results we're looking for.

587
00:29:54.576 --> 00:29:58.606
So we run this query and we
get the results we want back,

588
00:29:58.606 --> 00:29:58.976
which is great.

589
00:30:07.046 --> 00:30:12.736
Now, this is just one piece of
results, or one result back.

590
00:30:13.146 --> 00:30:16.346
Let's say our UI, we
might have an album focus,

591
00:30:16.766 --> 00:30:19.586
rather than on a specific song.

592
00:30:19.586 --> 00:30:21.376
And let's say that
our UI we want

593
00:30:21.376 --> 00:30:25.936
to know how much does the
content cost in the storefront.

594
00:30:26.186 --> 00:30:29.346
And furthermore, we want
to show them all the songs

595
00:30:29.736 --> 00:30:31.446
on that album in
that storefront.

596
00:30:33.676 --> 00:30:36.456
Now, I like to say that
if you have a problem,

597
00:30:36.906 --> 00:30:40.556
if no one else can help,
and if your problem relates

598
00:30:40.556 --> 00:30:42.516
to content metadata
on the iTunes Store,

599
00:30:43.096 --> 00:30:46.346
maybe you can hire
the Lookup API.

600
00:30:47.076 --> 00:30:51.126
In this case, we have
figured out that our user is

601
00:30:51.126 --> 00:30:55.466
in Great Britain, and so we
would just change the country

602
00:30:55.726 --> 00:31:00.356
code in the URL to be GB, Great
Britain, and we're passing

603
00:30:55.726 --> 00:31:00.356
code in the URL to be GB, Great
Britain, and we're passing

604
00:31:00.356 --> 00:31:03.656
in the ID of the
collection itself.

605
00:31:03.796 --> 00:31:06.666
Now the Lookup API has
a very simple model

606
00:31:06.916 --> 00:31:08.196
for content on the store.

607
00:31:08.516 --> 00:31:10.896
There are tracks,
which are individual,

608
00:31:11.116 --> 00:31:13.046
indivisible pieces of content.

609
00:31:13.276 --> 00:31:17.786
So this would be songs, books,
movies, TV episodes, apps.

610
00:31:19.186 --> 00:31:22.296
There are collections,
which are albums,

611
00:31:22.486 --> 00:31:24.056
TV seasons, that sort of thing.

612
00:31:24.056 --> 00:31:25.386
And there are artists.

613
00:31:25.946 --> 00:31:30.056
These are musicians, actors, app
developers, that sort of thing.

614
00:31:30.646 --> 00:31:33.496
Three levels, and you
can use the Lookup API

615
00:31:33.606 --> 00:31:35.116
to navigate that hierarchy.

616
00:31:36.136 --> 00:31:41.426
So we're passing in the
collection ID or the album ID

617
00:31:41.836 --> 00:31:45.596
to the Lookup API, and we're
going to get results back to see

618
00:31:45.596 --> 00:31:47.826
if it's available for
sale in Great Britain.

619
00:31:48.846 --> 00:31:52.486
What we're not going to see
is what tracks are available

620
00:31:52.666 --> 00:31:53.646
on that URL.

621
00:31:53.646 --> 00:31:58.716
What we need to do in that
case is attach the entity

622
00:31:58.716 --> 00:32:04.296
that we're looking for, and the
entity=song will tell the Lookup

623
00:31:58.716 --> 00:32:04.296
that we're looking for, and the
entity=song will tell the Lookup

624
00:32:04.296 --> 00:32:07.036
API, okay, give me back the
results that I asked for,

625
00:32:07.286 --> 00:32:11.806
but also give me back the
songs that are on that album.

626
00:32:11.806 --> 00:32:15.716
And here, we get the awesome
results back that you expect.

627
00:32:16.046 --> 00:32:19.676
So we get the album name, which
is "Plus," and the first track

628
00:32:19.676 --> 00:32:23.146
on that album is the "The
A Team" and so on the rest

629
00:32:23.376 --> 00:32:25.306
of the songs on that album.

630
00:32:25.306 --> 00:32:29.576
You can also go - navigate
up the content hierarchy,

631
00:32:29.576 --> 00:32:31.326
so if you've got a song and
you want to know the artist,

632
00:32:31.326 --> 00:32:36.746
you can pass in entity=artist
and track that that way.

633
00:32:36.936 --> 00:32:40.666
So there's a lot you can
do with the Lookup API.

634
00:32:40.666 --> 00:32:42.406
It's all up to date.

635
00:32:42.406 --> 00:32:44.276
You might want to know
about price changes

636
00:32:44.276 --> 00:32:45.226
for particular things.

637
00:32:45.566 --> 00:32:49.336
The Lookup API allows
you to do that.

638
00:32:49.526 --> 00:32:54.386
Now, that said, you might
have slightly bigger needs

639
00:32:54.556 --> 00:32:55.336
in terms of data.

640
00:32:56.266 --> 00:32:59.916
And for that, we have the
Enterprise Partner Feeds,

641
00:33:00.146 --> 00:33:01.846
or EPF as we commonly call them.

642
00:33:02.496 --> 00:33:05.986
These are bulk metadata,

643
00:33:06.076 --> 00:33:09.676
and it covers virtually
all iTunes Store content,

644
00:33:10.006 --> 00:33:15.056
and this is very much for -
intended for big data needs.

645
00:33:15.486 --> 00:33:17.926
And when I say big
data, it's a lot.

646
00:33:17.926 --> 00:33:21.636
It's something like if you
download the full data set

647
00:33:21.636 --> 00:33:24.016
for this week, it's
going to be 10 gigabytes

648
00:33:24.016 --> 00:33:25.606
of textual data compressed.

649
00:33:25.696 --> 00:33:28.916
So it's not for the faint of
heart, but it can be very useful

650
00:33:28.916 --> 00:33:33.226
if you're trying to
establish an understanding

651
00:33:33.226 --> 00:33:34.636
of the entire iTunes universe.

652
00:33:35.086 --> 00:33:39.506
Within the feeds
are multiple files,

653
00:33:39.506 --> 00:33:42.156
and the files represent
database tables

654
00:33:42.156 --> 00:33:43.606
in a relational database sense.

655
00:33:43.956 --> 00:33:45.056
So there is for example,

656
00:33:45.296 --> 00:33:48.536
an artist table representing
artists- you know musicians,

657
00:33:48.536 --> 00:33:49.466
app developers and the like.

658
00:33:49.916 --> 00:33:53.796
There's an application
table for iPhone apps

659
00:33:53.796 --> 00:33:55.476
and Mac apps, that
sort of thing.

660
00:33:55.926 --> 00:33:57.486
And as you might expect
if you are familiar

661
00:33:57.486 --> 00:33:58.956
with relational databases,

662
00:33:59.266 --> 00:34:01.786
there's a relational
artist application table

663
00:33:59.266 --> 00:34:01.786
there's a relational
artist application table

664
00:34:02.186 --> 00:34:05.666
that represents which
artists produced which apps.

665
00:34:05.886 --> 00:34:10.076
So you can ingest this data
into a relational database

666
00:34:10.076 --> 00:34:14.716
or other data store for analysis
and run your queries that way.

667
00:34:15.866 --> 00:34:18.576
And again, it's aimed
at organizations

668
00:34:18.886 --> 00:34:21.295
that have really
deep data needs.

669
00:34:22.346 --> 00:34:23.666
There's a lot of data.

670
00:34:23.666 --> 00:34:26.565
There's pricing for
all countries

671
00:34:26.565 --> 00:34:31.045
that the iTunes Store supports,
and analyzing that and dealing

672
00:34:31.045 --> 00:34:33.286
with the data, especially
on an ongoing basis,

673
00:34:33.286 --> 00:34:36.096
can be really a huge effort.

674
00:34:36.835 --> 00:34:39.136
Fortunately, we do have
an Importer script.

675
00:34:39.815 --> 00:34:45.795
The script is available as a
Python app, and it's intended

676
00:34:46.126 --> 00:34:51.496
to ingest a feed into a
MySQL database, but it's -

677
00:34:51.496 --> 00:34:54.466
the sample code is
open, so if you'd like,

678
00:34:54.466 --> 00:34:57.276
you can provide a different
back end and maybe write

679
00:34:57.276 --> 00:35:02.716
to Hadoop HDFS or something like
that if your needs go that way.

680
00:34:57.276 --> 00:35:02.716
to Hadoop HDFS or something like
that if your needs go that way.

681
00:35:03.906 --> 00:35:06.856
So the Enterprise Partner
feeds - it's a great way

682
00:35:06.856 --> 00:35:11.086
to get the whole content
database for iTunes.

683
00:35:11.086 --> 00:35:16.946
You can do a lot with it,
but it takes some doing.

684
00:35:17.066 --> 00:35:19.496
Slightly simpler
is the RSS feeds.

685
00:35:19.916 --> 00:35:25.346
These are dynamic feeds for
kind of what's hot in a store.

686
00:35:25.416 --> 00:35:28.366
And by that I mean, you've
got a couple options.

687
00:35:28.366 --> 00:35:30.886
You can see what's most
popular for each piece

688
00:35:30.886 --> 00:35:32.656
of content and in each genre.

689
00:35:33.076 --> 00:35:34.746
What's selling really
well right now?

690
00:35:35.776 --> 00:35:36.306
What's new?

691
00:35:36.306 --> 00:35:38.236
What's recently added?

692
00:35:38.236 --> 00:35:40.596
Whether this is, you
know, the hot new single

693
00:35:40.596 --> 00:35:46.416
from today's artists or maybe a
piece of an album that has been

694
00:35:46.416 --> 00:35:50.066
out of the store for decades
and is just arriving now.

695
00:35:50.396 --> 00:35:52.526
That's shows up in the New
and Recently added feeds.

696
00:35:52.596 --> 00:35:56.256
You can see featured content
- what's actually showing

697
00:35:56.256 --> 00:35:59.526
up on the store right
now, what's a user see

698
00:35:59.526 --> 00:36:03.216
when they open iTunes to the
main page and check that out.

699
00:35:59.526 --> 00:36:03.216
when they open iTunes to the
main page and check that out.

700
00:36:03.216 --> 00:36:06.176
And finally, you can
see customer reviews

701
00:36:06.176 --> 00:36:07.476
for a particular
piece of content.

702
00:36:07.476 --> 00:36:08.616
What are people saying about it?

703
00:36:08.616 --> 00:36:12.706
There's - if you want to track
your own apps' performance,

704
00:36:12.706 --> 00:36:16.256
you can see recent customer
reviews using that RSS feed.

705
00:36:16.746 --> 00:36:20.506
RSS is available in Atom format.

706
00:36:20.746 --> 00:36:23.396
That's pretty much the
standard for RSS these days.

707
00:36:23.396 --> 00:36:25.376
It's also available in JSON.

708
00:36:25.376 --> 00:36:26.816
If you don't want to
parse a bunch of XML,

709
00:36:26.816 --> 00:36:30.026
you can get a JSON
format returned to you

710
00:36:30.346 --> 00:36:31.836
and ingest it that way.

711
00:36:33.296 --> 00:36:36.536
So that's the advanced stuff.

712
00:36:37.066 --> 00:36:39.716
There's all this and more
is very well documented

713
00:36:39.716 --> 00:36:42.076
on the website, and
we'll have a URL for you

714
00:36:42.076 --> 00:36:46.086
at the end of the session.

715
00:36:46.216 --> 00:36:53.716
Smart App Banners are a way for
you to cross-reference your app

716
00:36:53.836 --> 00:36:56.546
from a website, and you've
probably seen this browsing the

717
00:36:56.546 --> 00:36:57.706
web with the mobile Safari.

718
00:36:58.026 --> 00:37:01.216
You link to a website, and
this little banner slides down

719
00:36:58.026 --> 00:37:01.216
You link to a website, and
this little banner slides down

720
00:37:01.476 --> 00:37:04.756
and allows you to download the
app if you haven't already,

721
00:37:05.186 --> 00:37:08.986
or open it if you've got
it installed, or dismiss it

722
00:37:08.986 --> 00:37:10.526
if you're actually not
interested in the app.

723
00:37:10.876 --> 00:37:13.936
So from the user's perspective,
it's really powerful.

724
00:37:13.936 --> 00:37:17.506
It's - if you want it, it's
there, and if you don't,

725
00:37:18.156 --> 00:37:21.216
it gets out of the way.

726
00:37:21.436 --> 00:37:25.046
What it does allow you,
the developer, to do,

727
00:37:25.246 --> 00:37:29.236
is to show your content from
your website in a native,

728
00:37:29.436 --> 00:37:31.876
custom experience that
your app can provide

729
00:37:31.876 --> 00:37:33.266
that mobile Safari maybe can't.

730
00:37:34.226 --> 00:37:39.056
So this is really powerful
if you want to show or -

731
00:37:40.616 --> 00:37:42.286
have people look at the content

732
00:37:42.286 --> 00:37:44.826
on your website in
your custom app.

733
00:37:46.186 --> 00:37:49.436
And again, if a user is not
interested, a simple tap

734
00:37:49.436 --> 00:37:51.746
and it goes away, and
they're not bothered by it.

735
00:37:52.176 --> 00:37:53.176
So how do we integrate
with that?

736
00:37:53.616 --> 00:37:55.316
It's actually fairly simple.

737
00:37:55.316 --> 00:37:58.696
You drop a simple metatag into
the head of your web page,

738
00:37:59.156 --> 00:38:02.426
and the metatag has your
app ID defined in it.

739
00:37:59.156 --> 00:38:02.426
and the metatag has your
app ID defined in it.

740
00:38:02.566 --> 00:38:03.446
That's pretty obvious.

741
00:38:03.446 --> 00:38:04.816
We've got to know
how to find it.

742
00:38:05.176 --> 00:38:07.516
And when Mobile Safari
sees that,

743
00:38:07.516 --> 00:38:10.186
it's going to fetch the
content, get the latest price

744
00:38:10.716 --> 00:38:13.896
and show it to the user.

745
00:38:13.896 --> 00:38:15.966
You can also pass in
your affiliate data.

746
00:38:16.456 --> 00:38:19.036
So here we've got our affiliate
token, which defines us

747
00:38:19.036 --> 00:38:22.526
to the affiliate program, and
we're setting the campaign token

748
00:38:22.526 --> 00:38:25.596
as Smart Banner so that we can
see how many people are actually

749
00:38:25.596 --> 00:38:27.456
clicking on the Smart
Banner from our website.

750
00:38:27.806 --> 00:38:33.186
Now the app argument is actually
a really important piece

751
00:38:33.186 --> 00:38:33.796
of data here.

752
00:38:34.646 --> 00:38:36.936
If we are running a news website

753
00:38:36.936 --> 00:38:38.496
or a music recommendation
website,

754
00:38:38.496 --> 00:38:41.106
and we're asking the user
to leave Mobile Safari,

755
00:38:41.106 --> 00:38:45.626
leave all that context and
launch into this custom app,

756
00:38:45.896 --> 00:38:49.186
we don't want to lose - we
don't want them to, you know,

757
00:38:49.186 --> 00:38:51.026
start at the home page
of our site again.

758
00:38:51.376 --> 00:38:53.896
The app argument is
actually provided to the app

759
00:38:54.036 --> 00:38:58.636
on a command line and you
can see the same content

760
00:38:58.986 --> 00:39:01.126
that the user was
looking at on the store.

761
00:38:58.986 --> 00:39:01.126
that the user was
looking at on the store.

762
00:39:01.806 --> 00:39:05.446
So it's a way, you know,
it's easy, easy integration

763
00:39:05.726 --> 00:39:07.666
without really interrupting
the flow of things.

764
00:39:09.056 --> 00:39:10.146
So that's Smart App Banner.

765
00:39:10.146 --> 00:39:14.686
If you've got a large website,
it's a very useful tool

766
00:39:16.066 --> 00:39:20.866
for cross-referencing
your website and your app.

767
00:39:21.436 --> 00:39:26.366
The StoreKit Product Sheet is a
brand new feature that we've got

768
00:39:26.366 --> 00:39:29.126
and for the affiliate program.

769
00:39:29.126 --> 00:39:33.976
It actually exists since
iTunes 6 and allows you

770
00:39:34.346 --> 00:39:38.756
to show iTunes Store content
without actually leaving your -

771
00:39:38.756 --> 00:39:40.506
the workflow that
your user was in.

772
00:39:41.146 --> 00:39:43.156
So for an example, we've
got here on Twitter,

773
00:39:43.856 --> 00:39:47.206
the user sees a link to
the iTunes Store and taps

774
00:39:47.206 --> 00:39:52.916
on this icon, and the
store sheet slides up

775
00:39:53.496 --> 00:39:56.486
and allows the user to do
all the expected things

776
00:39:56.486 --> 00:39:57.696
that you would do in the store.

777
00:39:57.696 --> 00:39:58.956
So you can read reviews.

778
00:39:58.956 --> 00:39:59.976
You can look at screenshots.

779
00:40:01.636 --> 00:40:04.006
You can buy it right
then and there.

780
00:40:04.566 --> 00:40:06.796
Most importantly,
when they're done,

781
00:40:07.516 --> 00:40:10.356
they can dismiss the store
- or the Store Sheet,

782
00:40:11.726 --> 00:40:16.546
and they're right back in the
app on the page that they were

783
00:40:16.546 --> 00:40:19.326
in before, so there's no
double tap to the home screen

784
00:40:19.326 --> 00:40:20.206
and going back to your app.

785
00:40:20.526 --> 00:40:23.396
It's all right in the same flow.

786
00:40:23.996 --> 00:40:27.236
Now the Store Sheet, as I
said, has existed in iTunes 6,

787
00:40:27.536 --> 00:40:31.026
but only recently have we added
it to the commission structure.

788
00:40:31.436 --> 00:40:35.266
So that means if you
add affiliate data

789
00:40:35.456 --> 00:40:38.666
to the Store Sheet, you're going
to get paid that same 7 percent

790
00:40:38.666 --> 00:40:40.896
over 24 hours that
you did before.

791
00:40:44.936 --> 00:40:47.736
And to go over a demo of how
we can use the StoreKit Product

792
00:40:47.736 --> 00:40:50.536
Sheet in our apps, I'm inviting
my friend Rick Rubenstein

793
00:40:50.536 --> 00:40:53.206
up to show us how to use
Xcode and drop it in.

794
00:40:53.466 --> 00:40:54.096
>> Thank you Mark.

795
00:40:54.796 --> 00:40:56.686
So I'm Rick Rubenstein.

796
00:40:56.686 --> 00:41:00.296
I write tools and automation for
the iTunes store and App Store

797
00:40:56.686 --> 00:41:00.296
I write tools and automation for
the iTunes store and App Store

798
00:41:00.296 --> 00:41:01.726
and other related products.

799
00:41:02.376 --> 00:41:04.556
And Mark asked me to
put together a quick app

800
00:41:04.606 --> 00:41:06.746
to show how the StoreKit
product works,

801
00:41:07.106 --> 00:41:08.526
out in the lobby
before the session.

802
00:41:10.786 --> 00:41:12.996
Kidding, I wrote it a
little while before that.

803
00:41:12.996 --> 00:41:15.446
So let me switch
over to iOS here.

804
00:41:17.356 --> 00:41:22.106
So I'm going to fire up the
app that I wrote right now,

805
00:41:22.106 --> 00:41:24.636
and then I'll explain how
it was built afterwards.

806
00:41:27.636 --> 00:41:31.016
So here we have your typical
stick figure doing a juggling

807
00:41:31.016 --> 00:41:31.436
trick app.

808
00:41:31.506 --> 00:41:33.046
I'm sure you all have
several of these loaded

809
00:41:33.046 --> 00:41:34.186
on your own iOS devices.

810
00:41:34.576 --> 00:41:39.126
And if I'm a user, and I'm
mesmerized by this juggler,

811
00:41:39.126 --> 00:41:42.306
I might say to myself, you
know, I would like some sort

812
00:41:42.306 --> 00:41:43.946
of a juggling-related game.

813
00:41:44.576 --> 00:41:47.926
Oh look, there's a button
right here in this very app

814
00:41:47.926 --> 00:41:50.936
that will let me get
that content from,

815
00:41:50.936 --> 00:41:52.236
in this case, the App Store.

816
00:41:53.216 --> 00:41:57.346
So if I tap on that
link, it will bring

817
00:41:57.346 --> 00:42:00.676
up the StoreKit Product
Sheet, just as Mark showed,

818
00:41:57.346 --> 00:42:00.676
up the StoreKit Product
Sheet, just as Mark showed,

819
00:42:00.676 --> 00:42:06.526
and in the case, the StoreKit
Product Sheet is displaying a

820
00:42:07.046 --> 00:42:09.286
juggling-themed ball app.

821
00:42:09.886 --> 00:42:13.236
Now the key thing here is that
while it may look as if I'm

822
00:42:13.236 --> 00:42:16.406
in the App Store right now,

823
00:42:16.876 --> 00:42:20.756
the Juggling dude app is still
running there in the background.

824
00:42:20.756 --> 00:42:24.296
So if I had wanted to
when I brought that up,

825
00:42:24.556 --> 00:42:27.006
I could've actually
decided to buy this app.

826
00:42:27.286 --> 00:42:29.046
I'm not going to do that
right now because I'm cheap,

827
00:42:29.346 --> 00:42:33.096
but if I were an actual
customer, I might do that.

828
00:42:33.566 --> 00:42:35.106
And then you, the affiliate,

829
00:42:35.406 --> 00:42:37.196
would receive credit
for that purchase.

830
00:42:37.966 --> 00:42:39.726
I'm going to bring
this up one more time.

831
00:42:40.156 --> 00:42:44.016
Now if I had decided to click
on - to tap on the store link

832
00:42:44.016 --> 00:42:46.926
in the upper right, then
the user would be taken

833
00:42:46.926 --> 00:42:49.206
to the App Store.

834
00:42:49.616 --> 00:42:54.246
That same content would
be displayed, and anything

835
00:42:54.246 --> 00:42:57.926
that that user bought within
the 24-hour bounty window, you,

836
00:42:57.926 --> 00:42:59.456
the affiliate, would
receive a commission

837
00:42:59.866 --> 00:43:00.836
on all those purchases.

838
00:42:59.866 --> 00:43:00.836
on all those purchases.

839
00:43:01.496 --> 00:43:02.996
So I'm going to switch over now

840
00:43:03.406 --> 00:43:09.206
and show you what
actually happened there.

841
00:43:09.436 --> 00:43:12.046
So here we have the
new affiliate dashboard

842
00:43:12.116 --> 00:43:16.536
that Mark showed before,
and this is live in Safari,

843
00:43:17.816 --> 00:43:20.376
and you can see that
there are the clicks

844
00:43:20.416 --> 00:43:21.516
that I made during the demo.

845
00:43:22.036 --> 00:43:23.746
They've already showed
up, the taps that I made.

846
00:43:24.006 --> 00:43:26.646
This bump here earlier is when
I was rehearsing beforehand.

847
00:43:27.516 --> 00:43:32.106
And so this shows the near
real-time tracking of all

848
00:43:32.166 --> 00:43:34.426
of the affiliate data.

849
00:43:34.966 --> 00:43:40.586
So I'm going to put this
away and bring up Xcode

850
00:43:42.926 --> 00:43:44.396
and show you exactly
how you can go

851
00:43:44.396 --> 00:43:46.816
about putting the StoreKit
Product Sheet in your own apps.

852
00:43:47.136 --> 00:43:47.856
It's very simple.

853
00:43:48.776 --> 00:43:55.966
So the first thing you need
to make sure you do is link

854
00:43:55.966 --> 00:43:59.156
against the StoreKit framework.

855
00:43:59.536 --> 00:44:01.706
This is a public
framework that is available

856
00:43:59.536 --> 00:44:01.706
This is a public
framework that is available

857
00:44:01.706 --> 00:44:04.566
to any iOS developer,
and it lets you interact

858
00:44:04.716 --> 00:44:07.486
with the iTunes Store, the
App Store in various ways.

859
00:44:07.566 --> 00:44:10.156
In this case, the way is by
the StoreKit Product Sheet.

860
00:44:10.816 --> 00:44:15.596
So here we have the header
for our main ViewController,

861
00:44:16.556 --> 00:44:19.586
and again, just showing here

862
00:44:19.966 --> 00:44:23.026
that we are importing
the StoreKit framework

863
00:44:23.586 --> 00:44:25.746
that lets us access the
StoreKit Product Sheet.

864
00:44:26.806 --> 00:44:29.116
Sorry, this is all objective
so you haven't had a chance

865
00:44:29.116 --> 00:44:31.706
to write it in Swift just yet.

866
00:44:32.256 --> 00:44:34.876
So here we have the
implementation

867
00:44:35.876 --> 00:44:40.086
for the ViewController, and this
is the key method right here.

868
00:44:40.086 --> 00:44:41.746
This is the method
that I have defined

869
00:44:41.746 --> 00:44:43.116
on the ViewController class,

870
00:44:43.466 --> 00:44:48.936
which I've called simply
Store Sheet for Product -

871
00:44:49.286 --> 00:44:54.066
takes three parameters, the
itunesId, the affiliateToken

872
00:44:54.126 --> 00:44:55.226
and the campaignToken.

873
00:44:56.026 --> 00:44:58.516
Now this is the new
difference in iOS 8.

874
00:44:58.956 --> 00:45:03.616
As Mark mentioned, the StoreKit
Product Sheet itself has been

875
00:44:58.956 --> 00:45:03.616
As Mark mentioned, the StoreKit
Product Sheet itself has been

876
00:45:03.616 --> 00:45:05.756
available since iOS
6, but previously,

877
00:45:05.756 --> 00:45:07.876
you could not include
the affiliate data.

878
00:45:08.116 --> 00:45:10.506
Only one parameter was accepted,
which was the itunesId.

879
00:45:11.546 --> 00:45:13.076
So now you can add
the affiliateToken.

880
00:45:13.076 --> 00:45:15.366
That's your usual affiliate
token that identifies you.

881
00:45:15.966 --> 00:45:18.386
And the campaignToken,
which as Mark mentioned,

882
00:45:18.386 --> 00:45:20.656
can be any string up to
40 characters in length

883
00:45:21.046 --> 00:45:23.326
that you can use to identify
your different campaigns,

884
00:45:23.366 --> 00:45:27.686
group your data however
you want to analyze it.

885
00:45:29.576 --> 00:45:33.366
So I take these three
parameters, and I put them

886
00:45:33.366 --> 00:45:35.436
into a standard NSDictionary.

887
00:45:35.886 --> 00:45:41.386
Move this so you
can see this better.

888
00:45:41.386 --> 00:45:42.306
Simple dictionary.

889
00:45:42.736 --> 00:45:44.906
These are symbolic
constants that are defined

890
00:45:44.906 --> 00:45:46.106
in the StoreKit framework.

891
00:45:46.106 --> 00:45:52.986
The SKStoreProductParameter
ITunesItemIdentifier is

892
00:45:53.196 --> 00:45:54.176
the itunesId.

893
00:45:54.176 --> 00:45:56.746
That's this one that you
passed in and the two new ones,

894
00:45:56.786 --> 00:45:58.576
the
ProductParameterAffiliateToken

895
00:45:58.916 --> 00:46:00.866
and the
ProductParameterCampaignToken.

896
00:45:58.916 --> 00:46:00.866
and the
ProductParameterCampaignToken.

897
00:46:01.186 --> 00:46:02.206
Those are optional.

898
00:46:02.206 --> 00:46:04.786
You don't need to include them,
but since you are an affiliate,

899
00:46:04.786 --> 00:46:06.166
you probably do want
to include them

900
00:46:06.326 --> 00:46:07.536
so that you earn
your commissions.

901
00:46:08.206 --> 00:46:13.386
So the next thing you need
to do is actually create

902
00:46:13.386 --> 00:46:14.156
to the ViewController.

903
00:46:14.326 --> 00:46:18.586
You do that using a standard
Objective-C, alloc init model,

904
00:46:18.966 --> 00:46:21.726
which you're probably
familiar with, and you need

905
00:46:21.726 --> 00:46:23.976
to set a delegate for it,
which will be called back

906
00:46:24.016 --> 00:46:25.986
when it's time to
dismiss the sheet.

907
00:46:26.626 --> 00:46:28.776
And in this case, we're
simply setting the delegate

908
00:46:28.896 --> 00:46:31.786
to ourselves, the same
ViewController object

909
00:46:31.916 --> 00:46:32.416
that we're using.

910
00:46:33.606 --> 00:46:36.846
So here's the key
call right here.

911
00:46:37.426 --> 00:46:40.516
We need to load the
product into the controller.

912
00:46:41.536 --> 00:46:43.486
So this is the method

913
00:46:43.576 --> 00:46:47.566
on the StoreKit View
Product Controller.

914
00:46:47.566 --> 00:46:49.386
Load product with parameters.

915
00:46:49.926 --> 00:46:51.726
Parameters is the
dictionary we just created

916
00:46:51.966 --> 00:46:54.506
that contains again, the
iTunes ID, the affiliate token

917
00:46:54.506 --> 00:46:56.896
and the campaign token.

918
00:46:57.306 --> 00:46:59.076
It also takes a completion
block,

919
00:46:59.446 --> 00:47:02.146
which is the standard
Objective-C block,

920
00:46:59.446 --> 00:47:02.146
which is the standard
Objective-C block,

921
00:47:03.616 --> 00:47:08.056
which will return a
result, simply yes or no

922
00:47:08.056 --> 00:47:09.826
as to whether it
successfully loaded.

923
00:47:10.206 --> 00:47:12.316
And in the case that it
didn't successfully load

924
00:47:12.316 --> 00:47:16.106
for some reason, say that you
somehow had an incorrect piece

925
00:47:16.106 --> 00:47:19.336
of content that didn't
actually exist on the store,

926
00:47:19.806 --> 00:47:20.846
there's an error parameter.

927
00:47:21.816 --> 00:47:24.986
And in the block, we define
what we do in these two cases.

928
00:47:25.166 --> 00:47:26.466
In this case, if
there's an error,

929
00:47:26.466 --> 00:47:27.786
we're just logging it normally.

930
00:47:27.786 --> 00:47:29.116
In an actual app, you
would probably want

931
00:47:29.116 --> 00:47:32.426
to display some sort of dialogue
or UI to the user saying

932
00:47:32.426 --> 00:47:34.406
that this content for
whatever reason failed

933
00:47:34.406 --> 00:47:37.066
to load in the sheet.

934
00:47:37.066 --> 00:47:38.506
And if it successfully loaded,

935
00:47:38.886 --> 00:47:40.596
here we're simply
logging that it loaded.

936
00:47:40.596 --> 00:47:42.246
Normally you wouldn't
need to do anything

937
00:47:42.246 --> 00:47:43.976
in that case, just go on.

938
00:47:44.246 --> 00:47:47.496
So at this point, you
have loaded the product

939
00:47:47.496 --> 00:47:49.536
into the sheet but you
haven't actually displayed it.

940
00:47:49.536 --> 00:47:51.436
So that's what this
call is here.

941
00:47:52.506 --> 00:47:57.476
So we call on ourself,
which is our ViewController,

942
00:47:58.656 --> 00:48:00.296
present the sheetController.

943
00:47:58.656 --> 00:48:00.296
present the sheetController.

944
00:48:00.916 --> 00:48:03.716
Animated, you normally
want a yes,

945
00:48:03.716 --> 00:48:06.266
and that also takes
a completion block.

946
00:48:06.986 --> 00:48:08.776
And in this case again,
we aren't doing anything

947
00:48:08.776 --> 00:48:10.126
in particular in the
completion block.

948
00:48:10.626 --> 00:48:12.666
Just for reference, we're
logging that we've completed.

949
00:48:13.836 --> 00:48:20.266
One more important
method here is productView

950
00:48:20.266 --> 00:48:21.456
ControllerDidFinish.

951
00:48:21.456 --> 00:48:22.816
This is the callback method

952
00:48:23.516 --> 00:48:28.306
that gets called whenever the
sheet action is complete either

953
00:48:28.306 --> 00:48:30.716
by the user clicking cancel,
clicking outside of the sheet

954
00:48:30.996 --> 00:48:32.386
or going elsewhere
from the sheet.

955
00:48:34.086 --> 00:48:36.866
And this is where you
actually dismiss the sheet

956
00:48:37.316 --> 00:48:38.116
to get it to go away.

957
00:48:38.116 --> 00:48:39.236
Otherwise, it will remain up.

958
00:48:39.456 --> 00:48:43.226
The cancel action won't
appear to have done anything.

959
00:48:43.606 --> 00:48:48.936
And this is simply the IBAction,
the Interface Builder action

960
00:48:49.426 --> 00:48:53.676
that we tied to the button
that was in the top of the app

961
00:48:54.506 --> 00:48:58.196
and simply in this case,
preloads it with the iTunesId

962
00:48:58.196 --> 00:49:01.196
of that juggling pinball
app that I showed,

963
00:48:58.196 --> 00:49:01.196
of that juggling pinball
app that I showed,

964
00:49:01.766 --> 00:49:03.746
and the affiliateToken
and the campaignToken.

965
00:49:04.306 --> 00:49:07.176
The code for getting the guy to
do the juggling trick is left

966
00:49:07.176 --> 00:49:08.396
as an exercise for the viewer.

967
00:49:09.366 --> 00:49:12.286
So that's the StoreKit
Product Sheet.

968
00:49:12.796 --> 00:49:13.976
It's very simple to implement.

969
00:49:13.976 --> 00:49:16.286
It's just a couple of calls
and it's pretty powerful

970
00:49:16.286 --> 00:49:17.636
in conjunction with
the affiliate program.

971
00:49:18.066 --> 00:49:18.626
Thank you.

972
00:49:19.516 --> 00:49:23.566
[ Applause ]

973
00:49:24.066 --> 00:49:25.246
>> Back to you, Mark.

974
00:49:26.046 --> 00:49:26.676
>> All right.

975
00:49:27.006 --> 00:49:27.606
Thanks very much, Rick.

976
00:49:27.636 --> 00:49:28.026
That was awesome.

977
00:49:28.356 --> 00:49:30.736
So like he said, StoreKit
Product Sheet, you can do a lot

978
00:49:30.736 --> 00:49:33.426
with it, and best of
all, for your users,

979
00:49:33.426 --> 00:49:37.476
it's very unintrusive,
so take a look.

980
00:49:38.926 --> 00:49:43.526
Next up on our list of things
to talk about is iTunes Radio.

981
00:49:43.976 --> 00:49:45.516
Now iTunes Radio
launched recently,

982
00:49:46.016 --> 00:49:50.356
and even more recently,
we have added it

983
00:49:50.486 --> 00:49:54.446
to the affiliate program,
which means that if you link

984
00:49:54.646 --> 00:50:00.626
to an iTunes Radio station, you
get credited for that referral.

985
00:49:54.646 --> 00:50:00.626
to an iTunes Radio station, you
get credited for that referral.

986
00:50:02.056 --> 00:50:04.126
And again, it's very easy to do.

987
00:50:04.126 --> 00:50:07.566
Here's another example
using our friend Ed Sheeran,

988
00:50:07.956 --> 00:50:11.236
and we're in the Sound Hound
app, and they've got a link

989
00:50:11.436 --> 00:50:15.466
down near the bottom of -
that links to iTunes Radio.

990
00:50:15.966 --> 00:50:19.306
And when the user taps on that,
the radio station is going

991
00:50:19.306 --> 00:50:22.836
to be created and added to
their stations, and the song

992
00:50:23.176 --> 00:50:25.436
that the radio station
starts with begins to play.

993
00:50:25.876 --> 00:50:29.306
So this is a great
way to tell your users

994
00:50:29.306 --> 00:50:33.546
or to recommend a certain
set of content to your users.

995
00:50:33.816 --> 00:50:35.606
Maybe they don't want to buy
it, but they want to listen

996
00:50:35.606 --> 00:50:39.436
to music that's inspired by
a particular artist or song.

997
00:50:39.886 --> 00:50:44.116
You can get them into the
iTunes Radio experience

998
00:50:44.546 --> 00:50:46.746
and listening to
music immediately.

999
00:50:47.836 --> 00:50:52.356
Best of all, this is supported
with the affiliate program

1000
00:50:52.526 --> 00:50:54.656
with the same terms
as everything else.

1001
00:50:54.706 --> 00:50:58.236
So 7 percent over 24 hours,
and that applies not just

1002
00:50:58.236 --> 00:51:00.806
to purchases made within
the iTunes Radio app,

1003
00:50:58.236 --> 00:51:00.806
to purchases made within
the iTunes Radio app,

1004
00:51:01.246 --> 00:51:04.646
but any other store on that same
device where the cookie exists.

1005
00:51:04.866 --> 00:51:08.396
So that means music, of
course, apps, books, movies,

1006
00:51:08.666 --> 00:51:12.336
all the rest, are all supported
under the affiliate program.

1007
00:51:13.696 --> 00:51:17.346
Now to construct a
link to iTunes Radio,

1008
00:51:17.766 --> 00:51:22.206
we've added some functionality
to the Search and Lookup APIs

1009
00:51:22.206 --> 00:51:25.096
so that the content result
that you see will have links

1010
00:51:25.096 --> 00:51:26.446
to the radio stations
themselves.

1011
00:51:27.396 --> 00:51:31.496
So here, we're looking for Ed
Sheeran, and in the result set

1012
00:51:31.496 --> 00:51:33.796
that we get back, we're
looking for an artist.

1013
00:51:34.676 --> 00:51:39.706
The JSON has a radio
station URL, and you can use

1014
00:51:39.706 --> 00:51:44.726
that special URL to launch into
the iTunes Radio application.

1015
00:51:45.646 --> 00:51:48.186
You would of course have to add
your affiliate data to this URL

1016
00:51:48.186 --> 00:51:48.976
as we've been discussing.

1017
00:51:49.616 --> 00:51:51.566
So that's iTunes Radio.

1018
00:51:52.146 --> 00:51:56.266
It's a great set of music
for users to listen to,

1019
00:51:56.566 --> 00:51:59.576
and you get a bonus
for any purchases made

1020
00:51:59.576 --> 00:52:00.596
after clicking that link.

1021
00:51:59.576 --> 00:52:00.596
after clicking that link.

1022
00:52:01.866 --> 00:52:05.336
We're going to end up talking
today about collections,

1023
00:52:06.036 --> 00:52:09.756
and collections are something
you might be familiar

1024
00:52:09.756 --> 00:52:11.126
with from previous talks.

1025
00:52:11.126 --> 00:52:16.496
It used to be called Web iMix,
but this is a dynamic playlist

1026
00:52:16.906 --> 00:52:18.876
that is defined entirely
by a URL,

1027
00:52:18.876 --> 00:52:21.106
and here's what it looks like.

1028
00:52:21.716 --> 00:52:23.286
This is a collection
we've defined

1029
00:52:23.286 --> 00:52:26.776
by creating a special URL,
and we've set the title.

1030
00:52:27.916 --> 00:52:30.236
We've set the description.

1031
00:52:30.676 --> 00:52:32.836
Now there's a limit on what
kind of text you can put

1032
00:52:32.836 --> 00:52:35.996
in the description,
but it's fairly broad.

1033
00:52:36.906 --> 00:52:39.476
And finally, we can
actually define the content

1034
00:52:39.896 --> 00:52:41.716
of the playlist itself.

1035
00:52:42.086 --> 00:52:45.606
So here we've got four
songs by Ed Sheeran,

1036
00:52:46.226 --> 00:52:49.386
and the user can buy each
of these individually

1037
00:52:49.636 --> 00:52:53.686
or tap a single click and
buy the whole thing at once.

1038
00:52:55.556 --> 00:52:58.556
So how do we do this?

1039
00:52:58.606 --> 00:53:01.276
The - to create a Collection
Link you need set something

1040
00:52:58.606 --> 00:53:01.276
The - to create a Collection
Link you need set something

1041
00:53:01.276 --> 00:53:02.066
up beforehand.

1042
00:53:02.506 --> 00:53:06.326
What you need in addition to
the normal affiliate signup is

1043
00:53:06.326 --> 00:53:10.446
to get a special
collection account with us.

1044
00:53:10.566 --> 00:53:14.426
We will tell you a
special web developer ID

1045
00:53:14.806 --> 00:53:18.436
and a shared secret, and
the shared secret is used

1046
00:53:18.436 --> 00:53:21.056
to cryptographically
sign these URLs,

1047
00:53:21.476 --> 00:53:24.366
so we know who the
author is of that title,

1048
00:53:24.366 --> 00:53:25.756
and description and the content.

1049
00:53:28.866 --> 00:53:33.086
Collections support songs,
albums, movies, TV shows

1050
00:53:33.086 --> 00:53:36.456
and music videos, so you can
have kind of a wide-ranging set

1051
00:53:36.456 --> 00:53:37.586
of content that you link to,

1052
00:53:38.026 --> 00:53:40.656
and this could actually
be pretty high value.

1053
00:53:40.926 --> 00:53:42.826
If you know your
user is interested

1054
00:53:42.826 --> 00:53:46.886
in six different movies,
and they're ready to buy,

1055
00:53:46.936 --> 00:53:49.726
they're ready to go, you can put
a single link in front of them

1056
00:53:49.856 --> 00:53:52.186
and they can buy six
movies with one tap.

1057
00:53:52.666 --> 00:53:57.216
That can mean a lot of money
in terms of commissions.

1058
00:53:57.676 --> 00:54:02.476
To get started with the
Collection system, you -

1059
00:53:57.676 --> 00:54:02.476
To get started with the
Collection system, you -

1060
00:54:02.476 --> 00:54:04.316
there's a bunch of
documentation available online,

1061
00:54:04.976 --> 00:54:08.236
but let's take a look at what
these links actually look like.

1062
00:54:08.346 --> 00:54:09.836
They're rather intimidating
at first,

1063
00:54:09.866 --> 00:54:11.026
but we can break
them down for you.

1064
00:54:12.036 --> 00:54:15.906
We start with the Prefix,
which - has a little bit

1065
00:54:15.906 --> 00:54:17.236
of history, viewWebIMix.

1066
00:54:19.076 --> 00:54:21.586
There's the title that we
defined, of course URL encoded.

1067
00:54:22.196 --> 00:54:24.016
The description is
also in there,

1068
00:54:24.816 --> 00:54:28.466
and the IDs that we
wanted, URL-encoded again

1069
00:54:28.886 --> 00:54:31.436
so that the link actually
works, are in there.

1070
00:54:32.746 --> 00:54:34.726
Additionally, we've
passed in a wdID.

1071
00:54:34.726 --> 00:54:36.316
That's the Web Developer ID.

1072
00:54:36.806 --> 00:54:39.616
And we've signed - we've done
a little bit of cryptography

1073
00:54:39.616 --> 00:54:41.336
and we've added a
key to the URL,

1074
00:54:41.396 --> 00:54:43.096
and we put that into
the key parameter.

1075
00:54:43.806 --> 00:54:47.326
And finally, we've got our
affiliates hooking up at the top

1076
00:54:47.786 --> 00:54:50.236
because we want to
get a commission

1077
00:54:50.236 --> 00:54:51.026
on this link of course.

1078
00:54:52.306 --> 00:54:55.176
So this is a great way to
make things happen on the fly

1079
00:54:55.176 --> 00:54:59.846
if your user has a special set
of desires that you know about.

1080
00:55:00.066 --> 00:55:03.376
You can put together a single
collection with this on the fly.

1081
00:55:03.736 --> 00:55:05.106
You don't need to
do - you don't need

1082
00:55:05.106 --> 00:55:08.256
to register a particular
collection beforehand.

1083
00:55:08.526 --> 00:55:10.536
Once you're signed up, you
can do this any time you want.

1084
00:55:10.816 --> 00:55:13.626
Now on the other hand,
maybe you don't want

1085
00:55:13.626 --> 00:55:14.776
to have the difficulty

1086
00:55:14.776 --> 00:55:17.016
of defining these
URLs programmatically.

1087
00:55:17.376 --> 00:55:18.726
For that, we have
Collection Builder,

1088
00:55:19.386 --> 00:55:25.566
and this is a really simple
UI to define the title

1089
00:55:25.566 --> 00:55:27.186
and description and the content.

1090
00:55:27.606 --> 00:55:30.476
And the Collection Builder,
if you pass in a wdID

1091
00:55:30.476 --> 00:55:33.576
and your shared secret,
will create the URL for you.

1092
00:55:33.766 --> 00:55:37.206
So if you've got maybe
a game and you want

1093
00:55:37.206 --> 00:55:40.146
to promote the soundtrack
to the game,

1094
00:55:40.146 --> 00:55:42.666
and maybe you've got a
comic iBook that kind

1095
00:55:42.666 --> 00:55:45.036
of expands the game's universe
- something like that -

1096
00:55:45.286 --> 00:55:48.576
you can define that very
easily via Collection Builder.

1097
00:55:50.016 --> 00:55:51.866
Once you've got your
title and description,

1098
00:55:52.236 --> 00:55:55.076
you can start searching
for additional content,

1099
00:55:55.476 --> 00:56:01.246
add that to your dynamic
playlist, and you hit go,

1100
00:55:55.476 --> 00:56:01.246
add that to your dynamic
playlist, and you hit go,

1101
00:56:01.276 --> 00:56:05.446
and you get a collection
URL that you can paste

1102
00:56:05.446 --> 00:56:08.736
into your web page or into
your app, whatever you need.

1103
00:56:09.226 --> 00:56:10.626
So that's Collection Builder.

1104
00:56:12.066 --> 00:56:16.486
There's a lot of interesting
things you can do with that

1105
00:56:16.486 --> 00:56:17.716
with the right situation.

1106
00:56:18.496 --> 00:56:23.556
So to summarize, most
important thing to take away

1107
00:56:23.556 --> 00:56:25.266
with you right today is

1108
00:56:25.266 --> 00:56:28.156
that we've got one program
that works worldwide.

1109
00:56:28.436 --> 00:56:31.876
Sign up is trivially easy, and
once you do that, you're going

1110
00:56:31.876 --> 00:56:35.596
to be able to market your
content in 147 countries,

1111
00:56:35.906 --> 00:56:37.266
and that list is
growing as well.

1112
00:56:38.556 --> 00:56:41.576
We've got a simplified link
structure, so you don't have

1113
00:56:41.756 --> 00:56:45.576
to figure out what one
URL looks like to one user

1114
00:56:45.956 --> 00:56:48.566
and then present a
different URL to another user

1115
00:56:48.566 --> 00:56:49.296
in a different region.

1116
00:56:50.196 --> 00:56:51.906
That is a huge headache removed.

1117
00:56:52.726 --> 00:56:55.696
We've got a unified dashboard,
so we can see what's going

1118
00:56:55.696 --> 00:56:59.046
on at a glance across the
world, or we can drill

1119
00:56:59.046 --> 00:57:02.236
down into a particular country,
a particular content type.

1120
00:56:59.046 --> 00:57:02.236
down into a particular country,
a particular content type.

1121
00:57:02.716 --> 00:57:05.946
Really powerful, real
time, really great.

1122
00:57:07.406 --> 00:57:09.106
We've got a great new
commission structure:

1123
00:57:09.296 --> 00:57:11.596
7 percent over 24 hours.

1124
00:57:11.626 --> 00:57:14.326
That can mean a lot
to your bottom line.

1125
00:57:14.716 --> 00:57:17.936
We've added iTunes Radio and
the StoreKit Product Sheet

1126
00:57:17.936 --> 00:57:20.626
to the affiliate program so you
get credit - the same structure

1127
00:57:20.626 --> 00:57:22.596
as everything else
by using that.

1128
00:57:23.516 --> 00:57:26.396
And of course, we've got
a lot of tools and a lot

1129
00:57:26.396 --> 00:57:28.166
of documentation
available online.

1130
00:57:28.496 --> 00:57:29.426
So check it out.

1131
00:57:30.856 --> 00:57:33.526
The documentation - we
have a whole resource site

1132
00:57:33.526 --> 00:57:35.266
at affiliate.iTunes.apple.com.

1133
00:57:35.616 --> 00:57:36.926
Highly recommend
checking that out.

1134
00:57:37.266 --> 00:57:39.206
There's a support link
available too, and of course,

1135
00:57:39.206 --> 00:57:41.316
there's devforums if you
any questions that you want

1136
00:57:41.316 --> 00:57:43.136
to ask your fellow developers.

1137
00:57:43.376 --> 00:57:47.816
There's a related
session happening tomorrow

1138
00:57:48.016 --> 00:57:49.526
about using StoreKit.

1139
00:57:49.736 --> 00:57:51.536
It's called "Optimizing
In-App Purchases,"

1140
00:57:51.956 --> 00:57:54.466
and they'll be covering a bit

1141
00:57:54.466 --> 00:57:55.876
about the StoreKit
Product Sheet there.

1142
00:57:55.876 --> 00:57:58.316
And if you have any questions
about the affiliate program

1143
00:57:58.316 --> 00:58:00.406
or the StoreKit Product
Sheet, we've got a couple labs

1144
00:57:58.316 --> 00:58:00.406
or the StoreKit Product
Sheet, we've got a couple labs

1145
00:58:00.406 --> 00:58:01.246
in the next couple days.

1146
00:58:01.646 --> 00:58:06.806
We're going to be downstairs at
2 p.m. so feel free to come by,

1147
00:58:06.806 --> 00:58:07.896
say hello, ask some questions.

1148
00:58:07.896 --> 00:58:08.746
We'll be glad to help.

1149
00:58:08.816 --> 00:58:11.086
That's it for the
presentation today.

1150
00:58:11.446 --> 00:58:12.976
Thanks all for coming and have
a great rest of the conference.

1151
00:58:13.516 --> 00:58:20.560
[ Applause ]
