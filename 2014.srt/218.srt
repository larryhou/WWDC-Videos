1
00:00:11.516 --> 00:00:15.736
[ Applause ]

2
00:00:16.236 --> 00:00:17.206
>> Hi, everybody.

3
00:00:17.356 --> 00:00:18.106
Good morning.

4
00:00:18.256 --> 00:00:21.286
My name is Rachel
Roth and I'm one

5
00:00:21.286 --> 00:00:23.556
of Apple's User Experience
Evangelists.

6
00:00:24.746 --> 00:00:28.366
Now this session is
not about monetizing.

7
00:00:28.876 --> 00:00:33.846
It's about having a great
experience with in-app purchases

8
00:00:34.536 --> 00:00:36.716
because a great experience
is what's going

9
00:00:36.716 --> 00:00:39.966
to keep people coming back
to your app or game time

10
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.836
and time and time again.

11
00:00:42.746 --> 00:00:45.616
Think about the last time you
had a really fantastic meal

12
00:00:45.616 --> 00:00:46.726
at a great restaurant.

13
00:00:47.496 --> 00:00:49.666
So it's a place you always
want to come back to, right?

14
00:00:50.846 --> 00:00:54.376
So this is the bigger
picture of what it takes

15
00:00:54.416 --> 00:00:57.066
to have a great experience
with in-app purchases

16
00:00:57.786 --> 00:01:01.466
and today's session is all
based on the assumption

17
00:00:57.786 --> 00:01:01.466
and today's session is all
based on the assumption

18
00:01:01.556 --> 00:01:05.296
that you already have a
really amazing app or game.

19
00:01:06.756 --> 00:01:09.636
Your app meets the
needs of your audience.

20
00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:12.566
It's got a really
intuitive interface design.

21
00:01:13.046 --> 00:01:14.636
It's been executed really well.

22
00:01:15.586 --> 00:01:17.326
For game, it's just fun to play.

23
00:01:17.916 --> 00:01:20.046
And there's really
no design secrets

24
00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:21.546
or shortcuts around this one.

25
00:01:21.906 --> 00:01:23.746
But I know that you guys
all have it handled.

26
00:01:24.346 --> 00:01:27.316
So we don't have to dwell
on this for too long.

27
00:01:27.906 --> 00:01:30.606
Now, if you're using the
freemium or the paymium model

28
00:01:30.606 --> 00:01:33.456
with in-app purchases,
it's so important

29
00:01:33.456 --> 00:01:37.756
that people can enjoy your app
or game without buying anything.

30
00:01:38.626 --> 00:01:40.866
I mean, I think most of us
have had the experience.

31
00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:43.746
You get a new app from the
App Store and you download it

32
00:01:43.746 --> 00:01:45.846
and you launch it only to find

33
00:01:45.846 --> 00:01:47.516
that you can't do
anything with it.

34
00:01:48.416 --> 00:01:49.476
That's frustrating.

35
00:01:49.706 --> 00:01:51.326
You need to make it
a purchase in order

36
00:01:51.326 --> 00:01:52.866
to get some utility out of it.

37
00:01:54.116 --> 00:01:57.086
It would be like if you bought
a mixer for your kitchen

38
00:01:57.086 --> 00:01:59.316
and it didn't come
with any attachments.

39
00:01:59.316 --> 00:02:01.166
You couldn't mix anything.

40
00:01:59.316 --> 00:02:01.166
You couldn't mix anything.

41
00:02:02.256 --> 00:02:03.626
That would be really
disappointing.

42
00:02:04.176 --> 00:02:07.546
And that's why mixers come
with a basic attachment

43
00:02:07.546 --> 00:02:10.776
that you can use to mix and
see how great the mixer is.

44
00:02:10.816 --> 00:02:14.986
And then you buy some additional
attachments for specialty tasks

45
00:02:14.986 --> 00:02:17.796
like making bread or
some kind of pastry.

46
00:02:18.656 --> 00:02:21.146
And that's what you want
to achieve with your apps.

47
00:02:21.406 --> 00:02:24.586
You want to let people really
enjoy the functionality

48
00:02:24.586 --> 00:02:28.466
and the utility, the
quality of your app,

49
00:02:28.466 --> 00:02:30.666
and then you offer
them advantages

50
00:02:30.666 --> 00:02:34.676
or additional functionality,
some advanced features.

51
00:02:34.676 --> 00:02:38.226
And when you offer those
things, you want to make sure

52
00:02:38.226 --> 00:02:39.766
that you make buying easy.

53
00:02:40.776 --> 00:02:43.996
And I know this probably sounds
obvious but I'm not just talking

54
00:02:43.996 --> 00:02:46.986
about sending the
transaction to the App Store

55
00:02:46.986 --> 00:02:48.056
and getting a response back.

56
00:02:48.996 --> 00:02:50.686
You want to make sure
that the decision

57
00:02:50.686 --> 00:02:52.906
to buy something is really easy

58
00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:54.816
for the people coming
to your app or game.

59
00:02:55.796 --> 00:03:00.896
There's a lot of friction to
making that decision to buy

60
00:02:55.796 --> 00:03:00.896
There's a lot of friction to
making that decision to buy

61
00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:03.456
and a lot of it is
outside of your control.

62
00:03:04.586 --> 00:03:08.066
But as app developers, you
want to eliminate any obstacle

63
00:03:08.306 --> 00:03:09.306
to making that decision

64
00:03:09.306 --> 00:03:11.356
to purchase something
inside of your app.

65
00:03:11.926 --> 00:03:14.976
Make it easy as possible
because that decision

66
00:03:14.976 --> 00:03:19.136
to buy is a fleeting moment
and there's many traps.

67
00:03:20.156 --> 00:03:23.346
So one of the best
things that you can do is

68
00:03:23.346 --> 00:03:25.926
to integrate your merchandise
into the experience.

69
00:03:26.966 --> 00:03:28.626
I mean, people aren't
going to buy things

70
00:03:28.626 --> 00:03:30.206
if they don't know
what you're offering,

71
00:03:30.266 --> 00:03:31.456
if they can't see them.

72
00:03:32.356 --> 00:03:34.146
I talk to a lot of developers

73
00:03:34.226 --> 00:03:37.476
who create a really great store
section inside of their app

74
00:03:37.476 --> 00:03:39.426
or game and then they're
really disappointed

75
00:03:39.426 --> 00:03:40.716
because no one's going there.

76
00:03:41.066 --> 00:03:42.146
They're not buying anything.

77
00:03:42.686 --> 00:03:44.546
That's because people don't
know what you're offering.

78
00:03:45.216 --> 00:03:47.046
It's kind of like the
difference of if I said,

79
00:03:47.046 --> 00:03:49.026
"Do you want to buy something?"

80
00:03:49.846 --> 00:03:51.936
Or if I said, "How would you

81
00:03:51.936 --> 00:03:53.656
like a really great
drawing tool?"

82
00:03:54.266 --> 00:03:58.126
And that's what you want to
help explain with your app

83
00:03:58.166 --> 00:04:00.186
by putting the merchandise
out on display,

84
00:03:58.166 --> 00:04:00.186
by putting the merchandise
out on display,

85
00:04:00.876 --> 00:04:02.876
integrating it into
the experience.

86
00:04:03.846 --> 00:04:06.366
But when you're doing
that, I'm not suggesting

87
00:04:06.366 --> 00:04:08.906
that you become a pushy
salesperson about it.

88
00:04:09.386 --> 00:04:12.606
Nobody wants this guy following
them around saying, "Hey,

89
00:04:12.606 --> 00:04:13.676
you want to buy something?

90
00:04:13.676 --> 00:04:14.706
Hey, hey, hey.

91
00:04:14.706 --> 00:04:15.546
You want to buy something?

92
00:04:15.546 --> 00:04:16.606
Do you want to buy something?

93
00:04:16.606 --> 00:04:17.555
Do you want to buy something?"

94
00:04:17.976 --> 00:04:20.296
Every minute, and that's
what you're risking

95
00:04:20.296 --> 00:04:23.276
if you're flashing a lot
of alerts or notifications

96
00:04:23.276 --> 00:04:26.486
or crazy animations to try and
entice people into that store.

97
00:04:27.956 --> 00:04:29.876
It's really about timing.

98
00:04:30.526 --> 00:04:32.676
And with some apps, it's

99
00:04:32.676 --> 00:04:35.956
about offering the right
thing at the right time.

100
00:04:36.416 --> 00:04:39.476
Like at a restaurant, when the
waiter brings you the dessert

101
00:04:39.476 --> 00:04:40.556
menu at the end of the meal.

102
00:04:41.606 --> 00:04:43.796
I mean, you might not
even want dessert, right,

103
00:04:43.926 --> 00:04:45.706
but it doesn't feel pushy
that they offered it.

104
00:04:47.116 --> 00:04:50.116
It would feel pushy if they
offered it to you before you sat

105
00:04:50.116 --> 00:04:52.766
down and while you're
eating your appetizer.

106
00:04:53.796 --> 00:04:56.136
So you want to think about
what's the right moment

107
00:04:56.136 --> 00:04:58.486
to offer something
to someone and do

108
00:04:58.486 --> 00:04:59.896
that in a way that's
really thoughtful.

109
00:05:01.196 --> 00:05:04.196
Now with other apps, it's
about the presentation.

110
00:05:05.186 --> 00:05:08.376
You want to think about a
really great window display

111
00:05:08.376 --> 00:05:09.206
for a store.

112
00:05:10.066 --> 00:05:11.636
I happen to be very partial

113
00:05:11.636 --> 00:05:13.516
to the Apple Retail
window displays.

114
00:05:13.696 --> 00:05:15.736
I'm sure that will come as
no surprise to you guys.

115
00:05:17.236 --> 00:05:18.616
Now they do a great job

116
00:05:18.616 --> 00:05:21.306
of showing off the
merchandise and drawing you in.

117
00:05:21.426 --> 00:05:23.596
It makes you want to find
out more about the products.

118
00:05:23.596 --> 00:05:24.776
It's really intriguing.

119
00:05:25.496 --> 00:05:26.976
And that's what you
want to think

120
00:05:26.976 --> 00:05:28.586
about with your app
or your game.

121
00:05:29.176 --> 00:05:31.216
You want to integrate
the merchandise in a way

122
00:05:31.216 --> 00:05:32.756
that feels really natural.

123
00:05:34.216 --> 00:05:36.736
This is Paper by Fifty Three.

124
00:05:37.036 --> 00:05:39.586
It's an Apple Design Award
winner from years ago

125
00:05:39.586 --> 00:05:41.906
that is still a fantastic
example

126
00:05:41.996 --> 00:05:45.396
of integrating in-app
purchases into their experience.

127
00:05:46.286 --> 00:05:49.806
If you haven't used it, the app
is designed to capture ideas

128
00:05:49.866 --> 00:05:52.596
through sketches and
diagrams and notes.

129
00:05:53.726 --> 00:05:55.656
And like that mixer
in your kitchen,

130
00:05:55.656 --> 00:05:58.246
they give you some basic
drawing tools for free,

131
00:05:59.016 --> 00:06:00.446
your pen and your eraser.

132
00:05:59.016 --> 00:06:00.446
your pen and your eraser.

133
00:06:01.626 --> 00:06:02.946
And you can see from
this example

134
00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:04.386
that you can do tons with it.

135
00:06:05.266 --> 00:06:06.446
But there might be an occasion

136
00:06:06.446 --> 00:06:09.306
when you need a more advanced
drawing tool or a different kind

137
00:06:09.306 --> 00:06:13.746
of line or texture and so that's
why they leave these empty spots

138
00:06:13.746 --> 00:06:16.226
here where the advanced
drawing tools should go.

139
00:06:17.016 --> 00:06:19.626
And that's like that
window display in the store.

140
00:06:20.216 --> 00:06:21.606
It's putting them
out for you to see.

141
00:06:21.606 --> 00:06:24.026
There's no question
what's available.

142
00:06:24.756 --> 00:06:27.536
What they didn't do
is hide everything

143
00:06:27.536 --> 00:06:30.936
in an arts supply store or
tuck it in a pencil case

144
00:06:30.936 --> 00:06:33.836
that then you have to go push
open to see what's available.

145
00:06:33.836 --> 00:06:35.186
That's creating friction.

146
00:06:35.326 --> 00:06:38.356
That's expecting the
player, or your audience

147
00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:39.836
to do work, to see what's there.

148
00:06:40.386 --> 00:06:44.956
And another thing that
they didn't do is trick you

149
00:06:44.956 --> 00:06:47.106
into thinking that you
already owned all these tools.

150
00:06:47.826 --> 00:06:50.486
Because if you could see them
all but then when you tapped

151
00:06:50.486 --> 00:06:52.666
on one to use it, it
told you that you need

152
00:06:52.666 --> 00:06:55.006
to pay money just
to test out a brush?

153
00:06:55.436 --> 00:06:56.696
Well, that would
be disappointing.

154
00:06:57.056 --> 00:06:58.916
That's not a great experience.

155
00:06:58.916 --> 00:06:59.926
It's a frustrating one.

156
00:07:00.476 --> 00:07:05.016
And that's why this design
is so elegant and so great.

157
00:07:05.456 --> 00:07:07.876
It's informative
but it's not pushy.

158
00:07:07.876 --> 00:07:13.346
Now next up, let's look at that
timing I mentioned earlier,

159
00:07:13.346 --> 00:07:16.176
a totally different kind of
app, Bloomberg Businessweek.

160
00:07:16.916 --> 00:07:18.716
And this is a business
publication

161
00:07:18.716 --> 00:07:20.936
that has regular
updates, new content.

162
00:07:21.756 --> 00:07:25.366
And without a subscription, you
can still browse, read several

163
00:07:25.366 --> 00:07:27.856
of the articles,
browse all the headlines

164
00:07:27.856 --> 00:07:31.146
and the introductory sentences.

165
00:07:31.336 --> 00:07:34.696
Now if you tap on something
that requires a subscription,

166
00:07:35.806 --> 00:07:37.396
they bring up the
subscription options.

167
00:07:38.496 --> 00:07:39.606
It's like the dessert menu.

168
00:07:40.166 --> 00:07:42.466
You're interested in
reading some of their content

169
00:07:42.906 --> 00:07:47.686
so here's the information about
subscription so you can get it.

170
00:07:49.196 --> 00:07:51.776
They're presenting it right
at that perfect moment.

171
00:07:53.346 --> 00:07:56.056
They're making it easy for
you to get the subscription.

172
00:07:58.116 --> 00:08:01.206
Now, they also have this
Subscribe button down here

173
00:07:58.116 --> 00:08:01.206
Now, they also have this
Subscribe button down here

174
00:08:01.206 --> 00:08:05.066
in the corner of every
screen and that's great too.

175
00:08:05.746 --> 00:08:07.506
But having that in addition

176
00:08:07.606 --> 00:08:10.226
to the integrated message
helps them reach more people.

177
00:08:11.256 --> 00:08:13.616
So I'm not saying you
can't have a store section.

178
00:08:14.116 --> 00:08:15.936
You just don't want to
make it the only place

179
00:08:16.026 --> 00:08:18.336
that people can find
what you're offering.

180
00:08:20.706 --> 00:08:23.036
Now this also works for games.

181
00:08:23.316 --> 00:08:25.456
I don't know how many of
you have played "Smash Hit".

182
00:08:25.556 --> 00:08:29.266
It's a really fun arcade game
that involves smashing things

183
00:08:29.266 --> 00:08:33.086
as you might have guessed, very
satisfying after a long day.

184
00:08:34.056 --> 00:08:37.106
The way that it works is
that it's an arcade game

185
00:08:37.186 --> 00:08:39.046
and the more accurate you
are at smashing things,

186
00:08:39.046 --> 00:08:39.956
the further you're going to get.

187
00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:42.316
You progress through the
checkpoints unlocking them.

188
00:08:43.066 --> 00:08:46.076
And they also offer a premium
version and they've a great way

189
00:08:46.076 --> 00:08:47.686
of illustrating exactly what

190
00:08:47.686 --> 00:08:48.886
that advanced feature
does for you.

191
00:08:49.516 --> 00:08:52.056
[ Music ]

192
00:08:52.556 --> 00:08:53.316
So here we are.

193
00:08:53.316 --> 00:08:54.766
Let's start from checkpoint 2,

194
00:08:54.766 --> 00:08:56.976
maybe I can get a little
bit further this time.

195
00:08:57.516 --> 00:09:00.626
[ Music ]

196
00:08:57.516 --> 00:09:00.626
[ Music ]

197
00:09:01.126 --> 00:09:03.186
Oh, but this requires
the premium version

198
00:09:03.186 --> 00:09:03.976
and I'm not ready to buy it.

199
00:09:04.516 --> 00:09:07.696
[ Music ]

200
00:09:08.196 --> 00:09:09.626
Pretty compelling, right?

201
00:09:10.176 --> 00:09:13.006
I mean, if you had any doubt
about what that advantage is

202
00:09:13.006 --> 00:09:15.046
that they're offering,
that spells it

203
00:09:15.046 --> 00:09:16.186
out for you right away.

204
00:09:17.786 --> 00:09:19.296
Now I don't know how
many of you notice

205
00:09:19.296 --> 00:09:21.336
that there's also this
Get Premium button here

206
00:09:21.336 --> 00:09:22.126
in the corner.

207
00:09:22.746 --> 00:09:26.626
And if you did, would
you have guessed

208
00:09:26.626 --> 00:09:28.196
that that's what the
premium version meant?

209
00:09:28.826 --> 00:09:31.866
I mean, some of you might
have tapped on it to find out

210
00:09:31.866 --> 00:09:33.486
and some of you may not have.

211
00:09:34.636 --> 00:09:36.696
And they have the details
here about what you get.

212
00:09:37.646 --> 00:09:38.936
But having this in addition

213
00:09:38.936 --> 00:09:42.936
to that integrated message
is just much more effective

214
00:09:43.156 --> 00:09:46.816
at explaining what the feature
does for you and offering it

215
00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:50.966
to you at the time
that you can use it.

216
00:09:51.236 --> 00:09:54.016
Just remember, don't
be this guy.

217
00:09:54.936 --> 00:09:58.636
Nobody wants someone pushing
in your face pestering you.

218
00:09:59.756 --> 00:10:02.776
Pestering people is not going to
get the results that you want.

219
00:09:59.756 --> 00:10:02.776
Pestering people is not going to
get the results that you want.

220
00:10:03.376 --> 00:10:05.746
But thoughtful integration
of the merchandise will.

221
00:10:06.386 --> 00:10:11.916
Now another challenge is to
help people understand the value

222
00:10:11.916 --> 00:10:13.026
of what you're offering.

223
00:10:13.616 --> 00:10:16.076
And if you walked
into a clothing store,

224
00:10:16.076 --> 00:10:17.596
this is easy to figure out.

225
00:10:17.596 --> 00:10:21.256
You can touch the merchandise,
feel what the fabric feels like.

226
00:10:21.926 --> 00:10:25.076
Does it feel luxurious or
does it feel kind of cheap?

227
00:10:26.046 --> 00:10:26.846
Is it well made?

228
00:10:27.026 --> 00:10:28.186
Are the seams are falling apart?

229
00:10:29.156 --> 00:10:30.626
Most importantly,
does it fit you?

230
00:10:30.956 --> 00:10:31.656
Does it look good?

231
00:10:31.656 --> 00:10:33.026
Is it going to suit
your purposes?

232
00:10:34.686 --> 00:10:36.166
So letting people try

233
00:10:36.166 --> 00:10:39.656
out merchandise before they buy
it is a really effective way

234
00:10:39.656 --> 00:10:42.636
of helping them understand
the quality and the value

235
00:10:42.636 --> 00:10:45.256
and the utility of
what you're offering.

236
00:10:46.176 --> 00:10:48.906
I mean, you wouldn't buy
a car without taking it

237
00:10:48.906 --> 00:10:50.676
for a test drive first, right?

238
00:10:51.486 --> 00:10:52.546
It's the same principle.

239
00:10:53.266 --> 00:10:55.796
Letting people use it will
be the best way for them

240
00:10:55.796 --> 00:10:57.716
to understand how
awesome they are.

241
00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:02.466
And again, Paper by Fifty Three
does a great job with this.

242
00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:02.466
And again, Paper by Fifty Three
does a great job with this.

243
00:11:03.506 --> 00:11:05.906
In addition to providing
a lot of samples

244
00:11:05.906 --> 00:11:08.086
of what the tools
are capable of,

245
00:11:08.496 --> 00:11:10.726
they put together an
entire journal made

246
00:11:10.726 --> 00:11:13.466
by their staff showing
off the different tools

247
00:11:13.466 --> 00:11:14.456
and their capabilities.

248
00:11:14.906 --> 00:11:17.526
And then of course, they
let you use the tools,

249
00:11:17.526 --> 00:11:18.966
the basic tools for free.

250
00:11:19.976 --> 00:11:22.846
And if you haven't used
this app, I can tell you

251
00:11:22.846 --> 00:11:25.326
that the tools respond
beautifully to your finger.

252
00:11:25.906 --> 00:11:29.566
Now me telling you that
isn't nearly as effective

253
00:11:29.566 --> 00:11:33.466
as you actually using the app
and so that's why when you go

254
00:11:33.466 --> 00:11:35.376
to find out about these
advanced drawing tools,

255
00:11:35.376 --> 00:11:36.926
they let you test
them out right there.

256
00:11:38.116 --> 00:11:40.806
You've got these sketch pads
along with detailed information

257
00:11:40.806 --> 00:11:44.976
and testing them out is how
you can determine the quality

258
00:11:44.976 --> 00:11:45.776
and the utility.

259
00:11:46.196 --> 00:11:47.826
What kind of texture
do they provide?

260
00:11:48.066 --> 00:11:50.146
How do they react to your
finger when you're drawing?

261
00:11:50.836 --> 00:11:51.966
Which one is going to be right

262
00:11:51.966 --> 00:11:53.246
for what you're trying
to achieve?

263
00:11:54.506 --> 00:11:57.336
And each of those sketch
pads has drawings already

264
00:11:57.336 --> 00:11:58.206
in progress.

265
00:11:59.176 --> 00:12:01.276
It's kind of like the test
drive where they take you

266
00:11:59.176 --> 00:12:01.276
It's kind of like the test
drive where they take you

267
00:12:01.276 --> 00:12:03.816
down certain roads to show
you how well the car handles?

268
00:12:04.506 --> 00:12:07.046
Paper by Fifty Three is
setting up the sketchpads

269
00:12:07.046 --> 00:12:09.146
to show you the optimal uses

270
00:12:09.146 --> 00:12:11.376
or some suggested
uses for those tools.

271
00:12:11.836 --> 00:12:13.366
This one's great at watercolors.

272
00:12:13.366 --> 00:12:15.376
They've set up a
watercolor drawing for you

273
00:12:15.376 --> 00:12:19.286
so then you can jump in and add
on or try your own drawings.

274
00:12:20.016 --> 00:12:24.016
And it might seem obvious
to take this approach

275
00:12:24.016 --> 00:12:26.196
with drawing tools but
I promise it will work

276
00:12:26.196 --> 00:12:28.136
for almost any kind
of virtual good.

277
00:12:29.036 --> 00:12:31.746
Here's a really different
example and that's Line.

278
00:12:32.366 --> 00:12:34.256
So it's a popular messaging app.

279
00:12:34.256 --> 00:12:37.486
You can send and receive
messages for free.

280
00:12:38.436 --> 00:12:40.836
Now one of the things
that differentiates Line

281
00:12:40.896 --> 00:12:44.516
from its competitors
is the vast array

282
00:12:44.516 --> 00:12:46.476
of stickers that they offer.

283
00:12:46.916 --> 00:12:49.276
Stickers are kind of
like really crazy Emoji.

284
00:12:49.276 --> 00:12:52.386
You can include them in your
messages and send them back

285
00:12:52.386 --> 00:12:54.046
and forth to your friends.

286
00:12:54.046 --> 00:12:56.146
It gives your text
messages a whole new life.

287
00:12:57.436 --> 00:12:59.866
Now Line gives you a
very generous selection

288
00:12:59.866 --> 00:13:02.036
of these stickers for
free so you can try them

289
00:12:59.866 --> 00:13:02.036
of these stickers for
free so you can try them

290
00:13:02.036 --> 00:13:05.106
out plus the ability
to earn stickers

291
00:13:05.106 --> 00:13:06.256
without paying anything.

292
00:13:07.106 --> 00:13:09.556
So all you have to do is
add Hello Kitty as a friend

293
00:13:09.556 --> 00:13:10.986
and then you get
Hello Kitty stickers.

294
00:13:11.656 --> 00:13:13.506
And some people love
Hello Kitty stickers.

295
00:13:14.246 --> 00:13:20.156
And using them really helps you
understand how great they are.

296
00:13:21.176 --> 00:13:24.066
Now another thing that
they offer are themes.

297
00:13:24.686 --> 00:13:27.226
And when I first investigated
themes, I'll be honest,

298
00:13:27.226 --> 00:13:30.106
I had no idea what to expect
and I thought, "Oh great,

299
00:13:30.106 --> 00:13:31.106
there's some free ones.

300
00:13:31.106 --> 00:13:32.516
Let me try out the Brown Bear."

301
00:13:33.456 --> 00:13:34.786
Let's see what happens here.

302
00:13:35.376 --> 00:13:37.906
So when you choose
the Brown Bear theme,

303
00:13:37.906 --> 00:13:41.916
instead of getting the
standard UI, you get bears!

304
00:13:42.606 --> 00:13:45.236
Hurray! Everywhere,
all over the place.

305
00:13:45.406 --> 00:13:47.606
Even the tab bar
icons are bears.

306
00:13:49.116 --> 00:13:52.636
Now, sure they could have put a
description of what a theme is

307
00:13:52.636 --> 00:13:55.286
or even a screenshot but that
wouldn't have been nearly

308
00:13:55.286 --> 00:13:58.706
as effective at conveying what
happens when you use the themes.

309
00:13:59.386 --> 00:14:02.766
Giving people some free ones
to try out is the best way

310
00:13:59.386 --> 00:14:02.766
Giving people some free ones
to try out is the best way

311
00:14:02.766 --> 00:14:05.606
to really understand
what they're all about.

312
00:14:06.106 --> 00:14:09.306
And this works for publications.

313
00:14:09.596 --> 00:14:11.226
Does anyone have any
question about where

314
00:14:11.226 --> 00:14:13.676
to get the free preview
content on the screen?

315
00:14:14.056 --> 00:14:16.496
They've made it really
easy for everybody.

316
00:14:17.896 --> 00:14:21.196
"Esquire Magazine" wants
to make sure that you know

317
00:14:21.196 --> 00:14:22.476
that reading their content

318
00:14:22.556 --> 00:14:25.346
on an iPad is the best
experience possible.

319
00:14:25.746 --> 00:14:28.846
And so they give you free
content to check out.

320
00:14:28.846 --> 00:14:32.766
It's got videos, interactivity
and this is the equivalent

321
00:14:32.766 --> 00:14:36.076
to standing in line at the store
and flipping through a magazine

322
00:14:36.076 --> 00:14:38.906
or going to a comics store
and checking out the artwork.

323
00:14:38.946 --> 00:14:42.356
It helps you to really know
whether the reading experience

324
00:14:42.356 --> 00:14:44.366
is going to be good and
whether the content's going

325
00:14:44.366 --> 00:14:46.466
to be something that
you're interested in.

326
00:14:47.916 --> 00:14:50.956
And again, this also
works for games.

327
00:14:52.056 --> 00:14:53.566
Now, I'm pretty sure
that everyone

328
00:14:53.566 --> 00:14:56.556
in this room has played Candy
Crush Saga at some point

329
00:14:56.906 --> 00:14:59.506
but for the 2 of you who
haven't, it's a puzzle game.

330
00:15:00.236 --> 00:15:05.256
And they've done okay with
in-app purchases, you know.

331
00:15:05.256 --> 00:15:07.296
So what they do at the
beginning of every level is

332
00:15:07.296 --> 00:15:08.936
that they offer you
these boosters.

333
00:15:08.936 --> 00:15:13.516
And these boosters give you a
leg up on completing the task

334
00:15:13.516 --> 00:15:15.746
and they've become much
more valuable the harder the

335
00:15:15.746 --> 00:15:16.436
puzzle is.

336
00:15:17.526 --> 00:15:19.856
And if you've never used one,
you can just ignore them,

337
00:15:20.226 --> 00:15:23.316
go for that big pink play button
and you're into a puzzle game.

338
00:15:25.316 --> 00:15:28.326
So that's why they introduced
the Daily Booster Wheel.

339
00:15:29.096 --> 00:15:32.666
Every day you can come and get
one of their boosters for free.

340
00:15:33.756 --> 00:15:37.306
So there is nothing standing in
the way of you trying them out.

341
00:15:37.966 --> 00:15:39.386
And once you try them out,

342
00:15:39.386 --> 00:15:41.656
you really know what a
difference that they can make.

343
00:15:42.326 --> 00:15:46.596
So that's what I mean about
offering a test drive.

344
00:15:47.446 --> 00:15:50.066
Letting someone really
experience that merchandise,

345
00:15:50.246 --> 00:15:53.226
trying it out before they
buy it, is the best way

346
00:15:53.226 --> 00:15:57.386
to communicate the value and
the usefulness and the quality.

347
00:15:57.976 --> 00:16:01.036
And that's why it's going
to make the decision

348
00:15:57.976 --> 00:16:01.036
And that's why it's going
to make the decision

349
00:16:01.036 --> 00:16:06.056
to buy something
easier on people.

350
00:16:06.206 --> 00:16:09.186
Now, another way to reduce
the friction to buying is

351
00:16:09.186 --> 00:16:10.366
to stick with your theme.

352
00:16:11.766 --> 00:16:14.836
It's really important that
every screen in your app

353
00:16:14.836 --> 00:16:16.556
or your game is cohesive.

354
00:16:16.556 --> 00:16:18.196
And you want to carry

355
00:16:18.196 --> 00:16:20.486
that visual design
all the way through.

356
00:16:20.806 --> 00:16:22.986
That interaction model
needs to be consistent.

357
00:16:22.986 --> 00:16:26.826
And you want to put as
much effort and time

358
00:16:27.206 --> 00:16:29.866
into designing these screens
as you do anything else

359
00:16:29.866 --> 00:16:33.176
in your app or your game.

360
00:16:33.176 --> 00:16:36.806
So this is Ruzzle Adventure
and it's got hundreds of levels

361
00:16:36.806 --> 00:16:39.366
of puzzle games and all
these various theme worlds.

362
00:16:39.966 --> 00:16:43.086
You start out in the
forest and you work

363
00:16:43.086 --> 00:16:45.126
through the different
puzzles in the forest

364
00:16:45.126 --> 00:16:46.476
to get to other lands.

365
00:16:47.226 --> 00:16:51.386
Now, every aspect of the
forest looks like the forest.

366
00:16:51.826 --> 00:16:54.456
They've got -- it doesn't matter
the objective of the game.

367
00:16:54.456 --> 00:16:58.086
You can see the forest details
creeping in at every corner.

368
00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:03.446
Now there are in-app purchases
involved and in-app currency

369
00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:03.446
Now there are in-app purchases
involved and in-app currency

370
00:17:03.446 --> 00:17:06.685
which you can use to
then buy advantages

371
00:17:06.836 --> 00:17:08.935
for the different
levels, powerful boosts.

372
00:17:09.836 --> 00:17:12.476
And you can earn the in-app
currency as you're playing

373
00:17:12.846 --> 00:17:15.996
but you can also, of course,
make an in-app purchase

374
00:17:15.996 --> 00:17:17.086
for their in-app currency.

375
00:17:17.665 --> 00:17:20.506
So imagine you're up against
Chief Smartypants here

376
00:17:20.506 --> 00:17:21.506
and he's tough.

377
00:17:22.536 --> 00:17:24.996
So it might be worth
getting some in-app currency

378
00:17:25.406 --> 00:17:28.286
so that you can -- so that you
go buy some in-app currency

379
00:17:28.286 --> 00:17:31.256
so you can get some
of those boosters.

380
00:17:31.256 --> 00:17:32.786
So imagine you're excited.

381
00:17:32.786 --> 00:17:34.366
You want to beat
Chief Smartypants.

382
00:17:35.046 --> 00:17:36.726
But the next screen
you saw was this.

383
00:17:38.036 --> 00:17:39.306
It would be terrible, right?

384
00:17:40.316 --> 00:17:42.886
I mean, suddenly there's
an entirely different UI

385
00:17:42.886 --> 00:17:44.426
that you have to understand.

386
00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:46.216
You got to think about it.

387
00:17:46.216 --> 00:17:47.866
It's really sterile-looking.

388
00:17:47.916 --> 00:17:49.436
It's not very well laid out.

389
00:17:50.766 --> 00:17:52.476
It takes you right
out of the experience.

390
00:17:52.476 --> 00:17:53.816
You're not in the
forest anymore.

391
00:17:54.936 --> 00:17:56.296
And that creates friction.

392
00:17:56.726 --> 00:17:58.156
It makes you feel
more like work.

393
00:17:58.906 --> 00:18:00.786
That's making it
harder to buy something.

394
00:17:58.906 --> 00:18:00.786
That's making it
harder to buy something.

395
00:18:01.786 --> 00:18:04.996
Now thankfully, Ruzzle
Adventure does not do that.

396
00:18:05.936 --> 00:18:08.806
They have a nice forest
theme purchasing experience

397
00:18:08.806 --> 00:18:11.656
and all the visual design
and interaction is consistent

398
00:18:12.146 --> 00:18:14.686
with everything else
in the game.

399
00:18:15.936 --> 00:18:19.436
So make sure that you
maintain the world of your game

400
00:18:19.436 --> 00:18:22.226
or the look of your app
on every single screen

401
00:18:22.226 --> 00:18:23.956
and with every single control.

402
00:18:24.906 --> 00:18:27.436
Because when you suddenly
snatch people out of that world

403
00:18:28.596 --> 00:18:31.246
and they have to deal with a
new interface or a new look,

404
00:18:31.346 --> 00:18:32.596
it's going to feel like work.

405
00:18:32.716 --> 00:18:34.196
It's going to be hard.

406
00:18:34.696 --> 00:18:36.696
And buying, we want
it to be easy, right?

407
00:18:37.736 --> 00:18:41.676
Now just a word of warning
while you are busy sticking

408
00:18:41.676 --> 00:18:44.156
with your theme,
don't take it so far

409
00:18:44.156 --> 00:18:46.046
that language becomes confusing.

410
00:18:46.956 --> 00:18:47.666
You want to make sure

411
00:18:47.666 --> 00:18:50.176
that people can really
understand exactly what they're

412
00:18:50.176 --> 00:18:51.336
going to be getting
for their money.

413
00:18:51.856 --> 00:18:53.066
You use clear language.

414
00:18:54.506 --> 00:18:57.226
Now have you guys ever seen a
description for an apartment

415
00:18:57.226 --> 00:19:00.046
or house that said something
like "needs a little work"?

416
00:18:57.226 --> 00:19:00.046
or house that said something
like "needs a little work"?

417
00:19:01.126 --> 00:19:02.836
And then you show up
and it's, you know,

418
00:19:03.066 --> 00:19:03.876
it looks more like this.

419
00:19:04.166 --> 00:19:07.436
I think we've all
had that experience.

420
00:19:07.806 --> 00:19:11.696
Now with any purchase, it's
so important to be honest.

421
00:19:11.946 --> 00:19:14.826
There is really a fine line
between trying to be positive

422
00:19:14.826 --> 00:19:16.746
about something,
highlighting the features

423
00:19:16.836 --> 00:19:19.076
and really being
overly optimistic

424
00:19:19.076 --> 00:19:20.156
about what you're selling.

425
00:19:20.646 --> 00:19:23.666
Nobody wants to be disappointed

426
00:19:23.776 --> 00:19:26.636
when they see what the
merchandise actually is.

427
00:19:27.146 --> 00:19:30.306
And especially when you're
coming to subscriptions

428
00:19:30.306 --> 00:19:34.396
or recurring content, you want
to be as specific as possible.

429
00:19:35.176 --> 00:19:37.206
Set people's expectations
correctly.

430
00:19:37.426 --> 00:19:39.956
When are they going
to get new content?

431
00:19:40.406 --> 00:19:42.216
How much content are they
getting for the price?

432
00:19:42.946 --> 00:19:46.436
And if you just saw something
like this, you don't know.

433
00:19:46.436 --> 00:19:48.896
Is it expensive or
is it a bargain?

434
00:19:50.056 --> 00:19:52.026
I mean, if it's 12
issues in a year,

435
00:19:52.026 --> 00:19:53.566
that's less than
a dollar an issue.

436
00:19:54.356 --> 00:19:55.946
That's pretty reasonable, right?

437
00:19:55.946 --> 00:19:59.596
But if it's only two
issues, well, I don't know.

438
00:20:00.096 --> 00:20:03.116
Is that content really
worth that much money to me

439
00:20:03.116 --> 00:20:05.566
and see now, I'm off
thinking about whether

440
00:20:05.566 --> 00:20:08.146
or not this is a purchase
I want to make instead

441
00:20:08.146 --> 00:20:11.466
of quickly coming to a decision,
getting the new content

442
00:20:11.466 --> 00:20:12.766
and going off to enjoy it

443
00:20:12.906 --> 00:20:14.816
because that's what I've
come to an app to do.

444
00:20:15.006 --> 00:20:16.756
I've come to enjoy content.

445
00:20:17.266 --> 00:20:19.226
I've come to an app to
help me achieve something.

446
00:20:21.066 --> 00:20:23.296
Jamie Oliver does a much
better job with this.

447
00:20:23.296 --> 00:20:27.456
He's a famous chef and
he has a recipes app.

448
00:20:27.906 --> 00:20:30.646
And you'll see here that
here they let you know

449
00:20:30.646 --> 00:20:32.206
that new content is coming

450
00:20:32.206 --> 00:20:35.286
on the second Wednesday
of every month.

451
00:20:35.916 --> 00:20:38.156
Crystal clear, very specific.

452
00:20:38.336 --> 00:20:41.456
I know exactly when
to expect things.

453
00:20:42.776 --> 00:20:45.926
FitStar is a personal
training application

454
00:20:46.416 --> 00:20:49.536
and they have a number of
workouts and they're tailored

455
00:20:49.636 --> 00:20:53.366
to your goals and also
your actual performance.

456
00:20:54.226 --> 00:20:57.856
Now their subscription screen
gives you detailed outlines

457
00:20:57.856 --> 00:20:58.746
of all the programs.

458
00:20:59.506 --> 00:21:02.276
I mean, you can find out
the length of the workouts.

459
00:20:59.506 --> 00:21:02.276
I mean, you can find out
the length of the workouts.

460
00:21:02.346 --> 00:21:03.396
Do you want something short?

461
00:21:03.436 --> 00:21:04.536
Do you want something long?

462
00:21:04.796 --> 00:21:08.956
They are offering both of
those, the advantages of them.

463
00:21:08.956 --> 00:21:11.596
Are you interested in fat
burning or are you trying

464
00:21:11.596 --> 00:21:12.556
to do strength training?

465
00:21:13.776 --> 00:21:17.126
They've even pointed out which
one is recommended for me based

466
00:21:17.126 --> 00:21:18.946
on a couple of questions
I answered earlier.

467
00:21:19.506 --> 00:21:23.186
And when you're ready to
buy that subscription,

468
00:21:24.416 --> 00:21:27.486
that screen is so clear about
exactly what you're going

469
00:21:27.486 --> 00:21:29.606
to be getting, all
of the programs,

470
00:21:29.796 --> 00:21:31.346
unlimited free style moves.

471
00:21:32.146 --> 00:21:34.546
And they've even highlighted
the annual subscription

472
00:21:34.936 --> 00:21:37.206
with a discount.

473
00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:40.356
They've made it so easy
just through the use

474
00:21:40.356 --> 00:21:42.956
of clear language for
me to make a decision

475
00:21:42.956 --> 00:21:44.046
about buying something.

476
00:21:45.046 --> 00:21:47.446
And now I really understand
what I'm getting for my money

477
00:21:47.486 --> 00:21:49.386
and I can appreciate it.

478
00:21:49.946 --> 00:21:53.346
Now another way that
you can make this clear

479
00:21:53.346 --> 00:21:56.876
to your audience is to
do the math for them.

480
00:21:57.106 --> 00:21:58.766
I don't like doing math.

481
00:21:59.046 --> 00:22:00.036
That's not fun for me.

482
00:21:59.046 --> 00:22:00.036
That's not fun for me.

483
00:22:00.246 --> 00:22:01.176
Don't make me do the math.

484
00:22:01.946 --> 00:22:04.866
It's your job as the app
developer to make it easy

485
00:22:04.866 --> 00:22:06.196
on people to make a decision.

486
00:22:07.126 --> 00:22:10.016
So quick, which one of
these is the best value?

487
00:22:11.116 --> 00:22:14.456
I mean, I'm sure some of you can
really quickly calculate this

488
00:22:14.456 --> 00:22:16.226
but most people are
not going to want to.

489
00:22:16.796 --> 00:22:18.016
It's this one, by the way.

490
00:22:18.996 --> 00:22:22.966
And so that's why you really
want to help people understand

491
00:22:22.966 --> 00:22:26.266
which is going to be the
most cost effective for them.

492
00:22:26.776 --> 00:22:27.916
This is Lovoo.

493
00:22:27.916 --> 00:22:31.406
It's a dating application and
they offer tons of utility

494
00:22:31.406 --> 00:22:32.766
without a subscription.

495
00:22:32.766 --> 00:22:36.636
You can fill out a
profile, message users.

496
00:22:36.636 --> 00:22:39.126
There's lots of ways to
browse potential suitors,

497
00:22:39.536 --> 00:22:40.076
including this.

498
00:22:40.076 --> 00:22:41.216
This is a radar screen.

499
00:22:41.216 --> 00:22:42.276
That's what you're seeing here.

500
00:22:42.336 --> 00:22:46.256
You can see all the people,
all potential dates around me.

501
00:22:46.796 --> 00:22:50.876
And of course, they have some
premium features that'll help

502
00:22:50.876 --> 00:22:52.356
you get more exposure to people.

503
00:22:53.196 --> 00:22:57.286
And here is how they explain
the subscription options.

504
00:22:57.776 --> 00:23:01.956
It's called pennies
a day to find love.

505
00:22:57.776 --> 00:23:01.956
It's called pennies
a day to find love.

506
00:23:02.446 --> 00:23:04.116
Pennies a day to find love!

507
00:23:04.666 --> 00:23:06.826
Who can afford pennies
a day for love?

508
00:23:08.026 --> 00:23:09.856
Now, there's no guesswork here.

509
00:23:09.856 --> 00:23:12.696
I know exactly which
subscription is going

510
00:23:12.696 --> 00:23:14.496
to be the lowest cost per day.

511
00:23:14.806 --> 00:23:15.916
But it's really important.

512
00:23:15.916 --> 00:23:17.756
If you're going to
take it to this level,

513
00:23:18.506 --> 00:23:19.846
make sure that you're
still calling

514
00:23:19.846 --> 00:23:22.286
out the total purchase
price because again,

515
00:23:22.286 --> 00:23:24.826
we want to be honest and
clear with our language.

516
00:23:25.306 --> 00:23:28.016
People are going to want to
know what they expect to pay.

517
00:23:28.286 --> 00:23:30.256
Don't make them do the
math in reverse, right?

518
00:23:30.256 --> 00:23:34.796
Now, if your app is available
worldwide, I want to make sure

519
00:23:34.796 --> 00:23:36.516
that you localize your currency

520
00:23:36.836 --> 00:23:38.776
because that's a huge
roadblock if you don't.

521
00:23:39.386 --> 00:23:44.456
So that's what I mean about
doing the math for people.

522
00:23:44.596 --> 00:23:49.746
It can be so helpful in
making that decision quickly.

523
00:23:50.576 --> 00:23:53.816
Now, another thing that's really
helpful is showing fewer things.

524
00:23:54.336 --> 00:23:57.176
It's about quality,
not about quantity.

525
00:23:57.856 --> 00:24:00.806
Too many choices, you
risk overwhelming people.

526
00:23:57.856 --> 00:24:00.806
Too many choices, you
risk overwhelming people.

527
00:24:01.306 --> 00:24:03.236
And I don't know how
many of you have heard

528
00:24:03.236 --> 00:24:04.866
of the paradox of choice.

529
00:24:05.056 --> 00:24:08.176
It essentially means that the
more choices that you have,

530
00:24:08.556 --> 00:24:10.236
the harder it is
to make a decision.

531
00:24:10.236 --> 00:24:13.666
And in fact, when
you've too many choices,

532
00:24:13.666 --> 00:24:16.506
that choice overload,
it stresses you out.

533
00:24:16.726 --> 00:24:17.816
And what you, people wind

534
00:24:17.816 --> 00:24:20.276
up doing is avoiding making
a decision altogether.

535
00:24:21.016 --> 00:24:24.236
And you want people to make a
decision to purchase something.

536
00:24:24.796 --> 00:24:29.026
It's kind of like if you've
ever gone on to make a recipe

537
00:24:29.026 --> 00:24:30.916
and it calls for apples.

538
00:24:31.316 --> 00:24:34.326
Maybe you're making apple
pie and so you got your list.

539
00:24:34.326 --> 00:24:36.786
You go to the grocery store and
then you're faced with this.

540
00:24:37.856 --> 00:24:39.056
Well, what kind of apples?

541
00:24:39.056 --> 00:24:42.806
Is it Golden Delicious
or Red Delicious

542
00:24:42.806 --> 00:24:45.346
or Fuji or Pink Lady or oh!

543
00:24:45.856 --> 00:24:46.536
It's too much!

544
00:24:46.806 --> 00:24:47.756
It's overwhelming!

545
00:24:48.016 --> 00:24:49.196
Too many apples!

546
00:24:49.746 --> 00:24:53.006
And this will result in you just
abandoning that pie altogether.

547
00:24:53.006 --> 00:24:56.736
You want to avoid that
reaction in your app.

548
00:24:57.616 --> 00:25:01.076
Too many choices becomes
stressful and that's going

549
00:24:57.616 --> 00:25:01.076
Too many choices becomes
stressful and that's going

550
00:25:01.076 --> 00:25:04.396
to result in people avoiding the
purchase decision altogether.

551
00:25:04.986 --> 00:25:07.206
So here is Match.

552
00:25:07.926 --> 00:25:09.976
It's a different
dating application.

553
00:25:10.176 --> 00:25:12.996
Again, loads of utility
without subscription.

554
00:25:13.546 --> 00:25:15.696
More than letting you
test-drive the app.

555
00:25:15.696 --> 00:25:17.876
They're practically
giving you an entire car.

556
00:25:18.326 --> 00:25:21.436
You can fill out your profile,
message people, a million ways

557
00:25:21.436 --> 00:25:23.826
of browsing including
recommended partners.

558
00:25:24.726 --> 00:25:28.466
They do offer some premium
features though and one

559
00:25:28.466 --> 00:25:30.676
of the things is
seeing who's viewed me.

560
00:25:31.316 --> 00:25:34.366
So tapping on that
viewed me button brings

561
00:25:34.366 --> 00:25:35.836
up their subscription choices.

562
00:25:36.406 --> 00:25:38.016
So they're offering
me that information

563
00:25:38.016 --> 00:25:40.206
at the time that I need it.

564
00:25:40.436 --> 00:25:43.236
Now look, I've got
3 easy choices here.

565
00:25:43.866 --> 00:25:48.016
They've even highlighted
the one with the best value.

566
00:25:48.016 --> 00:25:50.506
3 choices is an easy
decision to make.

567
00:25:51.246 --> 00:25:55.496
I don't have to scroll through
a long list of options or page

568
00:25:55.496 --> 00:25:56.926
through screen after screen

569
00:25:56.926 --> 00:25:58.786
with different subscription
numbers on it.

570
00:25:59.156 --> 00:26:00.696
Then I have to remember
them in my head

571
00:25:59.156 --> 00:26:00.696
Then I have to remember
them in my head

572
00:26:00.696 --> 00:26:01.856
and try and figure it out.

573
00:26:01.856 --> 00:26:02.806
That makes it hard.

574
00:26:04.036 --> 00:26:06.056
Buying things shouldn't be hard.

575
00:26:06.686 --> 00:26:11.626
So fewer things all on one
screen, no paging, no scrolling.

576
00:26:12.446 --> 00:26:18.066
People want to be able to see
all their options at once.

577
00:26:19.386 --> 00:26:23.046
Now, if someone's ready to
make that decision to buy,

578
00:26:23.046 --> 00:26:25.736
they're ready to press that
buy button, you really want

579
00:26:25.736 --> 00:26:28.386
to execute on it as
efficiently as possible.

580
00:26:28.946 --> 00:26:31.236
I mean, have you ever gone
to get a cup of coffee

581
00:26:31.236 --> 00:26:34.436
and then you're faced with
a long, slow-moving line?

582
00:26:34.436 --> 00:26:36.066
And so, you're just
like, "Forget it."

583
00:26:37.346 --> 00:26:40.216
That's what you don't want to
happen in your app or game.

584
00:26:41.206 --> 00:26:44.946
Minimizing both the time and the
number of steps that it takes

585
00:26:45.206 --> 00:26:48.666
to make a purchase keeps people
really engaged in your app,

586
00:26:48.666 --> 00:26:50.786
not thinking about that
purchasing process.

587
00:26:51.496 --> 00:26:55.106
So this is Supernauts.

588
00:26:55.106 --> 00:26:58.426
It's a builder game that
takes place in space.

589
00:26:58.976 --> 00:27:02.006
It's not quite out worldwide
yet so stayed tuned very soon

590
00:26:58.976 --> 00:27:02.006
It's not quite out worldwide
yet so stayed tuned very soon

591
00:27:02.006 --> 00:27:03.756
because you're probably going
to want to play it after this.

592
00:27:05.006 --> 00:27:06.336
Now right now, I'm
in the process

593
00:27:06.336 --> 00:27:08.216
of repairing my tiki hut.

594
00:27:08.216 --> 00:27:10.866
As you can see, it's a little
pathetic at the moment.

595
00:27:11.546 --> 00:27:14.306
I want to add some more
timber but this is going

596
00:27:14.306 --> 00:27:17.106
to cost me 8 diamonds.

597
00:27:18.046 --> 00:27:20.596
Now, I only have 1.

598
00:27:21.506 --> 00:27:24.816
So what happens when I
press that green button?

599
00:27:25.376 --> 00:27:28.106
I can get some gems right here.

600
00:27:28.206 --> 00:27:29.636
I don't have to go anywhere.

601
00:27:30.336 --> 00:27:34.656
I can stay right in that
moment of tiki hut repair.

602
00:27:35.686 --> 00:27:38.486
So in addition to clearly
stating what I'm going to get,

603
00:27:38.926 --> 00:27:43.616
200 gems for $4.99, they're also
reminding me why I'm seeing this

604
00:27:43.616 --> 00:27:44.466
in the first place.

605
00:27:45.586 --> 00:27:46.736
I need 7 more.

606
00:27:46.736 --> 00:27:47.446
I only have 1.

607
00:27:47.446 --> 00:27:48.076
I needed 8.

608
00:27:49.156 --> 00:27:50.706
And they've even
selected the package

609
00:27:50.706 --> 00:27:53.036
of gems that's closest
to what I needed.

610
00:27:54.076 --> 00:27:56.886
It happens that this is the
smallest package of gems

611
00:27:56.936 --> 00:27:58.926
but then I can make a
decision really quickly.

612
00:27:59.256 --> 00:28:02.066
I mean, yes, they have
a gem store and yes,

613
00:27:59.256 --> 00:28:02.066
I mean, yes, they have
a gem store and yes,

614
00:28:02.066 --> 00:28:03.986
it has many more options in it.

615
00:28:04.876 --> 00:28:08.406
But taking me away from my
tiki hut is more disruptive

616
00:28:08.406 --> 00:28:11.926
than letting me just stay
put, stay focused on building

617
00:28:12.396 --> 00:28:14.406
because building is
what I came here to do.

618
00:28:15.596 --> 00:28:17.716
You never want to
distract a game player

619
00:28:17.716 --> 00:28:18.966
from playing the game.

620
00:28:19.456 --> 00:28:20.476
That's the fun part.

621
00:28:20.956 --> 00:28:23.116
Distracting them makes
it easier for them

622
00:28:23.116 --> 00:28:24.486
to just walk away entirely.

623
00:28:26.256 --> 00:28:30.406
Similarly, Candy Crush Saga
handles this really well also.

624
00:28:31.446 --> 00:28:34.286
You have those boosters at
the beginning of every level

625
00:28:35.126 --> 00:28:37.746
and you have the option of
purchasing them right here.

626
00:28:38.396 --> 00:28:40.706
They're not shipping
me off to a candy store

627
00:28:40.706 --> 00:28:42.736
with a million different
things to choose from.

628
00:28:42.986 --> 00:28:44.936
It's just, "Would you
like this booster?

629
00:28:44.936 --> 00:28:45.796
Here's the price.

630
00:28:45.926 --> 00:28:47.246
Buy it. Back in the game."

631
00:28:47.586 --> 00:28:52.536
Fast and efficient, right at
the moment when I can use it.

632
00:28:53.106 --> 00:28:56.916
Now another thing to think about
is preloading images and data

633
00:28:56.916 --> 00:28:58.276
so it's there when
people need it.

634
00:28:58.896 --> 00:29:00.416
This is the Bejeweled Blitz.

635
00:28:58.896 --> 00:29:00.416
This is the Bejeweled Blitz.

636
00:29:00.416 --> 00:29:02.726
It's another kind of
match-3 puzzle game.

637
00:29:03.346 --> 00:29:05.276
Now you earn coins
as you're playing

638
00:29:05.336 --> 00:29:07.636
and then you use the
coins to buy rare gems

639
00:29:07.706 --> 00:29:10.746
which then help you to do
better on the various puzzles.

640
00:29:11.766 --> 00:29:13.976
Now every day, you can
also get some free coins

641
00:29:14.426 --> 00:29:15.876
from this daily wheel.

642
00:29:16.506 --> 00:29:20.466
Now you get 1 free spin
per day but of course,

643
00:29:20.466 --> 00:29:23.476
you can buy some more
spins, if you like.

644
00:29:23.646 --> 00:29:25.706
And the wheel's pretty generous.

645
00:29:26.196 --> 00:29:27.626
So imagine that you're excited

646
00:29:27.626 --> 00:29:29.006
and you're like,
"Okay, you know what?

647
00:29:29.006 --> 00:29:31.016
I'm doing really good on
the tournament this week.

648
00:29:31.016 --> 00:29:32.286
I want to beat my friends.

649
00:29:32.836 --> 00:29:35.206
Let me go get some more
spins and see what happens."

650
00:29:35.666 --> 00:29:38.126
Well, what if you're
faced with this?

651
00:29:39.116 --> 00:29:40.566
People don't like waiting.

652
00:29:40.566 --> 00:29:42.516
That's like that long
line at the coffee store.

653
00:29:43.206 --> 00:29:44.946
You risk them not
sticking around.

654
00:29:46.336 --> 00:29:50.006
Now thankfully, Bejeweled
Blitz doesn't do this.

655
00:29:50.276 --> 00:29:51.716
They load everything
immediately.

656
00:29:53.106 --> 00:29:56.206
What you want to do is to be
aware of what people are likely

657
00:29:56.206 --> 00:29:58.976
to purchase based on where
they are in your app or game.

658
00:29:59.656 --> 00:30:02.776
And then you can look for times
to thoughtfully preload it

659
00:29:59.656 --> 00:30:02.776
And then you can look for times
to thoughtfully preload it

660
00:30:03.186 --> 00:30:06.076
so that the data and the images
are available should someone

661
00:30:06.076 --> 00:30:07.036
need it.

662
00:30:07.326 --> 00:30:09.516
So this screen is
only accessible

663
00:30:09.966 --> 00:30:11.136
from that wheel screen.

664
00:30:11.426 --> 00:30:14.326
So this is a perfect opportunity
to preload those images

665
00:30:14.706 --> 00:30:15.796
so then they'll be available.

666
00:30:15.796 --> 00:30:20.056
The images and data will be
there when people seek it out.

667
00:30:20.266 --> 00:30:24.536
And 1 final tip is you should
cache artwork appropriately

668
00:30:25.016 --> 00:30:27.286
so it's not going to have
to load every single time

669
00:30:27.286 --> 00:30:28.886
if it doesn't need to.

670
00:30:29.286 --> 00:30:32.206
Now after lunch in this
room, we have a great session

671
00:30:32.506 --> 00:30:35.466
about optimizing in-app
purchases with StoreKit

672
00:30:35.676 --> 00:30:39.256
so I highly recommend you come
back after lunch and check it

673
00:30:39.256 --> 00:30:41.356
out because there's
a lot of great tips

674
00:30:41.396 --> 00:30:43.476
for avoiding common pitfalls.

675
00:30:45.916 --> 00:30:49.296
Now finally, what you can do to
make the buying process easier

676
00:30:49.296 --> 00:30:51.446
on people is to inspire people.

677
00:30:52.916 --> 00:30:54.206
Someone may not want something

678
00:30:54.206 --> 00:30:56.846
because they don't know what
the possibility of it is.

679
00:30:57.136 --> 00:31:00.036
They don't understand how a tool
or a feature could help them

680
00:30:57.136 --> 00:31:00.036
They don't understand how a tool
or a feature could help them

681
00:31:01.116 --> 00:31:05.236
or what they could
achieve with them.

682
00:31:05.456 --> 00:31:08.126
Now, I'm not saying that
you want to turn everything

683
00:31:08.126 --> 00:31:09.736
into an advertising experience.

684
00:31:09.736 --> 00:31:11.286
Again, we're not
trying to be pushy.

685
00:31:11.606 --> 00:31:12.506
But there's a lot of ways

686
00:31:12.506 --> 00:31:16.686
that you can really naturally
illustrate how things can

687
00:31:16.686 --> 00:31:18.636
be used.

688
00:31:19.196 --> 00:31:21.836
Paper by Fifty Three
does this beautifully.

689
00:31:22.856 --> 00:31:25.606
They've got this sample
journal that the staff has made

690
00:31:25.606 --> 00:31:28.506
that shows off not only what
the tools are capable of

691
00:31:28.876 --> 00:31:30.986
but also different ways
they could be used.

692
00:31:31.636 --> 00:31:34.616
You know, maybe you
want a wireframe with it

693
00:31:34.616 --> 00:31:36.496
or maybe you want to
make some artwork.

694
00:31:37.396 --> 00:31:41.726
Now another thing they do
well is give suggestive titles

695
00:31:41.726 --> 00:31:42.646
to the blank journals.

696
00:31:43.706 --> 00:31:46.786
Maybe you hadn't considered
sketching or journaling

697
00:31:46.786 --> 00:31:48.396
with this app but
now you're going to.

698
00:31:48.396 --> 00:31:52.646
And they also have a
gallery of artwork created

699
00:31:52.646 --> 00:31:55.176
by people using the
app, regular people.

700
00:31:55.546 --> 00:31:58.306
And this gallery
shows off the variety

701
00:31:58.306 --> 00:32:02.146
of styles that's achievable,
what you can do with the tools

702
00:31:58.306 --> 00:32:02.146
of styles that's achievable,
what you can do with the tools

703
00:32:02.876 --> 00:32:05.336
and also how the
app can be used.

704
00:32:05.336 --> 00:32:09.116
I mean, you can make
some amazing artwork

705
00:32:09.116 --> 00:32:11.786
but you also might want to use
it for architectural renderings.

706
00:32:12.306 --> 00:32:16.686
And if that doesn't get you
inspired, maybe the idea

707
00:32:16.686 --> 00:32:19.516
of having your work featured
here is very exciting.

708
00:32:20.206 --> 00:32:24.026
So you've just got a plethora
of ways that you can use the app

709
00:32:24.026 --> 00:32:26.616
and see what the
tools are capable of.

710
00:32:27.846 --> 00:32:32.516
Now again, with games, and with
Supernauts does this very well,

711
00:32:33.576 --> 00:32:35.846
it's kind of a different
approach with the same idea.

712
00:32:36.796 --> 00:32:40.016
So after you learn the basic
game play with Supernauts,

713
00:32:40.306 --> 00:32:43.546
they reward you for visiting
other people's worlds.

714
00:32:44.206 --> 00:32:46.456
Now like I said, this is a
builder game so you're working

715
00:32:46.456 --> 00:32:48.526
on building up your property.

716
00:32:49.336 --> 00:32:52.046
And seeing how creative other
people have been is super

717
00:32:52.046 --> 00:32:53.996
inspiring for your own place.

718
00:32:55.446 --> 00:32:57.756
Now this is how you
start off, pretty basic.

719
00:32:57.836 --> 00:32:59.866
In the first 15 minutes,
you're going

720
00:32:59.866 --> 00:33:01.796
to get some real basic
structures going.

721
00:32:59.866 --> 00:33:01.796
to get some real basic
structures going.

722
00:33:02.706 --> 00:33:04.886
And after a couple of hours,
you might wind up with something

723
00:33:04.886 --> 00:33:09.096
like this or something
like my tiki hut.

724
00:33:09.096 --> 00:33:12.046
And when you get through a
couple of hours, you think,

725
00:33:12.046 --> 00:33:13.206
"Okay, I know what's going on.

726
00:33:13.776 --> 00:33:15.306
I have an idea of
what's possible."

727
00:33:15.856 --> 00:33:17.696
But it's only when you go

728
00:33:17.696 --> 00:33:21.146
to visit other people's worlds
do you really get a sense

729
00:33:21.716 --> 00:33:24.276
for what's coming, for
what can be created.

730
00:33:27.406 --> 00:33:28.846
So check these out.

731
00:33:28.846 --> 00:33:30.336
These are all real players.

732
00:33:31.056 --> 00:33:34.686
This is not the Supernauts
crew who created these.

733
00:33:35.756 --> 00:33:37.006
Amazing, right?

734
00:33:37.236 --> 00:33:40.976
I mean, my tiki hut is
super lame by comparison.

735
00:33:41.516 --> 00:33:44.566
[ Laughter ]

736
00:33:45.066 --> 00:33:46.936
And now I'm excited.

737
00:33:46.936 --> 00:33:51.726
Now I want to go in and add a
dragon or you know, a rainbow

738
00:33:51.726 --> 00:33:54.216
or a flag or messages
to my friends.

739
00:33:54.256 --> 00:33:55.836
I mean, it makes,
it gets you excited

740
00:33:55.836 --> 00:33:57.856
about spending more
time building things.

741
00:33:58.206 --> 00:33:59.386
You make something really cool

742
00:33:59.386 --> 00:34:02.106
and you can see what materials
are still forthcoming.

743
00:33:59.386 --> 00:34:02.106
and you can see what materials
are still forthcoming.

744
00:34:02.666 --> 00:34:07.146
So as you're thinking about how

745
00:34:07.146 --> 00:34:09.646
to make the buying
process easier,

746
00:34:10.795 --> 00:34:14.376
make sure that people can see
what's available with no effort.

747
00:34:14.876 --> 00:34:18.686
Help people understand the
value of what you're offering.

748
00:34:18.876 --> 00:34:20.735
Give them that test
drive experience.

749
00:34:21.926 --> 00:34:24.556
And then when it comes
to the transaction,

750
00:34:24.556 --> 00:34:29.286
make sure that you can process
on it fast and efficient.

751
00:34:29.286 --> 00:34:31.636
And don't forget to
get people excited

752
00:34:31.636 --> 00:34:32.696
about what you're offering.

753
00:34:33.226 --> 00:34:36.065
But the story doesn't end here.

754
00:34:36.326 --> 00:34:37.886
Your job is not over
just getting them

755
00:34:37.886 --> 00:34:39.076
to push the buy button.

756
00:34:39.466 --> 00:34:41.266
There's a lot of things
that need to happen

757
00:34:41.396 --> 00:34:44.716
to complete the transaction
in order to have it continue

758
00:34:44.716 --> 00:34:46.505
to be a really great experience.

759
00:34:47.856 --> 00:34:51.916
The first of which is a new
feature coming in the fall

760
00:34:51.996 --> 00:34:54.235
and Tim touched on
this very briefly,

761
00:34:54.556 --> 00:34:57.045
but I'd like to spend a little
more time because this is going

762
00:34:57.045 --> 00:35:01.126
to impact everyone
and that's Ask to Buy.

763
00:34:57.045 --> 00:35:01.126
to impact everyone
and that's Ask to Buy.

764
00:35:01.126 --> 00:35:05.186
So in the fall, you'll be able
to associate up to 6 people

765
00:35:05.186 --> 00:35:06.556
in the household as a family.

766
00:35:07.176 --> 00:35:08.666
And as part of this, we're going

767
00:35:08.666 --> 00:35:10.986
to have a new parental
control called Ask to Buy.

768
00:35:11.826 --> 00:35:14.556
And if it's enabled, this
means that a parent is going

769
00:35:14.556 --> 00:35:18.076
to approve or decline any
purchases that a child makes.

770
00:35:19.036 --> 00:35:20.836
So it's basically the
equivalent of this.

771
00:35:22.296 --> 00:35:23.046
"Can I have it?

772
00:35:23.046 --> 00:35:24.166
Please, please, please?"

773
00:35:24.946 --> 00:35:27.306
But it's all going to
happen through your devices.

774
00:35:28.256 --> 00:35:29.386
So here's how it works.

775
00:35:30.106 --> 00:35:34.606
Today, when your app sends a
request to purchase something,

776
00:35:35.756 --> 00:35:37.986
you're going to get a
response right back.

777
00:35:38.836 --> 00:35:40.456
That purchased or failed.

778
00:35:40.456 --> 00:35:46.686
Now with Ask to Buy, we're going
to check with the parent first

779
00:35:46.686 --> 00:35:48.036
if Ask to Buy is enabled.

780
00:35:48.036 --> 00:35:50.156
So you're going to send
the request for purchasing.

781
00:35:50.616 --> 00:35:51.916
The child's going to
ask for something.

782
00:35:51.916 --> 00:35:54.336
And then the App Store is
going to check with the parent.

783
00:35:55.196 --> 00:35:56.356
So what does that mean to you?

784
00:35:57.986 --> 00:35:59.926
During this time, you're going

785
00:35:59.926 --> 00:36:01.966
to get a response
back of deferred.

786
00:35:59.926 --> 00:36:01.966
to get a response
back of deferred.

787
00:36:02.466 --> 00:36:08.216
And then once the parent
accepts or declines the request,

788
00:36:09.246 --> 00:36:11.686
that's when the App Store will
let you know whether it's been

789
00:36:11.686 --> 00:36:12.686
purchased or failed.

790
00:36:13.976 --> 00:36:18.636
And this deferred state can last
for up to 24 hours while waiting

791
00:36:18.636 --> 00:36:19.916
for a response from the parent.

792
00:36:20.206 --> 00:36:22.816
And if there's no
response within 24 hours,

793
00:36:22.816 --> 00:36:25.886
it's going to default to failed
and the child can request again.

794
00:36:27.156 --> 00:36:29.876
So what does this mean
from a design perspective?

795
00:36:30.976 --> 00:36:34.046
Well, if you have
modal situations

796
00:36:34.256 --> 00:36:37.206
where people are doing
purchasing, you need to shift

797
00:36:37.206 --> 00:36:39.226
over to an asynchronous model.

798
00:36:39.786 --> 00:36:43.566
Let's say your game offers
boosters at the beginning

799
00:36:43.566 --> 00:36:46.156
of a level and a child
makes a request to buy one.

800
00:36:46.716 --> 00:36:50.516
You don't want that child stuck
there waiting for up to 24 hours

801
00:36:50.516 --> 00:36:52.616
to hear whether they
can have a booster

802
00:36:52.616 --> 00:36:53.786
for the next level, right?

803
00:36:54.116 --> 00:36:56.486
I can guarantee you, they're not
going to stick around that long.

804
00:36:57.746 --> 00:36:59.206
So what can you do?

805
00:36:59.206 --> 00:37:02.156
Well, you have to figure
what's going to be best

806
00:36:59.206 --> 00:37:02.156
Well, you have to figure
what's going to be best

807
00:37:02.156 --> 00:37:03.766
for your app or your game.

808
00:37:04.096 --> 00:37:07.036
The important thing is that
you let people keep using

809
00:37:07.036 --> 00:37:08.926
and enjoying your
app during this time.

810
00:37:09.636 --> 00:37:11.876
So if a child's requested
a booster,

811
00:37:11.876 --> 00:37:14.746
well you send the request
off for the parent to approve

812
00:37:15.146 --> 00:37:17.406
but then you could let
them play other levels

813
00:37:17.446 --> 00:37:19.466
or maybe they continue
playing the level

814
00:37:20.046 --> 00:37:22.746
but without the booster and
when that approval comes in,

815
00:37:22.746 --> 00:37:25.536
you bank it and let them
use it at a different time.

816
00:37:26.676 --> 00:37:29.746
Another thing that you want to
think about is giving some sort

817
00:37:29.746 --> 00:37:32.116
of feedback inside
of the application

818
00:37:32.466 --> 00:37:35.506
so that the child remembers
that something is pending,

819
00:37:35.636 --> 00:37:37.466
that they've already
asked Mom and Dad.

820
00:37:38.326 --> 00:37:41.846
And so that you could update
the label on the button

821
00:37:41.846 --> 00:37:46.426
to say something else or in the
App Store, we show a message

822
00:37:46.476 --> 00:37:48.926
to help the child remember
that it's actually pending.

823
00:37:50.036 --> 00:37:53.266
So if any people using
your app are under 18,

824
00:37:53.686 --> 00:37:55.956
you need to start
preparing for this now.

825
00:37:56.926 --> 00:37:59.676
That deferred state is
entirely new and you need

826
00:37:59.676 --> 00:38:01.416
to make sure you're
handling it well.

827
00:37:59.676 --> 00:38:01.416
to make sure you're
handling it well.

828
00:38:01.796 --> 00:38:05.156
Make sure people can still
continue to use your app

829
00:38:05.206 --> 00:38:07.906
or your game while that
deferred state is happening.

830
00:38:08.446 --> 00:38:14.436
And you want to make sure
that if a response is pending,

831
00:38:14.436 --> 00:38:15.906
that they have some
feedback there.

832
00:38:17.366 --> 00:38:20.586
It's really important to note
that this isn't just iOS 8.

833
00:38:20.586 --> 00:38:24.056
So don't think that waiting to
update your app or game is going

834
00:38:24.056 --> 00:38:25.956
to get you out of this
because it's not going to.

835
00:38:26.916 --> 00:38:30.646
The ability to create families
is what's coming with iOS 8

836
00:38:31.426 --> 00:38:34.566
but this Ask to Buy
permission is going to apply

837
00:38:34.716 --> 00:38:38.876
to older versions of
iOS, Mac OS and Apple TV,

838
00:38:39.826 --> 00:38:42.836
so start preparing now.

839
00:38:43.426 --> 00:38:45.366
Now, whether or not a
transaction completes

840
00:38:45.366 --> 00:38:49.386
immediately or up to 24
hours later, you always want

841
00:38:49.456 --> 00:38:52.026
to confirm that that
transaction is completed.

842
00:38:52.026 --> 00:38:52.626
Let people know.

843
00:38:53.936 --> 00:38:57.736
So at a minimum, help people
find whatever they just bought.

844
00:38:57.736 --> 00:38:59.916
Let them know that
it's available for use.

845
00:39:00.896 --> 00:39:03.806
An example that you guys
probably see all the time is the

846
00:39:03.806 --> 00:39:04.666
App Store.

847
00:39:05.076 --> 00:39:08.016
So as soon as you confirm
payment for an application,

848
00:39:08.496 --> 00:39:10.566
you see that the app
starts to download.

849
00:39:10.866 --> 00:39:12.816
You get that feedback that
something's happening.

850
00:39:13.696 --> 00:39:14.756
Nothing's gone wrong.

851
00:39:14.906 --> 00:39:17.096
Your merchandise is
being transferred to you.

852
00:39:18.116 --> 00:39:21.606
And then you can open that app
directly from the App Store.

853
00:39:21.606 --> 00:39:22.566
You don't have to go digging

854
00:39:22.566 --> 00:39:25.176
around all your home screens
filled with apps to find it.

855
00:39:25.476 --> 00:39:29.656
You can just start playing
3's right there for hours.

856
00:39:30.586 --> 00:39:33.706
Now, another thing to think
about is if you have a game

857
00:39:33.706 --> 00:39:36.066
or a children's app,
something really fun,

858
00:39:36.216 --> 00:39:37.936
you can make this
a fun experience

859
00:39:37.936 --> 00:39:39.856
by using sound and animation.

860
00:39:40.766 --> 00:39:42.076
So this is Heads Up!

861
00:39:42.476 --> 00:39:45.666
It's a game that's really
popular with Ellen DeGeneres.

862
00:39:45.956 --> 00:39:48.286
She plays it on her
TV show all the time.

863
00:39:48.706 --> 00:39:49.956
It's a little bit like Charades.

864
00:39:49.956 --> 00:39:53.226
It's designed to play it with
real people in real life.

865
00:39:54.426 --> 00:39:57.576
Each of this deck of theme cards
are topics that you then act

866
00:39:57.576 --> 00:39:58.976
out for your friends
and try and guess.

867
00:39:59.186 --> 00:40:02.266
Now they give you a
couple of theme packs

868
00:39:59.186 --> 00:40:02.266
Now they give you a
couple of theme packs

869
00:40:02.266 --> 00:40:03.886
to get going to start playing.

870
00:40:04.566 --> 00:40:08.986
But then they also offer
a ton of other theme packs

871
00:40:08.986 --> 00:40:10.386
to enhance the experience.

872
00:40:10.886 --> 00:40:13.486
So check out what happens
when you buy one of these.

873
00:40:13.736 --> 00:40:14.976
I happen to be into
the 80's one.

874
00:40:22.181 --> 00:40:24.181
[ Music ]

875
00:40:24.346 --> 00:40:26.786
So you get that sound
and that animation

876
00:40:26.816 --> 00:40:28.576
that lets you know
something has happened.

877
00:40:28.806 --> 00:40:31.476
The purchase has gone through
and then they animate back

878
00:40:31.476 --> 00:40:34.416
up to the top so you can
see where your cards are

879
00:40:34.416 --> 00:40:39.146
and start playing right away.

880
00:40:39.986 --> 00:40:45.306
Now confirming that the
transaction is completed is

881
00:40:45.306 --> 00:40:47.156
especially important
with Ask to Buy

882
00:40:47.916 --> 00:40:50.846
because your customer may
not be at the same place

883
00:40:50.846 --> 00:40:53.056
where they were when they
requested the transaction,

884
00:40:53.056 --> 00:40:53.406
right?

885
00:40:54.036 --> 00:40:56.496
So if you had a comic app

886
00:40:56.496 --> 00:40:59.116
and say the child is
browsing all the comics

887
00:40:59.116 --> 00:41:02.686
that are available, they request
one and while they're waiting

888
00:40:59.116 --> 00:41:02.686
that are available, they request
one and while they're waiting

889
00:41:02.686 --> 00:41:06.746
for Mom or Dad to accept it,
well then they go and read one

890
00:41:06.746 --> 00:41:07.806
of the issues they already have.

891
00:41:09.116 --> 00:41:12.426
So you need to think about if
that transaction completes,

892
00:41:13.276 --> 00:41:15.866
how are you going to let
people know if it completes

893
00:41:15.866 --> 00:41:17.706
at a later time how you're
going to let people know

894
00:41:17.706 --> 00:41:23.566
where their merchandise
is and how to find it.

895
00:41:23.836 --> 00:41:27.146
Now no one wants to see
Error Code 128, right?

896
00:41:27.146 --> 00:41:29.676
It's confusing.

897
00:41:29.676 --> 00:41:33.196
It's frustrating to someone and
it can be a little alarming.

898
00:41:34.406 --> 00:41:37.216
So you want to know your error
codes and present information

899
00:41:37.216 --> 00:41:38.696
in a way that's going
to be meaningful

900
00:41:38.696 --> 00:41:41.326
to the people using your apps.

901
00:41:41.736 --> 00:41:43.836
Not all errors may
require a response.

902
00:41:44.246 --> 00:41:46.056
You don't have to tell
your people everything.

903
00:41:47.476 --> 00:41:50.256
Now if someone did
cancel a transaction,

904
00:41:50.256 --> 00:41:51.896
let's say that you're
using an app or game,

905
00:41:51.896 --> 00:41:53.116
you change your mind
about something.

906
00:41:53.116 --> 00:41:53.836
You cancel it.

907
00:41:54.506 --> 00:41:55.706
Is this what you want to see?

908
00:41:56.356 --> 00:41:57.356
This doesn't make sense.

909
00:41:57.996 --> 00:42:00.016
You may not need to
notify people at all

910
00:41:57.996 --> 00:42:00.016
You may not need to
notify people at all

911
00:42:00.696 --> 00:42:02.426
or you may just want to
make this a little more

912
00:42:02.636 --> 00:42:03.426
customer friendly.

913
00:42:04.086 --> 00:42:07.816
So the best experience,
of course,

914
00:42:07.816 --> 00:42:09.726
is to avoid errors entirely.

915
00:42:09.726 --> 00:42:11.616
So again, this afternoon's
session

916
00:42:11.696 --> 00:42:15.216
on optimizing StoreKit is going
to have a ton of technical tips

917
00:42:15.676 --> 00:42:18.546
about avoiding errors and
all those common pitfalls.

918
00:42:19.046 --> 00:42:25.246
Now another thing that I see
sometimes is that people tend

919
00:42:25.246 --> 00:42:26.926
to over ask for purchases.

920
00:42:28.376 --> 00:42:30.486
You want to let folks
get some enjoyment

921
00:42:30.586 --> 00:42:33.006
out of what they just bought
before you start asking them

922
00:42:33.006 --> 00:42:33.916
to buy something again.

923
00:42:34.546 --> 00:42:36.456
Again, don't be this guy.

924
00:42:37.936 --> 00:42:41.276
It's like at Christmas,
so you unwrap the toy

925
00:42:41.276 --> 00:42:44.446
and you're all excited
and then you realize, "Oh,

926
00:42:44.446 --> 00:42:46.506
it didn't come with
any batteries!"

927
00:42:47.706 --> 00:42:49.186
It's disappointing right?

928
00:42:49.186 --> 00:42:50.656
I mean, you just took something

929
00:42:50.656 --> 00:42:53.426
that was a really joyous
occasion and turned it

930
00:42:53.426 --> 00:42:55.546
into a frustrating
experience for people.

931
00:42:56.186 --> 00:42:58.686
So make sure that when
someone buys something,

932
00:42:58.686 --> 00:43:00.366
they can use what
they just bought.

933
00:42:58.686 --> 00:43:00.366
they can use what
they just bought.

934
00:43:00.906 --> 00:43:02.606
Give them that satisfaction.

935
00:43:02.706 --> 00:43:05.276
They shouldn't have to
make a subsequent purchase

936
00:43:05.326 --> 00:43:06.976
in order to enjoy it.

937
00:43:09.376 --> 00:43:13.096
And then like I said
earlier, less is more.

938
00:43:13.646 --> 00:43:16.056
You want to prioritize
the remaining purchases.

939
00:43:16.606 --> 00:43:20.076
Help people focus on what's
still available to them.

940
00:43:20.076 --> 00:43:22.956
If there's things they
can't buy, do prioritize

941
00:43:22.956 --> 00:43:26.086
that in the UI, especially
with nonconsumables.

942
00:43:26.206 --> 00:43:28.346
There is no need to keep
showing people something

943
00:43:28.346 --> 00:43:29.236
that they've already bought.

944
00:43:29.436 --> 00:43:31.726
They already own it.

945
00:43:32.136 --> 00:43:35.356
Now in some cases, it may
not make sense to hide items

946
00:43:35.356 --> 00:43:36.576
that have already been purchased

947
00:43:36.866 --> 00:43:42.636
but just don't let them
be the star of the show.

948
00:43:43.056 --> 00:43:45.956
And I think you're all aware
that it's very important

949
00:43:46.056 --> 00:43:48.336
that you let people
restore their purchases

950
00:43:48.336 --> 00:43:50.406
that they've made previously.

951
00:43:50.606 --> 00:43:52.776
They could have made
it on another device

952
00:43:53.136 --> 00:43:57.036
or they got a new piece of
hardware and it's important

953
00:43:57.036 --> 00:43:58.616
that they can retrieve what
they've already bought.

954
00:43:59.596 --> 00:44:03.436
This is "Brooklyn Magazine"
and they make it super easy.

955
00:43:59.596 --> 00:44:03.436
This is "Brooklyn Magazine"
and they make it super easy.

956
00:44:03.766 --> 00:44:05.276
If you already have
a subscription,

957
00:44:05.276 --> 00:44:08.276
well here's where to go to
start that restore process.

958
00:44:10.076 --> 00:44:11.456
But they took it
one step further.

959
00:44:12.516 --> 00:44:15.636
So if you were to tap on one
of these subscription options,

960
00:44:16.236 --> 00:44:18.376
you get the confirmation
to subscribe just

961
00:44:18.376 --> 00:44:19.306
like you would expect.

962
00:44:20.246 --> 00:44:24.916
But if you hit Cancel, they ask
if you're already a subscriber.

963
00:44:25.476 --> 00:44:29.156
And that's because there's
basically 2 reasons why you

964
00:44:29.156 --> 00:44:31.426
might cancel subscription
confirmation.

965
00:44:32.126 --> 00:44:35.846
One is if you changed your mind
about subscribing, of course.

966
00:44:36.126 --> 00:44:38.686
And that's a much bigger
problem for them to tackle.

967
00:44:39.546 --> 00:44:42.006
But the other is if you
already had a subscription.

968
00:44:42.396 --> 00:44:46.946
So in this case, they're
helping get you back on track.

969
00:44:47.266 --> 00:44:49.306
Now you all know it's
an App Store requirement

970
00:44:49.356 --> 00:44:51.766
to make restoring available.

971
00:44:52.556 --> 00:44:54.596
But a great experience
is going to make it easy.

972
00:44:54.596 --> 00:44:59.146
All right, so one last
tip in this section.

973
00:44:59.486 --> 00:45:01.516
And this is about notifications.

974
00:44:59.486 --> 00:45:01.516
And this is about notifications.

975
00:45:02.206 --> 00:45:05.746
You want to use them
thoughtfully and this applies

976
00:45:05.746 --> 00:45:09.086
to push notifications as
well as local notifications.

977
00:45:10.506 --> 00:45:13.036
Now you're not going to have
to notify children about Ask

978
00:45:13.226 --> 00:45:16.026
to Buy, purchases completing
because the App Store is going

979
00:45:16.026 --> 00:45:17.006
to handle that for you.

980
00:45:17.006 --> 00:45:20.746
But you do want to use
notifications to let people know

981
00:45:20.746 --> 00:45:24.436
about new content for
a subscription or maybe

982
00:45:24.436 --> 00:45:26.376
in those dating apps,
they could let me know

983
00:45:26.376 --> 00:45:28.656
if I have new recommended
matches.

984
00:45:29.826 --> 00:45:33.196
Circa does a great job
with their notifications.

985
00:45:33.616 --> 00:45:36.336
They serve up bite-sized
news articles

986
00:45:36.336 --> 00:45:38.566
and they give you
updates as it's happening.

987
00:45:39.366 --> 00:45:42.436
Now they're only going to send
notification if it's an article

988
00:45:42.436 --> 00:45:45.446
that I explicitly followed
or if it's something

989
00:45:45.446 --> 00:45:46.986
that they consider
breaking news.

990
00:45:47.946 --> 00:45:49.916
And they're very choosy

991
00:45:50.336 --> 00:45:52.076
about what they consider
breaking news.

992
00:45:52.506 --> 00:45:54.906
Now this is not breaking news.

993
00:45:54.986 --> 00:45:56.486
This is what I followed earlier.

994
00:45:57.166 --> 00:46:00.006
Swiping on that notification
takes you directly

995
00:45:57.166 --> 00:46:00.006
Swiping on that notification
takes you directly

996
00:46:00.006 --> 00:46:01.956
to the article so you
can read all about it.

997
00:46:02.306 --> 00:46:05.096
So they've made it really easy
for me to return to the content.

998
00:46:05.156 --> 00:46:10.186
So you want to be really
thoughtful about the kind

999
00:46:10.506 --> 00:46:13.126
and the number of notifications
that you're sending

1000
00:46:13.506 --> 00:46:15.856
because too many
notifications is just going

1001
00:46:15.856 --> 00:46:17.106
to annoy everybody.

1002
00:46:17.656 --> 00:46:20.406
And not only do you risk them
turning off notifications

1003
00:46:20.406 --> 00:46:23.566
entirely, they might just
wind up deleting your app,

1004
00:46:23.566 --> 00:46:25.456
if they get tired of
all the notifications.

1005
00:46:26.426 --> 00:46:28.806
That's not the experience
that we're after, right?

1006
00:46:28.936 --> 00:46:30.876
You want thoughtful
notifications

1007
00:46:30.936 --> 00:46:32.896
that will keep people
coming back

1008
00:46:33.716 --> 00:46:35.566
and make the app
feel more valuable

1009
00:46:35.566 --> 00:46:40.236
because suddenly there's
new content there.

1010
00:46:40.536 --> 00:46:43.116
Okay, so make sure that
you consider these things

1011
00:46:43.986 --> 00:46:46.156
after your customer's
pressed the buy button.

1012
00:46:46.386 --> 00:46:48.766
Completing the transaction
is super important.

1013
00:46:49.296 --> 00:46:53.266
Which brings us to the
final sort of stage

1014
00:46:53.266 --> 00:46:55.296
of a great experience
with in-app purchases

1015
00:46:55.296 --> 00:46:58.256
and that's measuring
and refining.

1016
00:46:59.186 --> 00:47:02.046
With all good design, it's
so important to iterate,

1017
00:46:59.186 --> 00:47:02.046
With all good design, it's
so important to iterate,

1018
00:47:02.476 --> 00:47:05.056
you want to measure the
success and quite frankly,

1019
00:47:05.056 --> 00:47:07.126
the failures of what you tried.

1020
00:47:07.626 --> 00:47:09.676
See how that has
an effect on things

1021
00:47:10.056 --> 00:47:12.546
and then make changes
based on those.

1022
00:47:13.586 --> 00:47:16.276
I mean, that all the things
that I mentioned today are going

1023
00:47:16.276 --> 00:47:19.096
to work for all product
types and all audiences.

1024
00:47:19.816 --> 00:47:22.816
So the more that you really fine
tune your approach, the better,

1025
00:47:23.256 --> 00:47:26.036
the more effective
it's going to be.

1026
00:47:26.036 --> 00:47:28.756
So here are some questions
that you can ask yourself

1027
00:47:29.346 --> 00:47:30.706
about the changes that you made

1028
00:47:30.706 --> 00:47:32.846
to help determine whether
they were successful.

1029
00:47:33.756 --> 00:47:36.646
So when were the changes
made and what were they?

1030
00:47:37.096 --> 00:47:40.246
Super important, you want
to make a detailed note

1031
00:47:40.246 --> 00:47:43.196
about exactly when you made
changes and all the things

1032
00:47:43.196 --> 00:47:44.616
that you updated so
you have something

1033
00:47:44.616 --> 00:47:45.776
to measure against later.

1034
00:47:46.196 --> 00:47:50.856
You also want to think about
how has the number of changes,

1035
00:47:51.096 --> 00:47:52.866
how has the number
of purchases changed?

1036
00:47:54.006 --> 00:47:55.426
Hopefully they've
gone up, right?

1037
00:47:57.426 --> 00:48:00.626
And are different things being
purchased from different places

1038
00:47:57.426 --> 00:48:00.626
And are different things being
purchased from different places

1039
00:48:00.626 --> 00:48:03.646
in the application as a result
of integrating your merchandise?

1040
00:48:04.116 --> 00:48:05.966
Are you selling higher
value items?

1041
00:48:06.466 --> 00:48:10.686
And what's the average
revenue per device?

1042
00:48:10.766 --> 00:48:13.116
And this is going to be
really easy to see in the fall

1043
00:48:13.116 --> 00:48:15.646
with the new iTunes Connect
because we have a ton

1044
00:48:15.646 --> 00:48:18.786
of app analytics coming
for you all for free.

1045
00:48:18.786 --> 00:48:20.896
And this helps you learn whether

1046
00:48:20.896 --> 00:48:23.016
or not a marketing
campaign was worth it.

1047
00:48:23.376 --> 00:48:26.466
If you invested a certain
amount of money per device

1048
00:48:26.796 --> 00:48:29.426
and you're not seeing that
revenue come back in, well,

1049
00:48:29.596 --> 00:48:32.976
that campaign's not going to
be a good investment for you.

1050
00:48:33.666 --> 00:48:35.716
And finally, keep an eye out.

1051
00:48:35.806 --> 00:48:38.126
Are people returning
more frequently?

1052
00:48:38.876 --> 00:48:41.406
Because if they are,
that's an indication

1053
00:48:41.406 --> 00:48:44.826
that you have a really great
experience, that the quality

1054
00:48:44.826 --> 00:48:48.306
of the experience has gone up.

1055
00:48:49.146 --> 00:48:53.216
So I hope that you guys
will take at least one

1056
00:48:53.216 --> 00:48:56.676
of the design tips that I gave
you today and implement it

1057
00:48:56.676 --> 00:49:00.606
in your app or game and
then see how it affects the

1058
00:48:56.676 --> 00:49:00.606
in your app or game and
then see how it affects the

1059
00:49:00.606 --> 00:49:01.806
overall experience.

1060
00:49:02.396 --> 00:49:03.106
Because I think you're going

1061
00:49:03.106 --> 00:49:05.076
to be really happy
with the results.

1062
00:49:05.796 --> 00:49:08.726
And I would like to
hear how it goes.

1063
00:49:08.806 --> 00:49:10.026
This is my email address.

1064
00:49:11.176 --> 00:49:12.016
So let me know.

1065
00:49:12.476 --> 00:49:13.616
Let me know what you changed.

1066
00:49:13.616 --> 00:49:16.276
Let me know the effects that
it's having on your sales.

1067
00:49:17.216 --> 00:49:20.026
And if you would like more
design advice, we have tons

1068
00:49:20.026 --> 00:49:24.256
of it at Designing Great Apps
up at developer.apple.com.

1069
00:49:24.946 --> 00:49:26.726
And if you don't all have a copy

1070
00:49:26.726 --> 00:49:28.526
of the Human Interface
Guidelines,

1071
00:49:28.726 --> 00:49:31.276
it's a great resource,
a lot of good tips.

1072
00:49:31.666 --> 00:49:33.216
It's available on
the iBooks Store now.

1073
00:49:34.236 --> 00:49:38.216
So here are all the related
sessions you might want to see.

1074
00:49:38.626 --> 00:49:41.076
Ingredients of Great Games
was yesterday and that talks

1075
00:49:41.076 --> 00:49:44.316
about how to have a really
great gaming experience.

1076
00:49:44.766 --> 00:49:47.556
And so the video should
be available online

1077
00:49:47.556 --> 00:49:48.436
and you can watch it.

1078
00:49:48.976 --> 00:49:51.646
And just before the session
was the new iTunes Connect

1079
00:49:52.196 --> 00:49:54.626
which had all the information
about app analytics.

1080
00:49:54.696 --> 00:49:57.806
So look for that video
to be out later today.

1081
00:49:58.196 --> 00:50:02.086
And then we have our Optimizing
In-App Purchases later today

1082
00:49:58.196 --> 00:50:02.086
And then we have our Optimizing
In-App Purchases later today

1083
00:50:02.086 --> 00:50:04.876
in this room, tons of
great technical tips.

1084
00:50:04.876 --> 00:50:10.606
And there's a prototyping
session tomorrow morning that's

1085
00:50:10.606 --> 00:50:13.426
going to tell you all about
how to quickly iterate and test

1086
00:50:13.426 --> 00:50:16.756
out the value and it's a great
session to figure out how

1087
00:50:16.756 --> 00:50:19.286
to quickly test things
out that you might want

1088
00:50:19.286 --> 00:50:21.026
to integrate into your app.

1089
00:50:21.416 --> 00:50:24.396
And finally, on Friday, come

1090
00:50:24.496 --> 00:50:27.216
to Preventing Unauthorized
Purchases with Receipts

1091
00:50:27.686 --> 00:50:30.356
because you're offering
really valuable things

1092
00:50:30.466 --> 00:50:32.136
and we only want you
to be giving them

1093
00:50:32.136 --> 00:50:33.276
to people who've paid for them.

1094
00:50:33.476 --> 00:50:37.866
So it's going to be a very
detailed technical heavy session

1095
00:50:38.076 --> 00:50:39.086
that you'll want to check out.

1096
00:50:39.976 --> 00:50:41.426
So thanks so much everybody!

1097
00:50:41.426 --> 00:50:42.736
Enjoy the rest of
the conference.

1098
00:50:43.516 --> 00:50:48.980
[ Applause ]
