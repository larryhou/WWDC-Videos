00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:21.416
Welcome to "The New
iTunes Connect."

4
00:00:22.316 --> 00:00:23.476
I'm Dave Van Tassell,

5
00:00:23.596 --> 00:00:26.046
Engineering Manager
here at iTunes Connect.

6
00:00:26.046 --> 00:00:28.036
We have a lot of great things
to talk to you about today.

7
00:00:28.646 --> 00:00:30.316
To do so, I'm going
to need the clicker

8
00:00:30.316 --> 00:00:31.226
over on this desk right here.

9
00:00:31.516 --> 00:00:35.246
It all starts with a new design.

10
00:00:36.096 --> 00:00:37.636
We want to take you on a
little bit of a walkthrough,

11
00:00:37.696 --> 00:00:39.806
some of the new features
that we've added,

12
00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:41.606
some of the new flows.

13
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.366
Second thing is app previews.

14
00:00:44.896 --> 00:00:48.416
It's a great chance for you to
upload a video 15 to 30 seconds,

15
00:00:49.126 --> 00:00:51.946
dynamic view of what
makes your app magical.

16
00:00:52.416 --> 00:00:57.636
App bundles - you can bundle
up to 10 apps together

17
00:00:58.956 --> 00:01:00.856
with an easy set-up
flow in iTunes Connect.

00:00:58.956 --> 00:01:00.856
with an easy set-up
flow in iTunes Connect.

19
00:01:01.586 --> 00:01:03.946
App analytics - we're
very excited about this.

20
00:01:03.946 --> 00:01:06.596
This is the best end to end
view of your app with data

21
00:01:06.596 --> 00:01:08.106
that only Apple can provide.

23
00:01:15.436 --> 00:01:17.886
And last, TestFlight

[ Applause ]

25
00:01:23.046 --> 00:01:24.096
We're very excited about this.

26
00:01:24.096 --> 00:01:26.846
Give you a little
more insight and depth

27
00:01:26.846 --> 00:01:29.736
into what we have planned
for TestFlight beta testing.

28
00:01:30.906 --> 00:01:32.396
So we start with the Home page

29
00:01:32.506 --> 00:01:34.996
of iTunes Connect,
an all new design.

30
00:01:34.996 --> 00:01:39.096
We have the same sections as
today, with great new icons.

31
00:01:39.946 --> 00:01:42.406
If you have any news or
announcements for you,

32
00:01:42.456 --> 00:01:45.006
like perhaps you haven't
signed the latest contract

33
00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:47.086
that released, that's going
to go right there on the top.

34
00:01:47.996 --> 00:01:51.596
But we came here to work
today, so let's jump

35
00:01:51.596 --> 00:01:53.916
into My Apps and
see what we have.

36
00:01:55.136 --> 00:01:56.016
The first thing you're going

37
00:01:56.016 --> 00:01:57.926
to notice is it's
wall to wall apps.

38
00:01:58.326 --> 00:01:59.946
We're trying to give it
as much space as we can

39
00:01:59.946 --> 00:02:04.486
for all these apps, fit
more apps onto the page,

40
00:01:59.946 --> 00:02:04.486
for all these apps, fit
more apps onto the page,

41
00:02:04.676 --> 00:02:07.996
at the same time giving each app
a little more space to breathe,

42
00:02:08.416 --> 00:02:12.316
the full name of the app, the
complete iTunes Connect status.

43
00:02:12.816 --> 00:02:14.626
Easier to tell the
difference between waiting

44
00:02:14.626 --> 00:02:16.096
for review and in review.

45
00:02:17.016 --> 00:02:20.006
Also we've added a little badge
there to show the difference

46
00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:22.336
between iOS and Mac apps.

47
00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:26.796
If you came to the My Apps page
to check on, perhaps the status

48
00:02:26.796 --> 00:02:29.816
of an app, to see if the "Hair
Salon" app has been approved

49
00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:33.406
and is ready to go, there at
the top we have an iSearch bar,

50
00:02:34.856 --> 00:02:37.716
type in "hair salon," and
all the hair salon apps float

51
00:02:37.716 --> 00:02:38.196
to the top.

52
00:02:38.646 --> 00:02:40.436
I see it's all green;
green is good.

53
00:02:40.636 --> 00:02:42.606
My app's been approved,
it's ready for sale,

54
00:02:43.766 --> 00:02:45.296
I'm off to go check
and see how it's doing.

55
00:02:46.556 --> 00:02:48.536
We've also added some filtering.

56
00:02:48.536 --> 00:02:53.106
You can see there in the
top right-hand corner,

57
00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:54.306
the search by status.

58
00:02:55.276 --> 00:02:57.636
You can filter - and see I
have 24 different statuses,

59
00:02:57.836 --> 00:02:59.226
23 are ready for sale.

60
00:02:59.306 --> 00:03:00.636
I have one prepared for upload.

61
00:02:59.306 --> 00:03:00.636
I have one prepared for upload.

62
00:03:01.086 --> 00:03:02.746
If I want to click on
one of these statuses,

63
00:03:02.746 --> 00:03:04.236
then I'll filter away
all the other apps

64
00:03:04.236 --> 00:03:06.966
and show just the apps with
this iTunes Connect status.

65
00:03:07.516 --> 00:03:10.016
Some of you like the list view;
we've improved that as well.

66
00:03:11.126 --> 00:03:15.716
More apps on one page, the
same search and filtering

67
00:03:15.816 --> 00:03:18.236
that we've provided on
the icon view also exists

68
00:03:18.236 --> 00:03:18.976
on this list view.

69
00:03:19.586 --> 00:03:23.276
You can sort by the different
column names, change that up.

70
00:03:23.276 --> 00:03:26.656
And what's great is if you leave
the My Apps page and come back,

71
00:03:26.656 --> 00:03:29.076
or if you sign out iTunes
Connect, when you come back

72
00:03:29.136 --> 00:03:31.356
to My Apps we'll take you
right back to the list view.

73
00:03:31.356 --> 00:03:36.166
We're going to go back into the
icon view and jump into an app.

74
00:03:38.036 --> 00:03:40.156
What we've done here is
combine the app pages

75
00:03:40.156 --> 00:03:41.846
and the version pages into one,

76
00:03:42.236 --> 00:03:44.016
because at the top
we have the app icon,

77
00:03:44.016 --> 00:03:48.216
and going across we have
different tabs, we have pricing,

78
00:03:48.316 --> 00:03:51.356
we have In-App Purchases,
manage your Game Center.

79
00:03:52.636 --> 00:03:55.926
We take you by default to the
version tab and to the ready

80
00:03:55.926 --> 00:03:57.416
for sale version of My App.

81
00:03:57.416 --> 00:04:01.276

right there in front of me

right there in front of me

83

and other metadata as it goes.

84
00:04:02.936 --> 00:04:05.266
What we want to do is
create a new version.

85
00:04:05.516 --> 00:04:08.246
So we click on the upper
right-hand corner there,

86
00:04:08.246 --> 00:04:11.096
it's the new version button,
and we're provided with a window

87
00:04:11.616 --> 00:04:13.046
to enter in our version number.

88
00:04:14.236 --> 00:04:17.866
You'll notice there's no "what's
new" text on this window.

89
00:04:18.656 --> 00:04:20.896
This information is still
required, but we understand

90
00:04:21.276 --> 00:04:23.656
that you don't always have
all the marketing data ready

91
00:04:23.906 --> 00:04:25.836
when you want to take actions
like create a new version.

92
00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:29.186
And in fact, we've added this
to the new app flow as well.

93
00:04:29.466 --> 00:04:32.246
When you create a new app,
all you need is a name,

94
00:04:32.546 --> 00:04:34.016
a bundle ID and a SKU.

00:04:40.396 --> 00:04:41.806
This is the new iTunes
Connect, right?

97
00:04:42.556 --> 00:04:44.756
You can come back when you're
ready to do those descriptions,

98
00:04:44.756 --> 00:04:46.236
those screenshots
and what have you.

99
00:04:47.266 --> 00:04:48.976
All right, so we're going
to create this new version.

100
00:04:49.976 --> 00:04:54.846
It'll create a new sub-tab
there with the 1.0.2.

101
00:04:55.386 --> 00:04:58.796
It's copied over the screenshots

102
00:04:58.796 --> 00:05:00.576
from the previous
version, like normal.

103
00:04:58.796 --> 00:05:00.576
from the previous
version, like normal.

104
00:05:00.576 --> 00:05:01.836
We can see that the What's New

105
00:05:01.836 --> 00:05:03.456
in this version text
hasn't been filled in.

106
00:05:03.456 --> 00:05:05.406
I can fill it in
now, either way.

107
00:05:06.156 --> 00:05:08.086
I keep scrolling down,
and I see the rest

108
00:05:08.086 --> 00:05:10.556
of my version information.

109
00:05:10.556 --> 00:05:13.226
I can change that right
now, easy to edit.

110
00:05:13.356 --> 00:05:15.616
I can save and come back later.

111
00:05:16.146 --> 00:05:22.426
But we came here today to
create the iPad version

112
00:05:22.426 --> 00:05:23.456
of this app, make it universal.

113
00:05:24.276 --> 00:05:29.366
So I'm going to click on the
iPad tab, and what I need

114
00:05:29.366 --> 00:05:31.286
for an iPad is new screenshots,

115
00:05:31.356 --> 00:05:34.426
that's really the only metadata
difference iPhones and iPads.

116
00:05:35.436 --> 00:05:38.956
And screenshots are great:
five snapshots of what's going

117
00:05:38.956 --> 00:05:40.606
on in my app, right now.

118
00:05:41.166 --> 00:05:45.796
But we also want to give
a more dynamic experience.

119
00:05:46.276 --> 00:05:47.696
We want to upload
an app preview.

120

app that's magical

that makes people
want to click on it?

124
00:05:57.396 --> 00:05:59.996
and upload this app
preview here as well.

125
00:06:01.056 --> 00:06:05.286
Now we could do screenshot
1, then upload screenshot 2,

126
00:06:05.286 --> 00:06:08.836
and then upload screenshot
3, and then upload the video,

Connect, and we're just going

preview's going to be first,

preview is selected a default

click Play on your video.

poster frame image,

we click edit poster frame,
and up pops the video itself

that we've selected.

that we want, we
can drag and drop.

Anytime we find a frame that we

145
00:06:57.456 --> 00:07:00.756
like we click set poster
frame, we're off to go.

146
00:06:57.456 --> 00:07:00.756
like we click set poster
frame, we're off to go.

I know in my case, the frame
that I would like to use is

148
00:07:03.746 --> 00:07:05.976
at the end of my video, so I'm
just going to scrub on through,

149
00:07:06.736 --> 00:07:09.236
find this one that I
like, this is great.

00:08:31.926 --> 00:08:32.916
They want to see your app.

172
00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:35.166
What is it about your
app that's great?

173
00:08:35.206 --> 00:08:37.586
They don't want to be sold
to it; it's not an ad.

174
00:08:38.796 --> 00:08:40.856
You can capture this
video straight

175
00:08:40.856 --> 00:08:43.606
from iOS 8 onto OS X Yosemite.

176
00:08:44.176 --> 00:08:49.576
App previews are up to
30 seconds in length,

177
00:08:50.986 --> 00:08:54.066
and we accept both H.264
and ProRes content.

178
00:08:55.196 --> 00:08:56.056
And that's app previews.

179
00:08:57.516 --> 00:09:02.526
[ Applause ]

180
00:08:57.516 --> 00:09:02.526
[ Applause ]

181
00:09:03.026 --> 00:09:04.176
Now we move on to App Bundles.

182
00:09:04.926 --> 00:09:09.456
App Bundles is a great
feature to bundle together apps

183
00:09:09.456 --> 00:09:14.006
of the same kind, giving
your customers and people

184
00:09:14.006 --> 00:09:15.496
on the App Store just
one choice instead

185
00:09:15.496 --> 00:09:16.756
of many on what to download.

186
00:09:17.716 --> 00:09:20.836
The first step if you want to
have an app bundle is, well,

187
00:09:20.836 --> 00:09:23.566
what apps do I put in my bundle?

188
00:09:23.696 --> 00:09:24.746
So, you have all the apps

189
00:09:24.746 --> 00:09:26.546
in your head whether it's iTunes
Connect, and you're trying

190
00:09:26.546 --> 00:09:28.026
to think about it, you got
to choose some of them.

191
00:09:28.026 --> 00:09:28.996
You can have up to 10.

192
00:09:29.626 --> 00:09:31.876
In this case I'm going
to pick four of them

193
00:09:32.396 --> 00:09:33.206
and create an app bundle.

194
00:09:33.676 --> 00:09:34.406
And this is great.

195
00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:37.466
It offers more value for
the people on the App Store.

196
00:09:38.346 --> 00:09:41.066
It's a single install to get
all of your great apps at once.

197
00:09:41.386 --> 00:09:44.456
And we've included in
this Complete my Bundle.

198
00:09:45.096 --> 00:09:47.696
It's the same feature we
give for music and for TV,

199
00:09:48.246 --> 00:09:50.146
where if somebody's already
purchased one or more

200
00:09:50.146 --> 00:09:53.906
of the apps in your bundle, then
they'll get a discounted price

201
00:09:54.076 --> 00:09:56.166
to purchase the rest of your
bundle to encourage them

202
00:09:56.336 --> 00:09:58.476
to get all of your apps.

203
00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:02.646
[ Applause ]

204
00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:02.646
[ Applause ]

205
00:10:03.146 --> 00:10:06.576
So that was step one, selecting
what apps go in my bundle.

206
00:10:06.886 --> 00:10:09.456
The next thing we're going
to want is the metadata

207
00:10:09.456 --> 00:10:10.606
to show in the iTunes store.

208
00:10:11.386 --> 00:10:12.546
We're going to need
a bundle name,

209
00:10:12.546 --> 00:10:13.416
we're going to need
a description.

210
00:10:13.416 --> 00:10:16.006
It's probably going to need
screenshots, app preview,

211
00:10:16.636 --> 00:10:20.476
got to select categories,
rating, marketing URLs,

212
00:10:20.476 --> 00:10:22.126
privacy URLs, all
these different pieces.

213
00:10:23.256 --> 00:10:25.866
Because we want to make this
as simple as possible for you,

214
00:10:25.866 --> 00:10:28.516
and we realize that we have a
lot of this information already.

215
00:10:29.086 --> 00:10:33.346
So it starts with information
that is specific to the bundle.

216
00:10:33.716 --> 00:10:35.146
Each bundle will
need its own name;

217
00:10:35.456 --> 00:10:37.296
it'll need a description
about the bundle.

218
00:10:38.426 --> 00:10:41.716
Obviously it has its own
price, has its own SKU

219
00:10:42.956 --> 00:10:46.436
and a marketing URL so you can
market this bundle on its own.

220
00:10:47.366 --> 00:10:49.526
And then we have
this information

221
00:10:49.526 --> 00:10:50.656
that comes from the first app.

222
00:10:50.656 --> 00:10:54.996
It was that key app, the
first app for this bundle.

223
00:10:55.726 --> 00:10:57.826
So the first screenshot
will come from that app,

224
00:10:57.916 --> 00:10:59.716
the first app preview
that you see

225
00:10:59.716 --> 00:11:02.046
on the App Store will
come from that app.

226
00:10:59.716 --> 00:11:02.046
on the App Store will
come from that app.

227
00:11:02.306 --> 00:11:04.996
The categories of
your bundle will match

228
00:11:05.046 --> 00:11:09.246
that of the first app, and the
App Store contact information,

229
00:11:09.246 --> 00:11:11.696
App review information,
all of that will be pulled

230
00:11:11.696 --> 00:11:15.706
from the first app as well,
as well as the privacy URL.

231
00:11:15.706 --> 00:11:22.176
The rest of the information from
your bundle will come from all

232
00:11:22.176 --> 00:11:23.086
of the apps in the bundle.

233
00:11:23.626 --> 00:11:27.816
If you have three apps that are
4 plus, and one app is 12 plus,

234
00:11:28.046 --> 00:11:29.676
your bundle will
be rated 12 plus.

235
00:11:30.786 --> 00:11:33.776
If you want your bundle to be
made for kids, all of the apps

236
00:11:33.856 --> 00:11:35.886
in the bundle must
be made for kids.

237
00:11:37.856 --> 00:11:40.946
The rest of the screenshots
and app previews will come

238
00:11:41.066 --> 00:11:43.186
from the other apps in your
bundle - and equal share

239
00:11:43.356 --> 00:11:44.396
for every app in your bundle.

240
00:11:44.966 --> 00:11:49.096
And for keywords we'll take
all of the keywords from all

241
00:11:49.096 --> 00:11:51.316
of the apps in the
bundle and apply those.

242
00:11:51.626 --> 00:11:53.156
You don't have to
re-enter any new keywords.

243
00:11:53.566 --> 00:11:58.416
Let's take a look and see how
we do this in iTunes Connect.

244
00:11:58.536 --> 00:11:59.926
We come back to the
My Apps page.

245
00:12:00.446 --> 00:12:03.996
We click New App Bundle.

246
00:12:04.596 --> 00:12:06.856
The first thing we want to enter

247
00:12:07.706 --> 00:12:11.006
as our new app bundle
name, "Toca Toy Box."

248
00:12:11.776 --> 00:12:12.976
We start selecting the apps.

249
00:12:18.016 --> 00:12:20.266
At this point I realize, OK,

250
00:12:20.526 --> 00:12:22.446
this first app is
important, it's key.

251
00:12:23.056 --> 00:12:25.486
So, I know which four I
want in my app bundle,

252
00:12:26.286 --> 00:12:29.586
but I would like to make
this one that primary app.

253
00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:32.336
Once I've selected my apps,

254
00:12:33.316 --> 00:12:36.456
I can now see I have my
screenshots have already been

255
00:12:36.456 --> 00:12:38.336
populated for me
from that first app.

256
00:12:38.336 --> 00:12:43.586
I can fill in the app bundle
description, the marketing URL.

257
00:12:44.366 --> 00:12:46.926
Privacy policy URL
has already been done.

258
00:12:47.486 --> 00:12:49.506
Let's scroll down further.

259
00:12:49.926 --> 00:12:52.276
I need to select a price tier.

260
00:12:52.276 --> 00:12:56.466
It needs to be a discounted
price tier, less, one tier less

261
00:12:56.466 --> 00:12:58.816
than the sum of all the apps in
the bundle - it is a discount -

262
00:12:59.336 --> 00:13:01.346
as well as give it a SKU.

263
00:12:59.336 --> 00:13:01.346
as well as give it a SKU.

264
00:13:01.346 --> 00:13:03.226
Then the rest of the information
has already been filled in:

265
00:13:03.486 --> 00:13:05.616
categories, the rating.

266
00:13:06.436 --> 00:13:07.716
I'm good to go, at
this point I'm done.

267
00:13:07.716 --> 00:13:09.926
I've created my app bundle,
I'm ready to submit it.

268
00:13:10.936 --> 00:13:13.226
One thing to remember
with app bundles is

269
00:13:13.226 --> 00:13:14.176
that once they've been submitted

270
00:13:14.176 --> 00:13:15.866
to the App Store you
can't change the apps

271
00:13:15.936 --> 00:13:17.516
in a bundle; they're immutable.

272
00:13:18.096 --> 00:13:22.476
If you want to make a
bundle with now five apps

273
00:13:22.476 --> 00:13:23.646
or six apps instead
of this four,

274
00:13:23.646 --> 00:13:25.276
then just create a
new bundle and submit

275
00:13:25.276 --> 00:13:25.966
that to the App Store.

276
00:13:26.456 --> 00:13:28.936
Here's what it looks
like on the App Store.

277
00:13:29.146 --> 00:13:30.426
You can see your app icon.

278
00:13:30.856 --> 00:13:32.426
You can see all the
apps in the bundle.

279
00:13:33.016 --> 00:13:36.676
The app preview and
screenshots come down below.

280
00:13:37.296 --> 00:13:41.286
You can have up to 10 paid
apps in an app bundle.

281
00:13:41.286 --> 00:13:44.696
You have to give it
that discounted price.

282
00:13:45.626 --> 00:13:49.506
The first preview and screenshot
come from that first app.

283
00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:51.266
We're going to link
to all the other apps

284
00:13:51.266 --> 00:13:53.006
in your bundle right
there on the App Store.

285
00:13:53.886 --> 00:13:55.066
And with Complete My Bundle,

286
00:13:55.066 --> 00:13:57.026
people who have already
purchased one or more

287
00:13:57.026 --> 00:13:59.706
of those apps will
get discounted price

288
00:13:59.706 --> 00:14:00.796
to purchase the rest
of your bundle

289
00:13:59.706 --> 00:14:00.796
to purchase the rest
of your bundle

290
00:14:00.986 --> 00:14:01.896
and get the whole package.

291
00:14:02.356 --> 00:14:03.236
And that's App Bundles.

292
00:14:03.996 --> 00:14:05.826
With that, I'd like to turn
the time over to Trystan

293
00:14:05.906 --> 00:14:07.086
to talk about App Analytics.

294
00:14:08.516 --> 00:14:13.656
[ Applause ]

295
00:14:14.156 --> 00:14:14.856
>> Thank you, Dave.

296
00:14:15.356 --> 00:14:16.806
My name is Trystan Kosmynka,

297
00:14:16.986 --> 00:14:18.986
Engineering Manager
working on App Analytics.

298
00:14:19.506 --> 00:14:22.146
Really excited today to show
you what we've been up to.

299
00:14:23.166 --> 00:14:24.116
Before we get into it,

300
00:14:24.116 --> 00:14:26.316
let's talk about what it
takes to build a great app.

301
00:14:26.516 --> 00:14:28.716
We're all here this week
to learn tips and tricks

302
00:14:28.986 --> 00:14:29.936
on building a great app.

303
00:14:30.526 --> 00:14:32.866
We know that it all
starts with a great idea.

304
00:14:34.096 --> 00:14:35.526
Every app that's
in the store today

305
00:14:35.526 --> 00:14:37.936
that achieves great success
starts with a great idea,

306
00:14:38.276 --> 00:14:41.846
and how do you capture that and
present that to your customers?

307
00:14:42.216 --> 00:14:43.826
You do that with
thoughtful design,

308
00:14:44.356 --> 00:14:46.576
pixel-perfect design,
intuitive design.

309
00:14:46.976 --> 00:14:49.326
You focus on really
complete flows

310
00:14:49.326 --> 00:14:50.946
that make sense to
your customers.

311
00:14:51.396 --> 00:14:55.126
We write bug-free code, we
all here write bug-free code.

312
00:14:56.466 --> 00:14:57.436
Worked on my device.

313
00:14:59.506 --> 00:15:01.356
We test, and we test,
and we test some more.

314
00:14:59.506 --> 00:15:01.356
We test, and we test,
and we test some more.

315
00:15:01.546 --> 00:15:04.626
So, we have automated unit
tests, automated UI tests.

316
00:15:04.626 --> 00:15:05.356
We're going to talk more

317
00:15:05.356 --> 00:15:07.466
about our beta testing
service as well.

318
00:15:07.766 --> 00:15:09.716
This is a really
important part of writing

319
00:15:09.716 --> 00:15:11.506
and creating a great app.

320
00:15:12.116 --> 00:15:13.836
Finally, we submit to the store.

321
00:15:14.096 --> 00:15:17.176
These are all pieces,
developer responsibility

322
00:15:17.176 --> 00:15:18.146
that we're familiar with today,

323
00:15:18.146 --> 00:15:21.506
and Apple does a fantastic job
supporting you throughout this

324
00:15:21.546 --> 00:15:24.686
process, with great tools,
with Xcode, more great tools

325
00:15:24.686 --> 00:15:26.056
and services we're
talking about today.

326
00:15:26.056 --> 00:15:29.646
But we know that our job
is not done as developers.

327
00:15:29.776 --> 00:15:31.056
Once we submit to the store,

328
00:15:31.056 --> 00:15:33.116
there's this whole new
set of responsibilities.

329
00:15:33.726 --> 00:15:34.416
We're not all done.

330
00:15:35.876 --> 00:15:37.406
And this is after launch.

331
00:15:37.406 --> 00:15:39.426
And this is what App
Analytics is all about.

332
00:15:40.446 --> 00:15:43.276
These new responsibilities
can influence this chart.

333
00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:45.836
Hopefully, if you have
apps in the store,

334
00:15:46.116 --> 00:15:47.226
this chart is familiar to you.

335
00:15:47.226 --> 00:15:50.136
You have your downloads
over time, it's increasing,

336
00:15:50.596 --> 00:15:53.546
and you see points of
acceleration over time as well.

337
00:15:53.706 --> 00:15:55.796
Let's talk about what it
takes to influence that,

338
00:15:56.096 --> 00:15:57.736
and why App Analytics
is really important.

339
00:15:58.266 --> 00:16:01.366
So first, our App
Store presence.

340
00:15:58.266 --> 00:16:01.366
So first, our App
Store presence.

341
00:16:01.656 --> 00:16:04.356
We can see on this chart now I
have that orange dot and I see

342
00:16:04.356 --> 00:16:10.506
that App Store presence really
can influence my downloads.

343
00:16:11.586 --> 00:16:15.806
App Store presence is your name,
your description, your keywords.

344
00:16:15.926 --> 00:16:17.386
We have these App Bundles now.

345
00:16:17.386 --> 00:16:19.706
We also have our
App Store previews.

346
00:16:20.026 --> 00:16:22.796
These are great ways to get
your app to have more downloads,

347
00:16:22.796 --> 00:16:25.556
more customers, more
people using your app.

348
00:16:26.126 --> 00:16:26.656
Marketing.

349
00:16:26.976 --> 00:16:29.066
Once you have a great app
you want to get the word out.

350
00:16:29.486 --> 00:16:31.776
As developers, we don't
just submit to the store,

351
00:16:31.776 --> 00:16:33.416
we submit it to our
social networks,

352
00:16:33.416 --> 00:16:34.946
we send it to our
friends and our family.

353
00:16:35.346 --> 00:16:37.676
We create a home page,
potentially some newsletters.

354
00:16:38.056 --> 00:16:39.616
Marketing's a really
important piece.

355
00:16:40.446 --> 00:16:41.236
New updates.

356
00:16:41.776 --> 00:16:43.966
When you're building an
application and submit it

357
00:16:43.966 --> 00:16:47.046
to the store your
customers crave new content.

358
00:16:47.536 --> 00:16:54.706
New levels, new ways to engage
existing customers and new ways

359
00:16:54.706 --> 00:16:55.876
to attract more customers.

360
00:16:56.156 --> 00:17:00.046
Your app needs to stay fresh and
unique, and to do that you go

361
00:16:56.156 --> 00:17:00.046
Your app needs to stay fresh and
unique, and to do that you go

362
00:17:00.046 --> 00:17:02.306
through this constant
release and build cycle.

363
00:17:02.766 --> 00:17:05.126
Next is advertising.

364
00:17:05.126 --> 00:17:08.506
Advertising and marketing
are often used

365
00:17:08.566 --> 00:17:09.976
in the same vocabulary,

366
00:17:10.276 --> 00:17:11.566
but advertising's a
little bit different.

367
00:17:12.175 --> 00:17:15.406
As a developer you may choose
to pay for advertising,

368
00:17:15.406 --> 00:17:16.415
and that's a big decision.

369
00:17:16.695 --> 00:17:19.846
You want to know if it was worth
the advertising investment,

370
00:17:20.106 --> 00:17:21.606
if you got a nice
return on that.

371
00:17:21.935 --> 00:17:24.846
App Analytics is there to help
you inform those decisions.

372
00:17:25.165 --> 00:17:32.156
All of these dots, all these
lines, you want to monitor,

373
00:17:32.156 --> 00:17:34.916
measure and see how
they're changing over time,

374
00:17:35.296 --> 00:17:37.636
and App Analytics is there
to provide those answers.

375
00:17:37.886 --> 00:17:40.136
And that is why we
use App Analytics.

376
00:17:40.426 --> 00:17:42.186
Because App Analytics
provides answers.

377
00:17:43.526 --> 00:17:46.986
It helps you answer questions
like, "How's my app doing?

378
00:17:47.906 --> 00:17:51.586
Are people returning to my app?"

379
00:17:51.586 --> 00:17:53.606
Are people converting on
your In-App Purchases?

380
00:17:55.766 --> 00:17:58.916
App Analytics helps you make
good advertising decisions.

381
00:17:59.376 --> 00:18:02.436
And this is one I'm
really excited about.

382
00:17:59.376 --> 00:18:02.436
And this is one I'm
really excited about.

383
00:18:02.496 --> 00:18:04.736
App Analytics helps you
reveal missed opportunities.

384
00:18:05.296 --> 00:18:06.746
With App Analytics you can see

385
00:18:06.746 --> 00:18:09.576
that your App Store presence
is great in the United States,

386
00:18:09.576 --> 00:18:12.156
and a lot of customers
are looking at your app

387
00:18:12.156 --> 00:18:13.946
in the United States
and actually turning

388
00:18:13.946 --> 00:18:16.976
into real customers as
opposed to potential customers.

389
00:18:17.806 --> 00:18:19.696
The same may not be
the case in Germany.

390
00:18:20.296 --> 00:18:24.446
With App Analytics we can see
that the potential customers

391
00:18:24.446 --> 00:18:27.566
in Germany can become
actual customers if we focus

392
00:18:27.566 --> 00:18:30.366
on our German App Store
presence, localization,

393
00:18:30.726 --> 00:18:33.236
really understanding the German
culture and understanding

394
00:18:33.236 --> 00:18:37.826
that marketing to Germany may be
a completely different animal,

395
00:18:37.826 --> 00:18:39.836
and we can do that with
our App Store presence,

396
00:18:40.046 --> 00:18:42.256
and App Analytics can
point out those areas.

397
00:18:43.436 --> 00:18:46.886
Finally, after we launch, it's
all about building a better app,

398
00:18:46.886 --> 00:18:49.626
and App Analytics is there
to tell us and point us

399
00:18:49.626 --> 00:18:50.776
in the right direction
to do that.

400
00:18:51.506 --> 00:18:54.386
That is why App Analytics
is important.

401
00:18:54.946 --> 00:18:59.466
So with that, how do we
look at this at Apple?

402
00:18:59.466 --> 00:19:01.626
How are we looking at App
Analytics as a product

403
00:18:59.466 --> 00:19:01.626
How are we looking at App
Analytics as a product

404
00:19:01.626 --> 00:19:03.146
in the service for
app developers?

405
00:19:03.556 --> 00:19:06.746
We're focusing on this concept
of the customer lifecycle,

406
00:19:07.996 --> 00:19:10.026
and this involves
acquisition to engagement.

407
00:19:10.026 --> 00:19:11.826
We want you as developers
to be covered

408
00:19:11.826 --> 00:19:13.556
from the point your
app hits the store

409
00:19:13.556 --> 00:19:15.416
to the point your
customers are using the app.

410
00:19:15.506 --> 00:19:17.656
And let's look at that from
the customer's perspective.

411
00:19:18.116 --> 00:19:19.526
And we start with
our first measure.

412
00:19:19.726 --> 00:19:21.516
Here is your App
Store product page.

413
00:19:21.866 --> 00:19:24.586
We have "Trip Guider," an app we
made up for this presentation.

414
00:19:25.586 --> 00:19:27.756
The first thing we see
is App Store views.

415
00:19:27.916 --> 00:19:30.876
We're really excited that for
the first time Apple's providing

416
00:19:30.876 --> 00:19:33.826
you developers with a view
of your App Store Views.

417
00:19:34.106 --> 00:19:34.956
All - thank you.

418
00:19:35.516 --> 00:19:39.806
[ Applause ]

419
00:19:40.306 --> 00:19:41.806
This is data only
Apple can provide.

420
00:19:41.926 --> 00:19:44.466
It comes straight from the
App Store to you developers.

421
00:19:46.356 --> 00:19:48.436
Next we have App
units and sales.

422
00:19:49.426 --> 00:19:52.686
This data here gets tracked any
time a potential customer turns

423
00:19:52.686 --> 00:19:53.916
into an actual customer

424
00:19:54.096 --> 00:19:56.296
and touches your Buy button
inside your product page.

425
00:19:56.766 --> 00:19:58.986
You have this data today
in Sales and Trends

426
00:19:58.986 --> 00:20:01.866
if you're familiar with iTunes
Connect, but this is different.

427
00:19:58.986 --> 00:20:01.866
if you're familiar with iTunes
Connect, but this is different.

428
00:20:02.166 --> 00:20:03.166
We're tying this data

429
00:20:03.166 --> 00:20:05.086
into a complete picture
with App Store views.

430
00:20:05.356 --> 00:20:07.946
For the first time you can
see your App Store views,

431
00:20:08.146 --> 00:20:10.356
and how that drops
for App units.

432
00:20:10.686 --> 00:20:16.036
Next, we've combined App
Store data, Billings data,

433
00:20:16.036 --> 00:20:17.846
and now we have Device data.

434
00:20:18.466 --> 00:20:19.306
We have Installs.

435
00:20:19.686 --> 00:20:22.916
A customer purchases
your application

436
00:20:22.916 --> 00:20:25.026
but they may install
it on multiple devices,

437
00:20:25.086 --> 00:20:28.686
and this is why Installs and App
units are two different metrics.

438
00:20:29.856 --> 00:20:33.376
Once your customer installs the
application and starts engaging,

439
00:20:33.626 --> 00:20:36.286
we have a new world
with device measures.

440
00:20:36.586 --> 00:20:39.236
We have Sessions,
Active devices.

441
00:20:39.846 --> 00:20:40.856
We have Retention.

442
00:20:40.856 --> 00:20:42.866
We have this concept
of Stickiness as well.

443
00:20:43.266 --> 00:20:45.246
Stickiness is great:
It's a single measure

444
00:20:45.246 --> 00:20:48.376
that you can track over time to
insure that you're both growing

445
00:20:48.436 --> 00:20:49.836
and retaining customers.

446
00:20:49.876 --> 00:20:52.536
If there's one measure you want
to look at, it's stickiness.

447
00:20:54.916 --> 00:20:57.976
Finally, if your application
has In-App Purchases,

448
00:20:57.976 --> 00:20:58.926
we track that as well.

449
00:20:58.926 --> 00:21:02.476
For the first time you can see
the entire customer lifecycle

450
00:20:58.926 --> 00:21:02.476
For the first time you can see
the entire customer lifecycle

451
00:21:02.476 --> 00:21:05.476
from the point the user
became a real customer

452
00:21:05.986 --> 00:21:07.816
to when they're converting
on Internet purchases.

453
00:21:08.366 --> 00:21:09.786
This concept of average sales,

454
00:21:09.786 --> 00:21:13.096
if you're using any
business intelligence today,

455
00:21:13.096 --> 00:21:15.446
you may be looking at
average revenue per user.

456
00:21:15.906 --> 00:21:17.006
This is average sales.

457
00:21:17.006 --> 00:21:17.766
We provide that.

458
00:21:17.996 --> 00:21:18.956
This in combination

459
00:21:18.956 --> 00:21:21.026
with stickiness can tell
you a really powerful story

460
00:21:21.306 --> 00:21:24.486
of how your app's doing and how
your customers are performing.

461
00:21:25.046 --> 00:21:27.876
So, that's the customer's
view of this.

462
00:21:27.966 --> 00:21:29.476
Let's look at your
view, the developer.

463
00:21:29.746 --> 00:21:32.636
We have our App Store views,
we have our App Units,

464
00:21:33.236 --> 00:21:35.406
Active Devices, Retention,
In-App Purchases.

465
00:21:35.716 --> 00:21:38.136
This funnel starts to
drop, and that makes sense

466
00:21:38.136 --> 00:21:40.706
because not every
potential customer becomes an

467
00:21:40.706 --> 00:21:41.496
actual customer.

468
00:21:42.026 --> 00:21:46.586
What does this look like when
we start to ask more questions?

469
00:21:46.626 --> 00:21:48.096
How does this look by platform?

470
00:21:48.636 --> 00:21:52.466
We start to filter this data
by iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch.

471
00:21:52.466 --> 00:21:56.406
We can see the composition of
our App Store views across all

472
00:21:56.406 --> 00:21:57.436
of the Apple platforms.

473
00:21:57.826 --> 00:22:02.616
We can also answer that App
Store presence question,

474
00:21:57.826 --> 00:22:02.616
We can also answer that App
Store presence question,

475
00:22:03.046 --> 00:22:04.736
"Should I be localizing
for Germany?"

476
00:22:05.096 --> 00:22:07.226
Here, I can see my
apps reviews in Europe.

477
00:22:07.226 --> 00:22:10.876
It's quite high, but my app
units in Europe, a little lower,

478
00:22:11.396 --> 00:22:12.786
and this makes sense as well,

479
00:22:12.786 --> 00:22:14.256
and there's an opportunity
there.

480
00:22:14.256 --> 00:22:17.596
This is where analytics can help
you reveal missed opportunities.

481
00:22:18.136 --> 00:22:20.166
If we just localize our app,

482
00:22:20.166 --> 00:22:21.746
potentially we can
get more app units

483
00:22:22.026 --> 00:22:25.426
and that will help us get more
active devices, more retention,

484
00:22:25.796 --> 00:22:26.836
more In-App Purchases.

485
00:22:27.236 --> 00:22:29.146
Maybe it's that simple,
and we don't have

486
00:22:29.146 --> 00:22:31.236
to release another
version of our app

487
00:22:31.306 --> 00:22:32.896
to get more downloads
in Germany.

488
00:22:33.466 --> 00:22:36.136
So this is great.

489
00:22:36.706 --> 00:22:38.426
Let's talk about what
it actually looks like

490
00:22:38.426 --> 00:22:40.496
and show you guys what
we've been working on.

491
00:22:40.496 --> 00:22:41.356
I think that's why we're here.

492
00:22:43.486 --> 00:22:45.976
App Analytics shows up as a
new feature inside the new

493
00:22:45.976 --> 00:22:46.686
iTunes Connect.

494
00:22:48.046 --> 00:22:49.746
It's here beside My Apps.

495
00:22:50.996 --> 00:22:52.326
The first view that we see

496
00:22:52.326 --> 00:22:55.606
when we click inside
Analytics is our App List.

497
00:22:55.856 --> 00:22:58.036
This is the older view of
your entire mobile business.

498
00:22:58.416 --> 00:23:00.586
Here, I can see my "Trip
Guider" app at the top.

499
00:22:58.416 --> 00:23:00.586
Here, I can see my "Trip
Guider" app at the top.

500
00:23:00.586 --> 00:23:03.416
I can see all of my
other apps in my suite.

501
00:23:03.626 --> 00:23:05.346
I can see filters.

502
00:23:05.736 --> 00:23:09.526
I can see the ability to
change my time, my date.

503
00:23:10.376 --> 00:23:11.476
Let's look at these metrics.

504
00:23:11.546 --> 00:23:14.016
So, here is the key
vitals for an application.

505
00:23:14.576 --> 00:23:16.016
Going from the left
to the right,

506
00:23:16.056 --> 00:23:17.556
I see that lifecycle again.

507
00:23:17.556 --> 00:23:18.406
It's consistent.

508
00:23:18.636 --> 00:23:20.826
Start with My App Store
views and then My App Units.

509
00:23:21.226 --> 00:23:24.026
I see my Sessions and my Sales.

510
00:23:24.026 --> 00:23:30.016
See if they're rising,
falling in this period.

511
00:23:30.106 --> 00:23:32.336
I hover over these, I get
tool tips telling me what the

512
00:23:32.336 --> 00:23:33.566
previous period was as well.

513
00:23:33.566 --> 00:23:35.496
I can select one.

514
00:23:35.756 --> 00:23:38.176
Selecting one of these brings us
into the heart of this product

515
00:23:38.176 --> 00:23:39.306
which is our Metrics Page.

516
00:23:39.986 --> 00:23:42.006
The first thing you'll
notice is that great trend.

517
00:23:42.076 --> 00:23:43.716
We can see how we're
doing over time

518
00:23:44.156 --> 00:23:46.516
and this situation we're
looking at, data from May.

519
00:23:46.756 --> 00:23:50.336
I can see over May that my
application is increasing

520
00:23:50.336 --> 00:23:51.926
in App Store views,
which is awesome.

521
00:23:52.366 --> 00:23:54.156
I can also change
my interval below.

522
00:23:54.156 --> 00:23:56.746
I can change this from
Days to Weeks to Months.

523
00:23:57.916 --> 00:23:59.406
Let's talk about
those measures again.

524
00:23:59.746 --> 00:24:01.946
Here, I have those
lifecycle metrics.

525
00:23:59.746 --> 00:24:01.946
Here, I have those
lifecycle metrics.

526
00:24:01.946 --> 00:24:04.186
I have my Sales, my Store Data.

527
00:24:04.656 --> 00:24:07.006
I have my Engagement
Data, my Device Data.

528
00:24:07.006 --> 00:24:09.866
I can select any of these
and change the chart.

529
00:24:10.406 --> 00:24:13.406
Let's look at breaking this
down by a particular platform.

530
00:24:13.516 --> 00:24:17.596
I select View By and now I can
see how this actually looks

531
00:24:18.176 --> 00:24:20.306
across all of the Apple devices.

532
00:24:20.306 --> 00:24:24.576
I can see my iPhone, my iPad,
my iPod touch, and it looks

533
00:24:24.576 --> 00:24:26.526
like the trend is about
the same on all of them.

534
00:24:26.526 --> 00:24:27.996
They're all performing
equally in this case.

535
00:24:27.996 --> 00:24:28.386
It's great.

536
00:24:28.986 --> 00:24:31.726
But a customer can't
have an iPhone

537
00:24:31.896 --> 00:24:34.306
and an iPad at the same time.

538
00:24:34.416 --> 00:24:35.516
They're not the same device.

539
00:24:35.516 --> 00:24:36.556
They're two different devices.

540
00:24:36.956 --> 00:24:38.856
So, we look at that
as a stacked area.

541
00:24:39.056 --> 00:24:42.966
I go to Chart Type, I select
Stacked Area, like that.

542
00:24:43.176 --> 00:24:47.436
I can now see the composition
of iPhone, iPod, iPod touch,

543
00:24:47.646 --> 00:24:50.106
and the sum of these
will equal 100 percent

544
00:24:50.106 --> 00:24:51.436
of whatever metric
I'm looking at.

545
00:24:51.756 --> 00:24:54.676
There's different chart types
for different scenarios,

546
00:24:54.866 --> 00:24:59.326
and looking at App Store Views,
here - Area looks the best.

547
00:24:59.526 --> 00:25:01.246
We'll choose the
sensible default based

548
00:24:59.526 --> 00:25:01.246
We'll choose the
sensible default based

549
00:25:01.246 --> 00:25:02.866
on the measure you're
looking at.

550
00:25:04.046 --> 00:25:05.526
Let's swap to another measure.

551
00:25:05.736 --> 00:25:06.846
Look at App Store Units.

552
00:25:07.526 --> 00:25:08.596
Here, there's no issues here.

553
00:25:08.596 --> 00:25:12.616
Analytics is providing an
answer that my conversions

554
00:25:12.616 --> 00:25:16.416
from page views to App Units
hasn't dropped drastically.

555
00:25:16.676 --> 00:25:19.056
It's a little bit lower,
but the trend is the same,

556
00:25:19.236 --> 00:25:20.966
and on both devices
it's the same.

557
00:25:21.376 --> 00:25:23.146
So, not a lot of opportunity

558
00:25:23.146 --> 00:25:26.096
to improve my iPad
App Store presence

559
00:25:26.476 --> 00:25:28.216
because it's performing
the same as my iPhone.

560
00:25:28.216 --> 00:25:29.486
Maybe I improve them
all together.

561
00:25:30.666 --> 00:25:33.026
Let's go to another
measure In-App Purchases,

562
00:25:33.206 --> 00:25:37.256
and this is where our team
decided that on May 15th,

563
00:25:37.656 --> 00:25:39.866
we would lower the price
of In-App Purchases,

564
00:25:40.236 --> 00:25:42.806
and as a result, we got
a lot more app purchases

565
00:25:42.806 --> 00:25:45.566
that occurred, and we can
see that with App Analytics.

566
00:25:45.566 --> 00:25:47.536
We can see the spike there -

567
00:25:47.536 --> 00:25:49.516
we can see that across
all platforms,

568
00:25:49.866 --> 00:25:52.946
it performed much better
as a result of our change.

569
00:25:55.016 --> 00:25:57.786
We also had intuition

570
00:25:57.786 --> 00:26:01.266
that changing our In-App
Purchases would help give more

571
00:25:57.786 --> 00:26:01.266
that changing our In-App
Purchases would help give more

572
00:26:01.266 --> 00:26:03.526
customers more content,
and that would result

573
00:26:03.526 --> 00:26:05.886
in more engagement,
more active devices.

574
00:26:06.596 --> 00:26:10.136
So with that, we select
In-App Purchases, Compare To,

575
00:26:10.136 --> 00:26:15.706
select Active Devices, and now
we see our Active Devices went

576
00:26:15.706 --> 00:26:17.326
up as did our In-App Purchases.

577
00:26:17.326 --> 00:26:18.426
I can see these layer on top

578
00:26:18.426 --> 00:26:21.306
of each other telling
me the story that, "Yes,

579
00:26:21.446 --> 00:26:25.616
our changes to In-App Purchases
really did impact Active Devices

580
00:26:25.616 --> 00:26:26.006
as well."

581
00:26:26.296 --> 00:26:28.566
We've got more revenue
from our In-App Purchases,

582
00:26:28.886 --> 00:26:31.766
and we've got more
retention and more engagement

583
00:26:31.766 --> 00:26:32.856
from our Active Devices.

584
00:26:33.306 --> 00:26:38.146
So, that's Metrics, and that's
the measures that we provide.

585
00:26:38.326 --> 00:26:40.196
There's some questions
we haven't answered yet,

586
00:26:40.686 --> 00:26:43.456
and we're going to
answer that with Sources.

587
00:26:43.986 --> 00:26:45.226
So, what are Sources?

588
00:26:45.716 --> 00:26:48.826
Sources are all about
how people find your app.

589
00:26:49.406 --> 00:26:51.996
As developers, you work
really hard on your app,

590
00:26:51.996 --> 00:26:56.056
your App Store presence, and
you have no idea right now how

591
00:26:56.056 --> 00:26:57.686
people are getting to
your App Store page.

592
00:26:58.096 --> 00:27:00.296
We're excited that Sources
solves that problem.

593
00:26:58.096 --> 00:27:00.296
We're excited that Sources
solves that problem.

594
00:27:01.076 --> 00:27:02.656
There's two types.

595
00:27:03.336 --> 00:27:07.386
We have websites, and
we have campaigns.

596
00:27:07.456 --> 00:27:08.726
Websites are really simple.

597
00:27:08.726 --> 00:27:10.246
It's a link to your
App Store page.

598
00:27:10.246 --> 00:27:11.756
You're familiar with
these links today.

599
00:27:11.756 --> 00:27:14.646
Any time you hand a link to
your friends, to your family,

600
00:27:14.646 --> 00:27:18.026
to your marketing sites, that
link is now trapped in the form

601
00:27:18.026 --> 00:27:21.446
of a website as a refer,
as a Source, and we can see

602
00:27:21.446 --> 00:27:22.676
that in App Analytics.

603
00:27:23.636 --> 00:27:26.756
And Campaigns are that same
link with the campaign ID.

604
00:27:27.246 --> 00:27:29.086
This is a friendly
link - friendly name

605
00:27:29.086 --> 00:27:30.366
that you supply to the URL.

606
00:27:30.806 --> 00:27:32.076
Let's talk about
what that looks like.

607
00:27:32.676 --> 00:27:33.366
It's really simple.

608
00:27:33.456 --> 00:27:35.706
This is the URL that
hopefully you're familiar with.

609
00:27:36.046 --> 00:27:39.006
We add a Provider ID.

610
00:27:39.006 --> 00:27:41.946
We get this Provider ID
inside iTunes Connect,

611
00:27:41.946 --> 00:27:44.576
and then you add
your Campaign ID.

612
00:27:45.356 --> 00:27:47.346
Friendly Name, you want
it as friendly as possible

613
00:27:47.346 --> 00:27:49.936
because you're going to
view this name afterwards -

614
00:27:49.936 --> 00:27:53.166
we'll show you that in a second
- inside your Sources Lists.

615
00:27:54.316 --> 00:27:56.176
If you're using iAd today

616
00:27:56.176 --> 00:27:58.816
to advertise your
application, this is automatic.

617
00:27:58.956 --> 00:28:03.086
You do not have to go to iAd
and set up campaign names

618
00:27:58.956 --> 00:28:03.086
You do not have to go to iAd
and set up campaign names

619
00:28:03.376 --> 00:28:05.006
for the purposes
of App Analytics.

620
00:28:05.326 --> 00:28:06.916
It will all happen seamlessly.

621
00:28:07.176 --> 00:28:10.096
Any campaign you create in iAd
will be automatically tracked

622
00:28:10.096 --> 00:28:12.666
and available inside
App Analytics

623
00:28:12.826 --> 00:28:14.546
and you can really
see the effectiveness

624
00:28:14.546 --> 00:28:17.236
of that inside App
Analytics without any effort.

625
00:28:17.286 --> 00:28:19.706
So what does this look like?

626
00:28:20.126 --> 00:28:21.636
Come here, we select Sources

627
00:28:22.106 --> 00:28:24.946
and get brought to
the Sources Lists.

628
00:28:25.186 --> 00:28:27.086
Here, I see my Top Websites.

629
00:28:27.376 --> 00:28:29.146
Beside that I can
see Top Campaigns.

630
00:28:29.576 --> 00:28:31.836
I have the same key
vitals that I had

631
00:28:31.836 --> 00:28:33.316
on my application list as well.

632
00:28:33.566 --> 00:28:36.876
We're really trying to reinforce
the story of acquisition

633
00:28:36.876 --> 00:28:39.456
to engagement and keep it
consistent for you guys.

634
00:28:39.856 --> 00:28:43.446
I select Top Campaigns.

635
00:28:43.446 --> 00:28:45.276
I get brought over to
my Top Campaigns List.

636
00:28:45.276 --> 00:28:48.536
These are a view of all those
friendly names that we set up.

637
00:28:49.116 --> 00:28:50.716
Let's zoom in on
one of these here.

638
00:28:50.836 --> 00:28:52.296
I can see "Spring Email Blast."

639
00:28:52.336 --> 00:28:53.286
That was my friendly name.

640
00:28:53.746 --> 00:28:56.756
I see My App Store
views, my units, my sales,

641
00:28:56.756 --> 00:28:58.776
and my sessions,
that same lifecycle.

642
00:28:59.886 --> 00:29:00.516
This is great.

643
00:28:59.886 --> 00:29:00.516
This is great.

644
00:29:00.516 --> 00:29:03.896
We select that, and we're
into this Source Details.

645
00:29:04.296 --> 00:29:05.886
We think that if
you're marketers,

646
00:29:05.886 --> 00:29:06.916
you're going to love this page.

647
00:29:06.916 --> 00:29:07.926
You're going to sit
on this page.

648
00:29:07.926 --> 00:29:09.346
You're going to share
it with your colleagues.

649
00:29:10.496 --> 00:29:12.456
We can see all of
those key measures.

650
00:29:12.456 --> 00:29:13.316
It's a nice visual.

651
00:29:13.316 --> 00:29:15.396
We see it broken down
over time as well.

652
00:29:15.576 --> 00:29:17.616
Every day has a bar
on these Key Measures.

653
00:29:17.866 --> 00:29:19.456
We also see additional measures

654
00:29:19.456 --> 00:29:21.826
that you can only get
on the Metrics Page.

655
00:29:22.356 --> 00:29:26.936
You can see this broken down by
different data types as well.

656
00:29:26.936 --> 00:29:29.476
So, here we're looking for
App Store views by Region,

657
00:29:29.506 --> 00:29:31.466
by Territory, by Platform.

658
00:29:32.086 --> 00:29:34.226
Changing those dropdowns,
I can change the measure

659
00:29:34.226 --> 00:29:36.826
that I'm looking at and see
exactly how this campaign is

660
00:29:36.826 --> 00:29:39.686
performing, how this
website is performing,

661
00:29:40.026 --> 00:29:43.146
and what exactly the
customers are doing as well.

662
00:29:43.676 --> 00:29:47.146
So that's Sources.

663
00:29:47.146 --> 00:29:49.236
We think that you're going
to love Sources today.

664
00:29:49.236 --> 00:29:51.256
You know that people are
downloading your app,

665
00:29:51.346 --> 00:29:52.096
installing the app.

666
00:29:52.396 --> 00:29:53.906
What you don't know is
where they're coming from,

667
00:29:53.906 --> 00:29:55.496
and we're solving that problem.

668
00:29:56.846 --> 00:29:59.956
So, we've answered the question,
how are people doing in the app?

669
00:29:59.956 --> 00:30:01.926
Are they converting
on Internet purchases?

670
00:29:59.956 --> 00:30:01.926
Are they converting
on Internet purchases?

671
00:30:02.016 --> 00:30:02.906
Where are they coming from?

672
00:30:03.466 --> 00:30:06.656
We haven't answered in
detail, "Are people returning

673
00:30:06.656 --> 00:30:07.936
or are they retained?"

674
00:30:08.326 --> 00:30:10.156
What does that side of
the lifecycle look like?

675
00:30:10.466 --> 00:30:11.966
And we answer that
with retention.

676
00:30:12.706 --> 00:30:15.636
Let's just do a quick education

677
00:30:15.636 --> 00:30:17.096
on retention, why
it's important.

678
00:30:17.636 --> 00:30:18.816
This is obvious.

679
00:30:18.816 --> 00:30:21.266
One-hundred percent of your
customers are customers

680
00:30:21.266 --> 00:30:22.136
on the purchased date.

681
00:30:22.536 --> 00:30:23.376
It's really simple.

682
00:30:23.856 --> 00:30:29.796
Moving along, 45 percent
are customers on Day 2,

683
00:30:30.426 --> 00:30:33.866
35 percent on Day 7, and
20 percent on Day 30.

684
00:30:34.006 --> 00:30:35.816
Hopefully these numbers
aren't scary,

685
00:30:36.626 --> 00:30:37.836
but there's an opportunity
there.

686
00:30:37.966 --> 00:30:40.596
You can get them higher
and higher - focus on this,

687
00:30:40.596 --> 00:30:42.916
it's really important because
if you have no more customers

688
00:30:42.916 --> 00:30:46.906
at Day 30 or 90, you're
really going to have to focus

689
00:30:46.906 --> 00:30:49.466
on the next stop or
improving your content

690
00:30:49.466 --> 00:30:50.456
in your marketing to get more.

691
00:30:50.996 --> 00:30:53.796
How do we show this in the UI?

692
00:30:54.186 --> 00:30:57.216
Select retention, and I
can see my purchase date

693
00:30:57.216 --> 00:30:58.976

694
00:31:00.116 --> 00:31:01.866
I can see my days
later on the right.

695
00:31:02.076 --> 00:31:06.746
Here I'm looking at Day 7,
and there's a little story.

696
00:31:06.976 --> 00:31:10.786
So of the active devices
that purchase on May 23,

697
00:31:11.326 --> 00:31:14.786
18 percent remained
active seven days later.

698
00:31:14.996 --> 00:31:16.226
This is great - single view

699
00:31:16.226 --> 00:31:18.886
of how my retention
on May 23 was doing.

700
00:31:19.386 --> 00:31:22.436
As developers, as
marketers, product managers,

701
00:31:22.576 --> 00:31:24.386
we want to look at this with all

702
00:31:24.386 --> 00:31:26.416
of our purchase dates
stacked on top of each other.

703
00:31:26.666 --> 00:31:27.806
So that's the view
that we're providing.

now we show you the rest

of this matrix.

706
00:31:33.466 --> 00:31:35.946
So, May 23rd to June 3rd,

707
00:31:35.946 --> 00:31:39.506
I can see my retention
stacked a single quick view

708

of how my Day 7 retention is,

709
00:31:41.916 --> 00:31:45.016
and you don't have
to do anything.

What do you need to do?

Nothing. There's no SDK,
no third party code running

performance degradation.

You don't have to

This is not an Apple provided
library that you have to embed

721
00:32:18.326 --> 00:32:20.436
in your app, and you don't
have to instantiate it,

722
00:32:20.436 --> 00:32:22.686
initialize it, no
code is required,

723
00:32:23.466 --> 00:32:25.116
no app updates required.

724
00:32:25.186 --> 00:32:27.456
You do not have to
recompile, re-sign,

725
00:32:27.456 --> 00:32:28.836
resubmit your app to the store.

726
00:32:29.216 --> 00:32:31.676
You really have to do nothing
to take advantage of this.

00:32:32.616 --> 00:32:34.106
We're doing this
because it's all built

728
00:32:34.106 --> 00:32:36.286
into the App Store and iOS 8.

729
00:32:36.806 --> 00:32:40.346
Everything from the store

And what have we kept in
mind while doing this?

733
00:32:48.376 --> 00:32:52.326
Privacy. So App Analytics has
been a really highly requested

Hi, my name is Daniel Miao.

766
00:34:07.426 --> 00:34:10.626
I'm a Software Engineer
on iTunes Connect.

767
00:34:11.056 --> 00:34:14.186
Now, most of you heard during
Tim's keynote on Monday

768
00:34:14.186 --> 00:34:16.206
that we're announcing
TestFlight Beta Testing.

769
00:34:16.755 --> 00:34:19.346
Well we're very excited to
have this opportunity today

770
00:34:19.346 --> 00:34:21.696
to bring you more details
about this great feature.

771
00:34:23.136 --> 00:34:24.696
Now, before we get started,

772
00:34:24.696 --> 00:34:29.196
how many of you used
TestFlight in the past?

773
00:34:29.376 --> 00:34:33.496
Great. Well whether you've
used TestFlight or not,

774
00:34:33.996 --> 00:34:35.456
I'm sure we can all agree

775
00:34:36.226 --> 00:34:39.485
that great beta testing
tools go a long way.

776
00:34:40.746 --> 00:34:47.206
We'd all like to see less
of these, and more of these.

777
00:34:47.446 --> 00:34:51.576
So before we get into the
details, let's talk a little bit

778
00:34:51.576 --> 00:34:53.866
about the history of
beta distribution.

779
00:34:54.416 --> 00:34:56.775
In the beginning,

780
00:34:57.136 --> 00:35:02.486
beta distribution
looked a lot like this.

781
00:34:57.136 --> 00:35:02.486
beta distribution
looked a lot like this.

782
00:35:04.016 --> 00:35:06.286
Whenever you wanted to test
your app on your device,

783
00:35:06.766 --> 00:35:08.846
you would connect your
device to your computer,

784
00:35:09.186 --> 00:35:11.476
transfer your binary
over and test from there.

785
00:35:12.186 --> 00:35:15.696
At some point you probably
decided it'd be helpful

786
00:35:15.696 --> 00:35:17.496
to have others also take a look

787
00:35:17.496 --> 00:35:19.576
at your app before you
publish it to the App Store.

788
00:35:20.926 --> 00:35:22.556
So each time you
wanted to add a tester,

789
00:35:22.946 --> 00:35:25.196
you would ask the tester
for the device UDID.

790
00:35:25.196 --> 00:35:28.116
You would go to the
developer portal,

791
00:35:28.156 --> 00:35:30.096
set up provisioning profiles.

792
00:35:30.096 --> 00:35:34.346
And then you would send
your tester the binary.

793
00:35:34.346 --> 00:35:36.896
They would connect their
device to their computer,

794
00:35:37.136 --> 00:35:39.656
transfer the binary over,
and they would start testing.

795
00:35:40.006 --> 00:35:41.816
Of course you would
have to do this

796
00:35:41.816 --> 00:35:43.466
for every single
one of your testers.

797
00:35:44.446 --> 00:35:47.436
So, what do we do for
you during this period?

798
00:35:47.596 --> 00:35:50.386
How did we change your beta
distribution experience?

799
00:35:50.776 --> 00:35:54.916

Beta Testing platform,

So let's talk a little bit

00:36:59.986 --> 00:37:02.086
So let's talk a little bit

814
00:37:02.086 --> 00:37:04.556
about the two sides
of the new platform.

815
00:37:05.916 --> 00:37:07.576
You start out in iTunes Connect.

816
00:37:07.576 --> 00:37:09.716
As you work on your project,

817
00:37:09.716 --> 00:37:11.356
you upload your builds
to iTunes Connect.

818
00:37:11.356 --> 00:37:15.156
And from iTunes Connect you
can manage these builds,

819
00:37:16.666 --> 00:37:20.946
manage the testers, distribute
these builds to your testers,

820
00:37:21.566 --> 00:37:25.066
and as they're testing,
you can come back

821
00:37:25.066 --> 00:37:27.246
to get insight into
their activity.

822
00:37:30.376 --> 00:37:33.986
Now once your testers receive
an invitation to TestFlight,

823
00:37:34.826 --> 00:37:40.056
I mean to to test your app, they
download the TestFlight iOS app,

824
00:37:40.056 --> 00:37:43.196
and from here they can
manage what apps they want,

825
00:37:43.196 --> 00:37:43.786
they're testing.

826
00:37:45.526 --> 00:37:47.696
They can perform one-tap
installs and updates,

827
00:37:47.736 --> 00:37:51.546
and they can send you feedback.

828
00:37:53.616 --> 00:37:57.896
So, while we were working on
these features, we discovered

829
00:37:57.896 --> 00:38:01.416
that building great apps
requires a flexible process,

830
00:37:57.896 --> 00:38:01.416
that building great apps
requires a flexible process,

831
00:38:02.226 --> 00:38:05.066
everything from iterating
with your development team

832
00:38:05.066 --> 00:38:07.306
to distributing to
a wider audience,

833
00:38:08.226 --> 00:38:10.766
so we came up with
internal and beta testers.

834
00:38:12.236 --> 00:38:16.326
Now internal testers are made
up of your iTunes Connect users.

835
00:38:16.806 --> 00:38:21.756
A beta tester is anyone
with an email address.

836
00:38:22.106 --> 00:38:26.586
You can have up to 25
internal testers and up

837
00:38:27.436 --> 00:38:30.196
to 1,000 beta testers.

838
00:38:30.416 --> 00:38:35.406
As you upload builds
to iTunes Connect,

839
00:38:35.526 --> 00:38:38.126
your internal testers
will have access

840
00:38:38.126 --> 00:38:43.446
to these builds right away, and
beta app review will be required

841
00:38:43.446 --> 00:38:45.366
to unlock your 1,000 testers.

842
00:38:45.686 --> 00:38:48.736
But while your build is in
review, you can continue

843
00:38:48.736 --> 00:38:51.586
to upload new builds, and your
internal testers can continue

844
00:38:51.586 --> 00:38:53.496
to test, and you can continue

845
00:38:53.496 --> 00:38:55.606
to manage your testers
in iTunes Connect.

for the first time, they'll
automatically have a Sandbox

Account created for them.

851
00:39:11.476 --> 00:39:13.426
What this means is that
you don't need to come

852
00:39:13.426 --> 00:39:15.556
into iTunes Connect anymore
to create test accounts.

853
00:39:16.476 --> 00:39:18.526
We want your testers to be
able to test all aspects

854
00:39:18.526 --> 00:39:21.296
of your application
including in-app purchases.

855
00:39:22.876 --> 00:39:25.706
So let's see what
this all looks like.

856
00:39:27.976 --> 00:39:31.246
Here we are, we're back
on the version page

857
00:39:31.246 --> 00:39:35.376
of the new iTunes Connect, and
you'll notice a Prerelease tab.

858
00:39:35.926 --> 00:39:39.656
If you click this, we'll
see a list of the builds

859
00:39:39.656 --> 00:39:41.016
that we uploaded in Xcode.

860
00:39:41.936 --> 00:39:44.746
So let's say you want to
test build number 103.

861
00:39:45.996 --> 00:39:48.416
In order to do this, we
first have to enter metadata

862
00:39:48.416 --> 00:39:50.826
for our testers so they
have something to see

863
00:39:50.826 --> 00:39:51.916
when they receive
their invitation.

864
00:39:54.576 --> 00:39:59.786
So we click into this build, we
enter things like a description,

865
00:39:59.786 --> 00:40:03.086
and we also tell the
tester what we like them

866
00:39:59.786 --> 00:40:03.086
and we also tell the
tester what we like them

867
00:40:03.086 --> 00:40:08.146
to test specifically
on this build.

868
00:40:08.226 --> 00:40:14.346
After we've had this information
inputted, we hit Save,

869
00:40:14.476 --> 00:40:16.186
and we come back
to the Build List.

870
00:40:16.916 --> 00:40:21.346
Once we're on the Build
List, we come to the corner,

871
00:40:22.426 --> 00:40:25.356
we click the Testing
Switch, turn on testing,

872
00:40:25.356 --> 00:40:28.866
and that build is now available
to our internal testers.

873
00:40:28.866 --> 00:40:33.626
So let's say we want
to upload another build

874
00:40:33.626 --> 00:40:40.406
to our internal testers, keep
entering, maybe upload one more.

875
00:40:41.876 --> 00:40:44.856
Now, we're confident that
105 is a build that we want

876
00:40:44.856 --> 00:40:47.816
to distribute more broadly
to our beta testers.

877
00:40:48.216 --> 00:40:52.166
In order to do this, we
click the Submit button next

878
00:40:52.166 --> 00:40:57.386
to the build, and after review,

879
00:40:58.036 --> 00:41:00.306
this is now also available
to our beta testers.

880
00:40:58.036 --> 00:41:00.306
this is now also available
to our beta testers.

881
00:41:01.336 --> 00:41:04.396
You'll notice here that
there's a 30-day expiration

882
00:41:04.396 --> 00:41:06.386
on this build so we know
exactly when we need

883
00:41:06.386 --> 00:41:08.436
to upload the next
build for our testers.

884
00:41:08.436 --> 00:41:14.416
Now let's take a look at
managing beta testers.

885
00:41:18.856 --> 00:41:20.896
Here we are on the
Beta Testers list.

886
00:41:21.766 --> 00:41:25.046
We see everybody that
we added or invited.

887
00:41:25.856 --> 00:41:26.836
We see what they're doing.

888
00:41:27.476 --> 00:41:29.826
We can see that some of our
testers have installed the app

889
00:41:29.826 --> 00:41:30.966
and they're already testing.

890
00:41:32.316 --> 00:41:34.086
Some of them have
accepted the invite

891
00:41:34.086 --> 00:41:35.536
but haven't installed yet,

892
00:41:36.616 --> 00:41:39.776
and some have not even
accepted the invitations yet.

893
00:41:40.106 --> 00:41:43.046
For the ones who have installed,
we see the latest build

894
00:41:43.046 --> 00:41:43.806
that they've installed.

895
00:41:43.806 --> 00:41:50.006
And if we want to add another
tester, we come up here

896
00:41:50.006 --> 00:41:52.726
to the top, we click
the Plus button,

897
00:41:53.296 --> 00:41:58.686
add a few email addresses,
hit Submit

898
00:41:58.686 --> 00:42:02.036
and those testers
are ready to go.

899
00:41:58.686 --> 00:42:02.036
and those testers
are ready to go.

900
00:42:02.256 --> 00:42:03.536
So that's iTunes Connect side.

901
00:42:04.236 --> 00:42:06.866
Now let's take a look at the
tester experience in iOS.

902
00:42:07.346 --> 00:42:09.756
Here we are on the device.

903
00:42:10.196 --> 00:42:12.696
This is the "Mail" app,
and this is an invitation

904
00:42:12.696 --> 00:42:14.316
that we received
from a developer.

905
00:42:15.156 --> 00:42:17.846
We see the name of the app that
we've been invited to test,

906
00:42:17.846 --> 00:42:21.146
and we see a link that
says, open in TestFlight.

907
00:42:21.146 --> 00:42:24.646
So let's go ahead and tap that.

908
00:42:24.846 --> 00:42:26.826
Here we are in the
TestFlight app;

909
00:42:27.446 --> 00:42:32.786
from here we can install our
app, and once we've done that,

910
00:42:32.786 --> 00:42:35.766
we can just start testing.

911
00:42:35.846 --> 00:42:38.426
Few things to note here
is the Send Feedback link.

912
00:42:39.956 --> 00:42:43.666
You, as a tester, can
tap this to send feedback

913
00:42:43.666 --> 00:42:44.766
to your developer via email.

914
00:42:47.036 --> 00:42:49.076
There's also the What to
Test section, which we talked

915
00:42:49.076 --> 00:42:52.976
about earlier, the developer
telling us what they like us

916
00:42:52.976 --> 00:42:56.976
to test specifically
on the latest build.

917
00:42:57.776 --> 00:43:00.216
Now if we tap the TestFlight
link in the top corner,

918
00:42:57.776 --> 00:43:00.216
Now if we tap the TestFlight
link in the top corner,

919
00:43:00.216 --> 00:43:04.666
this will take us
back to a list of apps

920
00:43:04.666 --> 00:43:05.766
that we're actively testing.

921
00:43:05.826 --> 00:43:09.166
From here we can open any of
these apps, we can take a look

922
00:43:09.166 --> 00:43:10.656
at What to Test notes
and we can look

923
00:43:10.656 --> 00:43:11.716
at the version we're testing.

924
00:43:11.716 --> 00:43:18.416
Now let's go back to the
Home screen for a minute.

925
00:43:18.566 --> 00:43:20.446
Here, we see the
app we've installed,

926
00:43:20.446 --> 00:43:24.066
and we'll see a badge, a little
orange badge next to the name

927
00:43:24.066 --> 00:43:26.946
of the app that we
just installed.

928
00:43:27.126 --> 00:43:29.796
This indicates that this app
is currently being tested;

929
00:43:29.796 --> 00:43:33.646
it's a beta build of the app.

930
00:43:33.916 --> 00:43:35.216
And oh, what's this?

931
00:43:35.986 --> 00:43:36.916
We got a notification.

932
00:43:36.916 --> 00:43:40.076
This is telling us that
there's a new build available

933
00:43:40.076 --> 00:43:40.776
for us to test.

934
00:43:41.696 --> 00:43:45.916
So if you tap that,
it'll take us back

935
00:43:45.916 --> 00:43:47.826
into the app, into TestFlight.

936
00:43:48.596 --> 00:43:54.216
From here we can update the
app, and we're on our way.

937
00:43:54.216 --> 00:43:59.546
And that's TestFlight,
the iOS App.

938
00:44:01.516 --> 00:44:05.856
So in summary, we can have
up to 1,000 testers for each

939
00:44:05.856 --> 00:44:09.446
of our apps with beta testing.

940
00:44:09.446 --> 00:44:12.676
We no longer need to manage
UDID's or provisioning profiles.

941
00:44:13.156 --> 00:44:16.766
We can perform one-tap
installs and updates.

942
00:44:20.136 --> 00:44:22.936
Sandbox Accounts are
automatically created

943
00:44:24.386 --> 00:44:26.386
for our testers to be able
to test, and our purchases,

944
00:44:26.496 --> 00:44:30.616
and is all new TestFlight
for iOS.

945
00:44:30.746 --> 00:44:34.126
And that's Beta Testing.

946
00:44:34.566 --> 00:44:35.966
Back to Dave.

947
00:44:36.516 --> 00:44:43.406
[ Applause ]

948
00:44:43.906 --> 00:44:45.526
>> All right, thank you Daniel.

949
00:44:46.096 --> 00:44:51.836
We have a few things to wrap
up here before we conclude.

950
00:44:51.906 --> 00:44:55.366
Every year we ask App
Review if you had a few tips

951
00:44:55.366 --> 00:44:57.016
and tricks we can
give to developers

952
00:44:57.576 --> 00:44:59.846
at a developers' conference,
what would they be?

953
00:45:00.646 --> 00:45:02.286
App Review does a great job.

954
00:45:02.286 --> 00:45:04.116
I looked right before
I got on stage.

955
00:45:04.186 --> 00:45:07.276
Ninety-four percent of all
updates review within five days.

956
00:45:08.076 --> 00:45:09.306
And here are some suggestions

957
00:45:09.306 --> 00:45:13.476
that can help get your
app through app review.

958
00:45:13.646 --> 00:45:15.836
Number 1, app name
versus keywords:

959
00:45:17.186 --> 00:45:20.256
Your app name is not place to
list all those different words

960
00:45:20.256 --> 00:45:23.086
that you want people to search
on so they can find your app.

961
00:45:23.746 --> 00:45:27.086
That's what keywords are for.

962
00:45:27.266 --> 00:45:32.766
IDFA, if you serve ads, then
ads must be present in your app.

963
00:45:34.996 --> 00:45:38.256
The description and screenshots
must match your app -

964
00:45:38.686 --> 00:45:41.266
and I would add to this -
App Preview will probably be

965
00:45:41.266 --> 00:45:42.076
on this list next year.

966
00:45:43.556 --> 00:45:45.166
When you're ready to
submit In-App Purchases

967
00:45:45.306 --> 00:45:47.606
for review you need to
make sure that all aspects

968
00:45:47.606 --> 00:45:48.656
of the In-App Purchase work.

969
00:45:49.226 --> 00:45:50.656
If you need a service
up and running

970
00:45:50.656 --> 00:45:53.156
so the auto renewables work,
that needs to be ready,

971
00:45:54.616 --> 00:45:56.696
not when your In-App Purchase
is live on the App Store

972
00:45:56.696 --> 00:45:58.686
but when you submit
it to App Review.

973
00:45:59.996 --> 00:46:01.636
If your app gets
metadata rejected,

974
00:45:59.996 --> 00:46:01.636
If your app gets
metadata rejected,

975
00:46:02.786 --> 00:46:05.026
and you submit it again
without making a change

976
00:46:05.026 --> 00:46:09.366
to that metadata, it will just
get rejected a second time.

977
00:46:09.546 --> 00:46:13.416
I say that because they say it
happens - just a friendly note.

978
00:46:14.886 --> 00:46:17.826
As always, make sure you have
rights for all the content,

979
00:46:17.976 --> 00:46:19.386
the keywords in your app.

980
00:46:20.466 --> 00:46:23.426
This would apply to screenshots,
app previews, anything.

981
00:46:23.966 --> 00:46:26.396
And lastly, testing.

982
00:46:27.436 --> 00:46:30.426
I'm very happy this
has lowered itself

983
00:46:30.426 --> 00:46:31.466
down on the list this year.

984
00:46:31.996 --> 00:46:37.126
One thing of note is that, if
you're building an iPhone app,

985
00:46:37.746 --> 00:46:39.836
it needs to also
work on an iPad.

986
00:46:40.386 --> 00:46:44.846
Not to be outdone, the Apps
Mission Team said, "Hey,

987
00:46:44.846 --> 00:46:48.636
we have some suggestions, want
to help people some things

988
00:46:48.636 --> 00:46:52.916
to think about before they
submit their app to App Review".

989
00:46:52.916 --> 00:46:55.426
IDFA again - answers
these questions correctly

990
00:46:55.426 --> 00:46:56.176
in iTunes Connect.

991
00:46:56.826 --> 00:46:58.386
If you serve ads using IDFA,

992
00:46:58.386 --> 00:47:01.686
make sure you answer those
questions the right way.

993
00:46:58.386 --> 00:47:01.686
make sure you answer those
questions the right way.

994
00:47:03.046 --> 00:47:04.266
We get a fair number
of apps delivered

995
00:47:04.266 --> 00:47:05.556
but don't have all
the right icons.

996
00:47:06.546 --> 00:47:08.456
Make sure all your
required icons are

997
00:47:08.456 --> 00:47:10.346
in your project before
you submit.

998
00:47:11.676 --> 00:47:13.666
Toolchains and bad signature:

999
00:47:14.076 --> 00:47:17.656
These kinds of invalid binary
messages can all be solved

1000
00:47:17.656 --> 00:47:20.956
by making sure that you
upload and create your app

1001
00:47:21.236 --> 00:47:23.526
in the latest version of Xcode.

1002
00:47:24.186 --> 00:47:26.696
And Mac app sandboxing, if
you're going to send a Mac

1003
00:47:26.696 --> 00:47:29.196
out to the App Store, make
sure you check that box

1004
00:47:29.196 --> 00:47:31.066
in Xcode before doing so.

1005
00:47:31.626 --> 00:47:35.466
A little note about
iTunes Connect for iOS:

1006
00:47:35.466 --> 00:47:38.696
I hope many of you already
gotten the latest update;

1007
00:47:38.696 --> 00:47:39.896
we released it a few weeks ago.

1008
00:47:40.056 --> 00:47:43.456
This was our first foray
or step into the redesign.

1009
00:47:43.896 --> 00:47:47.926
Updated pages, sells and trends.

1010
00:47:48.366 --> 00:47:51.156
Take a look at your five
week, your two week,

1011
00:47:51.156 --> 00:47:54.096
your 26 weeks information.

1012
00:47:54.646 --> 00:47:57.076
New page view.

1013
00:47:57.076 --> 00:47:59.656
iTunes Connect for iOS.

1014
00:47:59.656 --> 00:48:02.376
At the palm of your hand you can
release the latest version live

1015
00:47:59.656 --> 00:48:02.376
At the palm of your hand you can
release the latest version live

1016
00:48:02.376 --> 00:48:03.006
into the App Store.

1017
00:48:06.836 --> 00:48:10.576
So today we talked about the
new design for iTunes Connect;,

1018
00:48:11.836 --> 00:48:17.096
a nice new UI as well as
cleaner flows; app previews,

1019
00:48:17.496 --> 00:48:20.616
15 to 30 seconds
of dynamic video

1020
00:48:21.286 --> 00:48:23.166
so you can show what
makes your app magical.

1021
00:48:23.716 --> 00:48:28.856
App bundles: Bundle up to
10 of your apps together,

1022
00:48:30.146 --> 00:48:33.156
providing people in the
App Store with one install

1023
00:48:33.156 --> 00:48:34.736
to get all of these apps.

1024
00:48:35.906 --> 00:48:39.676
App Analytics - this is the
best end-to-end view of your app

1025
00:48:39.896 --> 00:48:41.996
with data that only
Apple can provide.

1026
00:48:43.256 --> 00:48:44.476
And TestFlight Beta Testing.

1027
00:48:44.996 --> 00:48:47.856
If you haven't been beta
testing your apps until now,

1028
00:48:47.856 --> 00:48:51.056
you have no reason not to.

1029
00:48:51.276 --> 00:48:53.226
Just like iOS 8 and
OS X Yosemite,

1030
00:48:53.736 --> 00:48:55.926
these features will be
released later this fall.

1031
00:48:57.396 --> 00:48:59.526
For more information,
you can write to write

1032
00:48:59.526 --> 00:49:01.066
to evangelism@apple.com.

1033
00:48:59.526 --> 00:49:01.066
to evangelism@apple.com.

1034
00:49:01.756 --> 00:49:03.466
There's a Contact Us
form on iTunes Connect -

1035
00:49:04.016 --> 00:49:05.336
this really is the best way

1036
00:49:05.336 --> 00:49:07.246
to get your questions
answered by the right person.

1037
00:49:07.436 --> 00:49:08.526
It can take a lot time

1038
00:49:08.526 --> 00:49:10.616
to navigate those
emails based off your

1039
00:49:10.616 --> 00:49:12.346
questions appropriately.

1040
00:49:13.126 --> 00:49:15.466
There's iTunes Connect
Dev Guide you can get

1041
00:49:15.466 --> 00:49:19.366
on developer.apple.com as
well as the dev forms -

1042
00:49:19.676 --> 00:49:20.566
lots of good information there.

1043
00:49:22.056 --> 00:49:24.726
We have some related
sessions later today:

1044
00:49:24.726 --> 00:49:26.046
"Optimizing In-App Purchases."

1045
00:49:26.046 --> 00:49:28.006
If you have any questions
on how exactly

1046
00:49:28.006 --> 00:49:29.956
to use In-App Purchases,
check that out.

1047
00:49:30.696 --> 00:49:32.186
"What's New in iAd Workbench."

1048
00:49:32.706 --> 00:49:37.226
As Trystan mentioned, privacy
matters, so we have a session

1049
00:49:37.226 --> 00:49:41.556
on "User Privacy
in iOS and OS X."

1050
00:49:41.796 --> 00:49:43.486
Tomorrow, "Advanced
User Interfaces

1051
00:49:43.486 --> 00:49:44.436
With Collection Views."

1052
00:49:44.776 --> 00:49:46.726
This is a great session
where we'll talk about that

1053
00:49:46.726 --> 00:49:50.146
and show how we used it in
creating iTunes Connect for iOS.

1054
00:49:51.366 --> 00:49:53.036
And the session I
mentioned earlier about

1055
00:49:53.036 --> 00:49:54.216
"Creating Great App Previews,"

1056
00:49:54.606 --> 00:49:56.006
again right before
the bash tomorrow.

1057
00:49:56.006 --> 00:49:57.626
I encourage you to check
that one out as well.

1058
00:49:58.656 --> 00:49:59.766
And with that, that's
all we have today,

1059
00:49:59.766 --> 00:50:00.856
I hope you have a great day
and rest of the conference.

1060
00:49:59.766 --> 00:50:00.856
I hope you have a great day
and rest of the conference.

1061
00:50:00.856 --> 00:50:00.923
Bye.

1062
00:50:01.516 --> 00:50:03.973
[ Applause ]

1063
00:50:04.473 --> 00:50:06.930
.
