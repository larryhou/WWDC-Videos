1
00:00:11.296 --> 00:00:11.796
>> Good morning.

2
00:00:12.096 --> 00:00:14.736
Welcome to session 702
Managing Apple Devices.

3
00:00:15.516 --> 00:00:18.236
[ Applause ]

4
00:00:18.736 --> 00:00:20.446
Wow. I wasn't expecting
that enthusiastic

5
00:00:20.446 --> 00:00:21.846
of welcome this early
in the morning.

6
00:00:22.546 --> 00:00:24.636
I'm Todd Fernandez, and I
am very happy to be here

7
00:00:24.636 --> 00:00:26.806
with you even at this
ridiculously early hour

8
00:00:26.896 --> 00:00:27.966
for techies like me.

9
00:00:28.786 --> 00:00:31.296
Although for some of you, this
may be the middle of your day

10
00:00:31.296 --> 00:00:33.066
if you work in schools
our otherwise have

11
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:33.976
to wear a tie to work.

12
00:00:35.256 --> 00:00:37.726
Many of us are far more likely
to see this hour at the end

13
00:00:37.726 --> 00:00:40.276
of a long night of coding than
at the beginning of our day.

14
00:00:41.606 --> 00:00:43.766
Now, I open by recognizing
our differences

15
00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:45.886
because this session's
content is intended

16
00:00:45.886 --> 00:00:47.116
for a diverse audience.

17
00:00:47.116 --> 00:00:50.946
From Indian vendors, who need to
learn how to take full advantage

18
00:00:50.946 --> 00:00:52.926
of the powerful device
management capabilities

19
00:00:52.926 --> 00:00:58.206
that we've built into iOS 8 and
OS X Yosemite, to app developers

20
00:00:58.206 --> 00:01:01.196
who want to understand how their
apps may be used in schools

21
00:00:58.206 --> 00:01:01.196
who want to understand how their
apps may be used in schools

22
00:01:01.196 --> 00:01:04.036
and businesses, to
administrators who need

23
00:01:04.036 --> 00:01:06.946
to know what changes are coming
in the OS releases this year.

24
00:01:08.716 --> 00:01:11.666
When I stood before you here
last year, I was thrilled

25
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:15.176
to announce 2 huge leaps forward
in managing Apple devices.

26
00:01:16.056 --> 00:01:17.966
In the addition of
managed distribution

27
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:21.016
to our Volume Purchase
Program and the introduction

28
00:01:21.016 --> 00:01:23.656
of the Device Enrollment
Program which Craig highlighted

29
00:01:23.656 --> 00:01:25.846
in the enterprise section
of yesterday's Keynote.

30
00:01:25.846 --> 00:01:28.226
It's hard to believe there
was an enterprise section

31
00:01:28.226 --> 00:01:29.976
at the Keynote, but it
was very exciting to see.

32
00:01:30.516 --> 00:01:36.626
[ Applause ]

33
00:01:37.126 --> 00:01:40.116
When we set out to create
the device in Roman program,

34
00:01:40.116 --> 00:01:43.436
we did so after wondering, why
does it have to be painful to do

35
00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:44.716
that initial configuration

36
00:01:44.716 --> 00:01:47.316
of your devices before handing
them out to their users?

37
00:01:48.016 --> 00:01:50.076
And we started by
asking a simple question.

38
00:01:50.886 --> 00:01:54.246
Why can't it be as easy as
just un-boxing that device

39
00:01:54.246 --> 00:01:57.626
and handing that iPad or that
iPhone or that Mac to its user?

40
00:01:57.626 --> 00:02:01.476
And it turns out many of you
are asking the same question.

41
00:01:57.626 --> 00:02:01.476
And it turns out many of you
are asking the same question.

42
00:02:01.946 --> 00:02:05.116
And I'm very pleased to report
that our customers are just

43
00:02:05.116 --> 00:02:06.856
as thrilled by the
transformative nature

44
00:02:06.856 --> 00:02:08.455
of this new service
as we had hoped.

45
00:02:09.606 --> 00:02:12.666
One noteworthy example is
Immaculata La Salle High School

46
00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:16.496
in Florida who believe
that we, indeed,

47
00:02:16.496 --> 00:02:18.056
turned this dream
into a reality.

48
00:02:18.826 --> 00:02:22.296
And they proved it by completely
replacing their fleet of iPads

49
00:02:22.646 --> 00:02:26.826
with 600 new iPad Airs including
restoring all the student apps

50
00:02:26.826 --> 00:02:29.756
and data from iCloud
in 2.5 hours.

51
00:02:30.816 --> 00:02:33.016
They made a wonderful video
showing just how they did it.

52
00:02:33.016 --> 00:02:35.426
And if you've never seen the
Device Enrollment Program

53
00:02:35.426 --> 00:02:37.636
in action, I highly
recommend checking it out.

54
00:02:39.336 --> 00:02:42.996
So since we last met, we've
been very busy launching managed

55
00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:44.336
distribution last fall.

56
00:02:45.346 --> 00:02:47.356
The Device Enrollment
Program a few months ago.

57
00:02:48.536 --> 00:02:53.806
And we've also been busy adding
all these features to fill

58
00:02:53.806 --> 00:02:56.576
in the gaps and smooth
out the inconsistencies

59
00:02:56.576 --> 00:02:58.296
between iOS and OS X.

60
00:02:58.926 --> 00:03:00.256
So that vendors, like some

61
00:02:58.926 --> 00:03:00.256
So that vendors, like some

62
00:03:00.256 --> 00:03:02.516
of you creating device
management tools,

63
00:03:02.816 --> 00:03:04.676
and the administrators,
using those tools,

64
00:03:05.026 --> 00:03:07.896
have a much easier time managing
all their Apple devices.

65
00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:12.546
This session is going to cover
the entire life cycle device

66
00:03:12.546 --> 00:03:15.966
management including both
new tools existing tools

67
00:03:15.966 --> 00:03:18.386
and technologies and
all the changes coming

68
00:03:18.386 --> 00:03:20.716
in iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite.

69
00:03:21.146 --> 00:03:22.946
And we'll show you how
they all come together

70
00:03:22.946 --> 00:03:24.416
to provide a great experience

71
00:03:24.416 --> 00:03:26.936
for both the administrators
and their end users.

72
00:03:27.156 --> 00:03:31.056
From enrolling devices in your
management solution of choice

73
00:03:32.106 --> 00:03:36.226
to distributing content to
all those devices to the day

74
00:03:36.226 --> 00:03:38.136
to day ongoing management
tasks that come

75
00:03:38.136 --> 00:03:40.546
up as time goes on
and needs change.

76
00:03:41.486 --> 00:03:45.056
So let's dive right in and
talk about enrolling devices.

77
00:03:45.906 --> 00:03:47.736
Of course, we're going to
spend a fair amount of time

78
00:03:47.736 --> 00:03:48.946
on the device enrollment
program,

79
00:03:48.946 --> 00:03:50.126
the best way to do this.

80
00:03:50.716 --> 00:03:53.486
I'll also talk about
Apple Configurator

81
00:03:53.486 --> 00:03:55.606
as an alternative way
to enroll your devices.

82
00:03:56.836 --> 00:03:59.826
You also need to be aware of
how to manage Activation Lock

83
00:03:59.826 --> 00:04:01.596
on supervised devices
and be thinking

84
00:03:59.826 --> 00:04:01.596
on supervised devices
and be thinking

85
00:04:01.596 --> 00:04:03.086
about that at enrollment time.

86
00:04:03.606 --> 00:04:06.376
And then I'll conclude
with what's coming

87
00:04:06.376 --> 00:04:08.056
in this year's OS releases.

88
00:04:08.926 --> 00:04:10.826
So before we go any
further, I want to make sure

89
00:04:10.826 --> 00:04:13.576
that everyone understands what
the Device Enrollment Program is

90
00:04:13.576 --> 00:04:14.226
and is not.

91
00:04:14.906 --> 00:04:16.956
So it relates, you know,
audience participation.

92
00:04:16.956 --> 00:04:19.106
Let's get going, although I
appreciate all the responses

93
00:04:19.106 --> 00:04:22.756
already, the Device Enrollment
Program is not a MDM server.

94
00:04:22.856 --> 00:04:23.816
Come on, say it with me,

95
00:04:24.236 --> 00:04:27.146
Device Enrollment Program
is not an MDM server.

96
00:04:27.256 --> 00:04:27.806
Thank you.

97
00:04:28.346 --> 00:04:31.316
Though you'll note they're both
3 letter acronyms, those of you

98
00:04:31.316 --> 00:04:33.726
with eagle eyes with note
they're not the same 3 letters.

99
00:04:35.266 --> 00:04:38.496
In fact, the Device Enrollment
Program is the best way

100
00:04:38.496 --> 00:04:39.966
to get your devices enrolled

101
00:04:39.966 --> 00:04:41.966
in whatever MDM solution
you're going to use.

102
00:04:41.966 --> 00:04:44.926
It's an easy button to get your
devices in your MDM server.

103
00:04:45.566 --> 00:04:50.276
It's really 2 parts: A way
for administrators to specify

104
00:04:50.276 --> 00:04:52.736
which settings they want to use
when their devices are enrolled

105
00:04:52.736 --> 00:04:53.916
in their management solution.

106
00:04:54.456 --> 00:04:58.036
And the integration
of the completion

107
00:04:58.036 --> 00:05:00.436
of that enrollment process
right into the normal set

108
00:04:58.036 --> 00:05:00.436
of that enrollment process
right into the normal set

109
00:05:00.436 --> 00:05:02.656
of assistant process
that the user will go

110
00:05:02.656 --> 00:05:05.666
through on both iOS and OS X.

111
00:05:06.236 --> 00:05:08.746
As I mentioned, we
launched this in February

112
00:05:09.156 --> 00:05:12.656
with devices eligible that
are purchased via direct sales

113
00:05:12.656 --> 00:05:15.826
in the U.S. And we've heard all
of your feedback loud and clear

114
00:05:15.826 --> 00:05:17.326
that you'd like to
see us expanded

115
00:05:17.326 --> 00:05:19.716
to additional countries
and channels.

116
00:05:20.356 --> 00:05:21.266
So I'm very pleased that,

117
00:05:21.266 --> 00:05:23.546
although we've only launched
this a few months ago,

118
00:05:23.916 --> 00:05:26.946
we've already expanded access
to our neighbors to the North.

119
00:05:27.776 --> 00:05:28.946
Any Canadians here?

120
00:05:30.256 --> 00:05:32.826
I'm so sorry about the
Canadians, but, in fact,

121
00:05:32.826 --> 00:05:34.806
the Rangers knocked my Flyers
out in the first round;

122
00:05:34.806 --> 00:05:36.476
so get them next year.

123
00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:41.666
We've also made a number
of other changes already

124
00:05:41.666 --> 00:05:43.656
since launch that I
wanted to point out.

125
00:05:44.356 --> 00:05:47.006
Devices are now eligible
up to 3 years in the past

126
00:05:47.006 --> 00:05:48.566
if you've purchased
them up to 3 years ago.

127
00:05:48.626 --> 00:05:51.556
And there's some enhancements
to the portal that allow you

128
00:05:51.556 --> 00:05:54.736
to set a default MDM server so
that any new device purchases

129
00:05:54.736 --> 00:05:57.066
with automatically be
assigned to that MDM server

130
00:05:57.096 --> 00:05:58.666
without you needing to
take further action.

131
00:05:59.626 --> 00:06:01.876
You can also now see which
administrators assigned

132
00:05:59.626 --> 00:06:01.876
You can also now see which
administrators assigned

133
00:06:01.876 --> 00:06:04.216
which devices to
which MDM servers.

134
00:06:05.656 --> 00:06:08.756
And another, coming soon,
expansion of eligibility is

135
00:06:08.756 --> 00:06:09.906
that when devices that are

136
00:06:09.906 --> 00:06:13.066
in the Device Enrollment
Program are replaced by service,

137
00:06:13.496 --> 00:06:15.796
those devices will
soon be remain

138
00:06:15.796 --> 00:06:18.876
in the Device Enrollment Program
including, retroactively,

139
00:06:19.066 --> 00:06:21.326
devices that have been
replaced over the past 3 years.

140
00:06:21.766 --> 00:06:23.826
We think customers will
really appreciate that too.

141
00:06:25.806 --> 00:06:30.146
So let's quickly recap exactly
how this service works before I

142
00:06:30.146 --> 00:06:32.496
go into details, especially
for the MDM vendors.

143
00:06:33.676 --> 00:06:36.946
Customer purchases devices,
that information is fed

144
00:06:36.946 --> 00:06:38.246
into the Device Enrollment
Program.

145
00:06:40.396 --> 00:06:43.236
When the customer provides
their account information

146
00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:46.276
to their MDM solution, the MDM
solution can download the device

147
00:06:46.276 --> 00:06:47.586
information from the program.

148
00:06:48.326 --> 00:06:50.426
The administrator can then
specify their settings

149
00:06:50.426 --> 00:06:51.826
and upload those to the program.

150
00:06:52.496 --> 00:06:55.896
Then, when users open
the box and start walking

151
00:06:55.896 --> 00:06:59.096
through the setup assistant,
the device receives its settings

152
00:06:59.096 --> 00:07:01.766
from the Device Enrollment
Program which tell it

153
00:06:59.096 --> 00:07:01.766
from the Device Enrollment
Program which tell it

154
00:07:02.146 --> 00:07:03.656
to enroll with the MDM server.

155
00:07:04.186 --> 00:07:05.966
And I also, again, want
to emphasize that once

156
00:07:05.966 --> 00:07:08.986
that happens, Device Enrollment
Program has done its job.

157
00:07:08.986 --> 00:07:09.976
It's out of the picture,

158
00:07:10.136 --> 00:07:12.736
and your MDM solution is the
only thing that's talking

159
00:07:12.736 --> 00:07:13.376
to the devices.

160
00:07:13.376 --> 00:07:19.356
So we're going to talk about
3 topics a few moments here

161
00:07:20.456 --> 00:07:22.566
related to the Device
Enrollment Program and how best

162
00:07:22.566 --> 00:07:24.586
to integrate this into
your MDM solutions.

163
00:07:26.656 --> 00:07:30.706
So the first concept is, where
should the ultimate repository

164
00:07:30.706 --> 00:07:33.336
of the truth relating to
the program, the devices

165
00:07:33.336 --> 00:07:34.836
and the settings reside?

166
00:07:36.216 --> 00:07:38.546
The device information
should really be

167
00:07:38.546 --> 00:07:40.806
in the Device Enrollment Program
and treat that as the truth.

168
00:07:40.806 --> 00:07:42.276
You can always fetch
that information

169
00:07:42.276 --> 00:07:43.936
from the service
to your MDM server.

170
00:07:44.586 --> 00:07:47.396
But the settings that the
administrator decides to apply

171
00:07:47.396 --> 00:07:48.786
to certain groups of devices,

172
00:07:49.426 --> 00:07:52.986
your server should really treat
itself as the truth for that.

173
00:07:52.986 --> 00:07:55.166
It can always upload new
settings to the program.

174
00:07:56.176 --> 00:08:01.056
One caveat here to keep in mind,
though, is what I explained

175
00:07:56.176 --> 00:08:01.056
One caveat here to keep in mind,
though, is what I explained

176
00:08:01.056 --> 00:08:03.046
on the previous slide: Even

177
00:08:03.046 --> 00:08:05.296
if the administrator
changes the settings that are

178
00:08:05.296 --> 00:08:07.546
in the Device Enrollment
Program for a particular device

179
00:08:07.546 --> 00:08:10.536
or devices, those devices
will not see those settings

180
00:08:10.536 --> 00:08:13.486
until the next time that they go
through activation after wiping

181
00:08:13.486 --> 00:08:15.016
and going back through
the setup assistant.

182
00:08:15.296 --> 00:08:17.336
So if the device is already
enrolled and you happen

183
00:08:17.336 --> 00:08:18.956
to change the setting to
say, Well, now I want it

184
00:08:18.956 --> 00:08:21.016
to be supervised,
that won't take effect

185
00:08:21.016 --> 00:08:24.886
until the next time
the device is set up.

186
00:08:25.066 --> 00:08:25.606
All right.

187
00:08:25.736 --> 00:08:28.676
So disowning devices, you may be
thinking, what does that mean?

188
00:08:28.756 --> 00:08:30.506
Well, this removing a device

189
00:08:30.506 --> 00:08:31.836
from the Device Enrollment
Program.

190
00:08:31.896 --> 00:08:33.236
And I'm here to scare you.

191
00:08:35.936 --> 00:08:38.765
Our recommendation is to
not implement this feature.

192
00:08:39.616 --> 00:08:40.316
Why is that?

193
00:08:40.356 --> 00:08:42.446
Well, and if you're
going to break Rule No.

194
00:08:42.446 --> 00:08:44.756
1, you need to really,

195
00:08:44.756 --> 00:08:46.356
really how many "reallys"
did I put on there?

196
00:08:46.946 --> 00:08:48.976
really make sure they
understand the consequences:

197
00:08:48.976 --> 00:08:51.396
That they will not be able
to undo this action and get

198
00:08:51.396 --> 00:08:52.976
that device back
into the program.

199
00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:55.786
So, again, we recommend
following Rule 1.

200
00:08:55.886 --> 00:08:58.116
All right.

201
00:08:58.116 --> 00:09:01.696
Our final topic is thinking
about the combinations of two

202
00:08:58.116 --> 00:09:01.696
Our final topic is thinking
about the combinations of two

203
00:09:02.096 --> 00:09:04.776
of the specific enrollment
settings that you can configure

204
00:09:04.776 --> 00:09:06.916
for a device: Whether
it's supervised or not,

205
00:09:07.166 --> 00:09:10.026
and whether that MDM
enrollment can be removed or not

206
00:09:10.026 --> 00:09:11.456
by the user on the device.

207
00:09:12.206 --> 00:09:15.776
And there our own Profile
Manager has taken the approach

208
00:09:15.776 --> 00:09:17.566
of not separating
these settings.

209
00:09:17.566 --> 00:09:21.196
That if you choose to supervise
a device, it automatically,

210
00:09:21.196 --> 00:09:24.556
the MDM enrollment is not
removable, that top right box.

211
00:09:25.756 --> 00:09:27.636
The bottom right
box is forbidden.

212
00:09:27.686 --> 00:09:30.016
If you try to upload settings

213
00:09:30.226 --> 00:09:33.026
where the device
is not supervised

214
00:09:33.026 --> 00:09:35.256
and the MDM enrollment is
not removable by the user,

215
00:09:35.776 --> 00:09:37.336
the service will
reject those settings.

216
00:09:38.526 --> 00:09:40.596
The lower left box
may be interesting,

217
00:09:40.716 --> 00:09:43.206
again Profile Manager
doesn't well,

218
00:09:43.206 --> 00:09:44.806
that's what profile manger does

219
00:09:44.806 --> 00:09:46.396
if you don't check
the supervised box

220
00:09:46.396 --> 00:09:47.786
that it's completely open.

221
00:09:47.966 --> 00:09:51.606
It's not supervised; end user
can undo the MDM enrollment.

222
00:09:52.096 --> 00:09:53.676
Those 2 are really
the interesting ones.

223
00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:56.146
The kind of half one in
the upper left is allowed,

224
00:09:56.146 --> 00:09:58.456
but probably not
super interesting

225
00:09:58.456 --> 00:10:00.386
to supervise a device
but still allow the user

226
00:09:58.456 --> 00:10:00.386
to supervise a device
but still allow the user

227
00:10:00.386 --> 00:10:02.066
to un enroll from MDM.

228
00:10:03.676 --> 00:10:06.796
So that's a couple notes about
the Device Enrollment Program.

229
00:10:07.736 --> 00:10:09.656
Let's talk a bit about
Apple Configurator.

230
00:10:10.616 --> 00:10:13.936
So again Apple Configurator
is also not an MDM server.

231
00:10:13.936 --> 00:10:15.596
I want to make sure
everyone's clear about that.

232
00:10:15.936 --> 00:10:20.106
But it is an alternative way
to install enrollment settings

233
00:10:20.106 --> 00:10:22.356
on a particular iOS
device over USB.

234
00:10:22.356 --> 00:10:25.206
As an alternative to using
Device Enrollment Program

235
00:10:25.206 --> 00:10:25.776
over the Air.

236
00:10:27.186 --> 00:10:29.276
Once those settings have
been loaded to the device,

237
00:10:29.786 --> 00:10:32.186
the actual requests that
go to the MDM server

238
00:10:32.186 --> 00:10:34.716
to complete the enrollment
are indistinguishable

239
00:10:34.716 --> 00:10:37.406
from whether they were
done the settings got there

240
00:10:37.406 --> 00:10:38.866
over the Air or over USB.

241
00:10:39.846 --> 00:10:42.456
However, you can teach
your server to distinguish

242
00:10:42.456 --> 00:10:44.586
between the 2 if
you check to see

243
00:10:44.586 --> 00:10:48.486
if that particular device
that's enrolling is in the list

244
00:10:48.486 --> 00:10:50.316
that you've gotten from the
Device Enrollment Program.

245
00:10:51.696 --> 00:10:54.656
Also, if a device has
already gotten its settings

246
00:10:54.656 --> 00:10:56.056
from the Device Enrollment
Program,

247
00:10:56.056 --> 00:10:58.376
Configurator will not
overwrite those settings.

248
00:10:59.486 --> 00:11:01.716
One additional caveat is

249
00:10:59.486 --> 00:11:01.716
One additional caveat is

250
00:11:01.716 --> 00:11:04.156
that delivering your enrollment
settings via the Device

251
00:11:04.156 --> 00:11:06.036
Enrollment Program
is the only way

252
00:11:06.036 --> 00:11:08.216
that you can make your MDM
enrollment not removable

253
00:11:08.216 --> 00:11:08.896
by the user.

254
00:11:10.776 --> 00:11:13.676
Another recommendation and
one that we followed ourselves

255
00:11:13.676 --> 00:11:16.216
in Profile Manager is that
it's probably a good idea

256
00:11:16.216 --> 00:11:17.916
to offer administrators
the option

257
00:11:17.916 --> 00:11:22.606
to disallow installing settings
over USB if you want to ensure

258
00:11:22.606 --> 00:11:25.636
that they only get your
institution's devices only get

259
00:11:25.636 --> 00:11:27.946
the settings that
you specify via DEP.

260
00:11:28.676 --> 00:11:32.046
That would present a user
from using Configurator

261
00:11:32.046 --> 00:11:36.436
to install settings that allow
enrollment in your MDM server

262
00:11:36.436 --> 00:11:37.876
without supervising for example.

263
00:11:38.416 --> 00:11:41.706
Let's now talk a little bit

264
00:11:41.706 --> 00:11:43.186
about Activation
Lock Management.

265
00:11:43.966 --> 00:11:47.496
So by default a supervised
device does not allow the user

266
00:11:47.496 --> 00:11:50.786
to enroll in or to
enable Activation Lock.

267
00:11:52.156 --> 00:11:57.656
But there is now a way that
we introduced in the spring

268
00:11:58.266 --> 00:12:03.446
that MDM can request a bypass
code that allows the MDM server

269
00:11:58.266 --> 00:12:03.446
that MDM can request a bypass
code that allows the MDM server

270
00:12:03.446 --> 00:12:06.226
to later or the administrator
to later clear Activation Lock

271
00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:08.016
without needing the
user's password.

272
00:12:08.576 --> 00:12:12.066
At that time, there's
also a MDM command

273
00:12:12.066 --> 00:12:14.926
that can tell the device, well,
okay, now you can allow the user

274
00:12:14.926 --> 00:12:16.076
to enable Activation Lock.

275
00:12:16.076 --> 00:12:18.716
So you want to do all of
this at enrollment time.

276
00:12:18.916 --> 00:12:21.446
If, in fact, your institution
wants to use Activation Lock,

277
00:12:21.446 --> 00:12:22.946
which is a great feature.

278
00:12:24.766 --> 00:12:27.006
We also recommend
that once you retrieve

279
00:12:27.006 --> 00:12:30.856
that Activation Lock bypass
code that you provide access

280
00:12:30.856 --> 00:12:33.866
to the administrator to in the
UI because it may be useful

281
00:12:33.866 --> 00:12:35.586
to maybe enter it
manually on a device

282
00:12:35.586 --> 00:12:38.076
that for whatever reason
is not currently reachable

283
00:12:38.166 --> 00:12:39.226
by the MDM server.

284
00:12:40.656 --> 00:12:44.416
There are 3 new MDM commands
to retrieve the code,

285
00:12:45.016 --> 00:12:46.356
to then delete it
from the device

286
00:12:46.356 --> 00:12:48.766
so that no one can
grab it off the device

287
00:12:48.766 --> 00:12:51.866
if they get physical access
to it, and then, of course,

288
00:12:51.866 --> 00:12:54.936
to enable or allow the device
to enable Activation Lock.

289
00:12:55.696 --> 00:12:56.656
And we strongly recommend

290
00:12:56.656 --> 00:12:58.996
that when you're completing
the MDM enrollment, that,

291
00:12:58.996 --> 00:13:00.816
at that time, you
always retrieve

292
00:12:58.996 --> 00:13:00.816
at that time, you
always retrieve

293
00:13:00.816 --> 00:13:03.196
and then clear the bypass
code from the device

294
00:13:03.536 --> 00:13:05.446
because it's only
available for 15 days

295
00:13:05.446 --> 00:13:06.916
after the device was supervised.

296
00:13:07.356 --> 00:13:10.756
You should also save
that bypass code even

297
00:13:10.756 --> 00:13:13.336
if a particular device
is un-enrolled from MDM

298
00:13:13.506 --> 00:13:15.796
because Activation Lock
may still be enabled.

299
00:13:15.796 --> 00:13:17.166
And you may still
need to clear it.

300
00:13:17.626 --> 00:13:19.646
And the device can
later re enroll.

301
00:13:19.646 --> 00:13:22.396
And there won't be another
opportunity to get a bypass code

302
00:13:22.566 --> 00:13:25.376
until the device is
wiped and re supervised.

303
00:13:25.816 --> 00:13:30.596
So those are the topics I
wanted to cover on enrolling.

304
00:13:30.596 --> 00:13:34.156
But I'm also happy to tell you
that there's important change

305
00:13:34.156 --> 00:13:35.966
in how the device responds

306
00:13:36.556 --> 00:13:39.206
when the enrollment is being
completed in Setup Assistant.

307
00:13:39.776 --> 00:13:42.636
And I know your servers
are all real excited.

308
00:13:42.636 --> 00:13:45.186
The administrators have no
doubt specified lots of settings

309
00:13:45.186 --> 00:13:46.536
and apps and all
sorts of things.

310
00:13:46.536 --> 00:13:48.506
They want to deliver to the
device as soon as it's enrolled;

311
00:13:49.126 --> 00:13:51.136
however, the device
isn't ready to respond

312
00:13:51.136 --> 00:13:53.526
to all those requests while
the user is still completing

313
00:13:53.526 --> 00:13:54.286
Setup Assistant.

314
00:13:54.846 --> 00:13:57.336
So now when any of these
MDM commands are sent

315
00:13:57.336 --> 00:14:00.006
to the device while it is
still in the Setup Assistant,

316
00:13:57.336 --> 00:14:00.006
to the device while it is
still in the Setup Assistant,

317
00:14:00.006 --> 00:14:02.086
it will return the
"not now" status.

318
00:14:02.086 --> 00:14:04.386
So your server can know,
hey, device isn't ready.

319
00:14:04.386 --> 00:14:07.656
I'm going to wait until
it returns success

320
00:14:07.656 --> 00:14:08.326
for that enrollment.

321
00:14:08.756 --> 00:14:12.366
And then you can start
completing your enrollment tasks

322
00:14:12.506 --> 00:14:14.856
or configuration tasks.

323
00:14:15.136 --> 00:14:17.386
So without further ado, I'd
like to show you how this works,

324
00:14:17.386 --> 00:14:20.336
and I'm going to invite my
colleagues Jussi Pekka and Mark

325
00:14:20.336 --> 00:14:22.946
up to show you a demo
of enrolling devices.

326
00:14:24.516 --> 00:14:26.726
[ Applause ]

327
00:14:27.226 --> 00:14:27.716
>> All right, thank you, Todd.

328
00:14:27.716 --> 00:14:31.396
So here we have an out of box,
freshly delivered, new iPad.

329
00:14:31.896 --> 00:14:35.806
Basically it was purchased by
the institution and it didn't go

330
00:14:35.806 --> 00:14:36.706
through some boiler room.

331
00:14:36.786 --> 00:14:38.276
It was just handed
straight to the user

332
00:14:38.646 --> 00:14:41.526
and our Profile Manager
server this is our MDM server

333
00:14:41.526 --> 00:14:45.116
for this demo knows about
this device because the time

334
00:14:45.116 --> 00:14:47.646
between Device Enrollment
Program and Profile Manager

335
00:14:47.916 --> 00:14:50.416
and the device the purchase
was made through the channels.

336
00:14:50.686 --> 00:14:53.906
So we know that this device is
configured for our services.

337
00:14:54.166 --> 00:14:56.916
So I'm going to walk
through the setup as usual.

338
00:14:56.916 --> 00:14:57.956
I'm going to pick my language.

339
00:14:58.076 --> 00:14:59.586
Go pick my country.

340
00:15:00.046 --> 00:15:00.876
Connect to my network.

341
00:15:01.176 --> 00:15:03.566
So at this point, the
device is now talking

342
00:15:03.566 --> 00:15:04.576
to the Apple Services

343
00:15:04.886 --> 00:15:07.336
and obtaining its
activation information.

344
00:15:07.336 --> 00:15:10.866
And as part of that information
is the notice that we are now

345
00:15:10.866 --> 00:15:16.146
in the DEP and we got prompted
for enrolling in the MDM server.

346
00:15:16.566 --> 00:15:20.646
So just in a second we are still
returning some information.

347
00:15:21.206 --> 00:15:24.206
And now we are talking
to our server.

348
00:15:24.206 --> 00:15:27.196
So this is as far as DEP
has talked to the device.

349
00:15:27.446 --> 00:15:29.556
Now we're talking
to our MDM server.

350
00:15:29.866 --> 00:15:32.496
And I can find more
information about our instance.

351
00:15:32.766 --> 00:15:34.776
So if I need to know
what to do next,

352
00:15:34.776 --> 00:15:36.196
I can call the ACME Help Desk.

353
00:15:36.556 --> 00:15:38.656
And now I go to the next.

354
00:15:38.656 --> 00:15:42.646
And you see that when I go
forward, I'm now prompted

355
00:15:42.646 --> 00:15:44.556
for my user name and password.

356
00:15:44.906 --> 00:15:47.906
And I cannot bypass this;
so I do have to enroll this.

357
00:15:48.166 --> 00:15:51.646
So this device has been
configured to be supervised,

358
00:15:51.906 --> 00:15:53.956
and the MDM profile
is mandatory.

359
00:15:54.176 --> 00:15:56.236
So I have no way of
bypassing this step.

360
00:15:56.736 --> 00:15:59.856
So I'll provide my log in
information and move on.

361
00:15:59.856 --> 00:16:04.726
And now we're downloading the
profiles from our MDM server.

362
00:15:59.856 --> 00:16:04.726
And now we're downloading the
profiles from our MDM server.

363
00:16:04.926 --> 00:16:09.576
So, again the DEP phase has been
completed, and now we're talking

364
00:16:09.576 --> 00:16:11.206
to our management server.

365
00:16:11.676 --> 00:16:14.626
And Mark has set some
screens to be bypassed here,

366
00:16:14.846 --> 00:16:16.836
so we're not seeing
registration and other pieces.

367
00:16:17.116 --> 00:16:19.956
And while I complete my setup
logging into my iCloud account,

368
00:16:20.246 --> 00:16:22.486
I'll have Mark show you
the setup in the backside.

369
00:16:22.796 --> 00:16:25.576
>> Yep. So Jussi is going to
finish setting up his iPad.

370
00:16:25.576 --> 00:16:27.396
And I want to walk
you through how

371
00:16:27.396 --> 00:16:29.556
in Profile Manager we've
implemented this UI

372
00:16:29.556 --> 00:16:31.676
to support configuring
Device Enrollment Program.

373
00:16:32.236 --> 00:16:34.706
So on the left side
you see the devices

374
00:16:34.706 --> 00:16:35.646
that my server has retrieved

375
00:16:35.646 --> 00:16:37.516
from the Device Enrollment
Program.

376
00:16:37.516 --> 00:16:40.396
My server is configured
to download these devices,

377
00:16:40.396 --> 00:16:42.856
and then I have Jussi's
iPad selected here.

378
00:16:42.856 --> 00:16:44.536
And you can see the
enrollment settings

379
00:16:44.536 --> 00:16:45.846
that I've got selected here.

380
00:16:45.846 --> 00:16:49.566
Our first option is whether
to turn on this configuration

381
00:16:49.566 --> 00:16:50.436
for this device or not.

382
00:16:50.746 --> 00:16:52.356
You can also put
these configurations

383
00:16:52.396 --> 00:16:53.776
on device groups as well.

384
00:16:53.776 --> 00:16:54.756
So you can get a
whole collection

385
00:16:54.756 --> 00:16:56.896
of devices get the
same settings.

386
00:16:56.956 --> 00:16:58.556
So we have this checked
on because we wanted

387
00:16:58.556 --> 00:16:59.456
to send the settings down.

388
00:16:59.736 --> 00:17:00.826
The next option is whether

389
00:16:59.736 --> 00:17:00.826
The next option is whether

390
00:17:00.826 --> 00:17:03.066
or not the user is
allowed to skip enrollment.

391
00:17:03.486 --> 00:17:06.715
And, as you saw in the case of
Jussi's device, he's not allowed

392
00:17:06.715 --> 00:17:09.205
to skip enrollment; he's going
to be prompted for credentials,

393
00:17:09.205 --> 00:17:10.486
credentials for his
directory server.

394
00:17:11.276 --> 00:17:12.816
Our next option is whether
or not we want to do

395
00:17:12.816 --> 00:17:14.675
over the air supervision
of the device.

396
00:17:15.106 --> 00:17:17.856
Now, in addition to being
able to supervise the device,

397
00:17:17.906 --> 00:17:20.236
when you supervise the device,
you also have the option

398
00:17:20.636 --> 00:17:22.205
of locking the MDM Profile

399
00:17:22.205 --> 00:17:23.756
so it can't be removed
from the device.

400
00:17:23.856 --> 00:17:26.486
In our case, we've combined
those into one option

401
00:17:26.486 --> 00:17:28.566
because we think our customers,
whenever they supervise,

402
00:17:28.566 --> 00:17:30.446
they're going to want
to have locked MDM.

403
00:17:30.446 --> 00:17:33.696
But if you're a third party MDM
developer, you can always break

404
00:17:33.696 --> 00:17:36.446
that out and have it
as a separate option.

405
00:17:37.616 --> 00:17:41.276
The next thing is whether or
not you want to allow pairing.

406
00:17:41.756 --> 00:17:44.296
So I have that turned on
so the device can pair

407
00:17:44.296 --> 00:17:45.226
with another Mac if you want.

408
00:17:45.586 --> 00:17:48.016
Next is to request
credentials for enrollment.

409
00:17:48.016 --> 00:17:50.436
You saw Jussi's device was
prompted for credentials.

410
00:17:50.806 --> 00:17:51.786
And then there are
various things

411
00:17:51.786 --> 00:17:53.646
that we can skip
during the setup show

412
00:17:53.646 --> 00:17:55.486
or skip during the
Setup Assistant.

413
00:17:55.656 --> 00:17:58.276
In our case, we have Apple
ID enabled because we want

414
00:17:58.606 --> 00:18:00.426
to caption on, Jussi's
device will get Activation

415
00:17:58.606 --> 00:18:00.426
to caption on, Jussi's
device will get Activation

416
00:18:00.426 --> 00:18:01.036
Lock enabled.

417
00:18:01.376 --> 00:18:05.356
So Jussi is finished actually
setting up his device.

418
00:18:05.716 --> 00:18:10.666
So I am going to show
you, our security settings

419
00:18:10.766 --> 00:18:12.776
for the device right now show

420
00:18:12.776 --> 00:18:14.356
that Activation Lock
is not enabled.

421
00:18:14.356 --> 00:18:16.156
But I do have the
Activation Lock bypass code.

422
00:18:16.156 --> 00:18:18.086
This what Profile
Manager grabbed

423
00:18:18.086 --> 00:18:19.456
from the device when
it was enrolled.

424
00:18:19.746 --> 00:18:25.676
If I update my info
now that he's done,

425
00:18:26.566 --> 00:18:27.606
we'll see in a moment here

426
00:18:27.716 --> 00:18:29.486
that Activation Lock is
going to change to yes.

427
00:18:29.576 --> 00:18:32.056
And find my iPhone is
enabled, is set to yes.

428
00:18:32.346 --> 00:18:37.586
So when this device comes
back to me, I'll be able

429
00:18:37.586 --> 00:18:39.036
to run this clear
Activation Lock

430
00:18:39.036 --> 00:18:40.916
if Activation Lock
is still enabled.

431
00:18:41.156 --> 00:18:43.246
And I and clear that
and hand this device

432
00:18:43.246 --> 00:18:44.106
out to the next user.

433
00:18:44.376 --> 00:18:45.456
So back to Todd.

434
00:18:45.456 --> 00:18:46.746
>> All right.

435
00:18:46.746 --> 00:18:47.416
Thank you, guys.

436
00:18:48.516 --> 00:18:52.556
[ Applause ]

437
00:18:53.056 --> 00:18:55.816
So Jussi and Mark just
showed you how you can enroll

438
00:18:55.816 --> 00:18:58.186
and supervise an iOS device
using the Device Enrollment

439
00:18:58.186 --> 00:19:01.286
Program and how to configure
the enrollment settings

440
00:18:58.186 --> 00:19:01.286
Program and how to configure
the enrollment settings

441
00:19:01.286 --> 00:19:03.096
that were used using
Profile Manager.

442
00:19:03.096 --> 00:19:05.666
But, of course, that can be
done with any MDM solution

443
00:19:05.666 --> 00:19:07.176
that supports the Device
Enrollment Program.

444
00:19:07.176 --> 00:19:09.216
And we hope all of them do.

445
00:19:09.686 --> 00:19:11.986
Mark showed you how Profile
Manager had retrieved the

446
00:19:11.986 --> 00:19:13.446
Activation Lock bypass code

447
00:19:13.446 --> 00:19:15.366
as it completed enrollment
of that device.

448
00:19:16.596 --> 00:19:20.966
And then Profile Manager
actually automatically allows

449
00:19:20.966 --> 00:19:23.496
or there's a setting, enrollment
setting which I don't know

450
00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:25.856
that Mark showed that the
administrator can choose

451
00:19:25.856 --> 00:19:29.486
to always automatically allow
Activation Lock once it's

452
00:19:29.486 --> 00:19:31.866
retrieved, successfully
retrieved the bypass code.

453
00:19:32.476 --> 00:19:35.316
So let's move on to the next
section of our talk and talk

454
00:19:35.316 --> 00:19:37.226
about distributing
content to our devices.

455
00:19:38.406 --> 00:19:39.226
We're, of course, going to talk

456
00:19:39.226 --> 00:19:40.506
about the Volume
Purchase Program

457
00:19:40.506 --> 00:19:41.556
and managed distribution.

458
00:19:42.226 --> 00:19:45.366
We'll talk a little bit about
managed apps and then conclude

459
00:19:45.366 --> 00:19:48.526
with the significant
enhancements in iOS 8

460
00:19:48.526 --> 00:19:51.026
and OS X Yosemite to
fill in some gaps here.

461
00:19:52.536 --> 00:19:56.126
So, again, to recap, managed
distribution allows the

462
00:19:56.126 --> 00:19:59.166
administrator to buy
licenses instead of codes,

463
00:20:00.226 --> 00:20:03.206
which can be revoked and
reallocated to a different user

464
00:20:03.466 --> 00:20:06.406
for both apps and books.

465
00:20:07.466 --> 00:20:10.956
And we provided API so that
MDM solutions can integrate the

466
00:20:10.956 --> 00:20:12.986
service into their solutions.

467
00:20:13.766 --> 00:20:15.666
And it's currently
available in 10 countries.

468
00:20:18.006 --> 00:20:20.696
So, again a refresher of
exactly how this works:

469
00:20:20.696 --> 00:20:23.976
The administrator can
purchase apps and books

470
00:20:23.976 --> 00:20:26.376
in the VPP Portal, that
information is stored

471
00:20:26.376 --> 00:20:28.216
in the iBookstore
and the App Store.

472
00:20:29.226 --> 00:20:31.336
When they provide their
account information

473
00:20:31.336 --> 00:20:34.366
to their management solution,
it can download information

474
00:20:34.366 --> 00:20:36.476
about which apps and
books have been purchased

475
00:20:36.906 --> 00:20:38.216
and are available
for assignment.

476
00:20:39.296 --> 00:20:41.826
It can send assignments
up to the iTunes Store

477
00:20:41.826 --> 00:20:45.656
and credit a particular app
or book to a user account.

478
00:20:46.856 --> 00:20:48.806
When the user configures
their Apple ID

479
00:20:48.806 --> 00:20:52.666
on a particular Apple device,
they'll see those assignments

480
00:20:52.666 --> 00:20:55.766
in their purchase list and
can download the bits directly

481
00:20:55.766 --> 00:20:58.176
from the store just as if they
had purchased them themselves.

482
00:20:59.306 --> 00:21:02.196
And, also, the administrator
can send MDM commands

483
00:20:59.306 --> 00:21:02.196
And, also, the administrator
can send MDM commands

484
00:21:02.196 --> 00:21:04.746
from the server to the devices
to say download this app

485
00:21:05.816 --> 00:21:07.686
to make sure that it
is actually installed

486
00:21:07.686 --> 00:21:08.766
on that particular device.

487
00:21:11.226 --> 00:21:13.836
So, again, dive into a
number of topics related

488
00:21:13.836 --> 00:21:15.976
to the Volume Purchase Program
to give you some advice on how

489
00:21:15.976 --> 00:21:18.926
to best integrate this
program into your solutions.

490
00:21:19.646 --> 00:21:22.686
Starting off again with where
should the different pieces

491
00:21:22.686 --> 00:21:24.576
of truth reside?

492
00:21:25.266 --> 00:21:28.276
And the VPP service itself
should really be the truth

493
00:21:28.276 --> 00:21:30.356
for the status of
user enrollment,

494
00:21:30.396 --> 00:21:32.666
whether a user has
accepted an invitation

495
00:21:32.666 --> 00:21:35.666
and associate the their
Apple ID with the VPP user,

496
00:21:36.756 --> 00:21:38.246
which licenses have
been purchased,

497
00:21:38.246 --> 00:21:41.336
as I showed on the previous
slide, as well as tracking

498
00:21:41.336 --> 00:21:44.276
in irrevocable book
assignments that have been made.

499
00:21:44.946 --> 00:21:47.026
You're MDM server should
actually be the truth

500
00:21:47.026 --> 00:21:50.046
for everything else including
revocable app assignments.

501
00:21:50.186 --> 00:21:51.836
And you might be
wondering why shouldn't

502
00:21:51.836 --> 00:21:53.246
that be in the VPP service?

503
00:21:53.896 --> 00:21:56.506
Well if your MDM solution
supports group assignments,

504
00:21:56.696 --> 00:21:59.006
you'll need to keep that
information in your MDM server

505
00:21:59.006 --> 00:22:01.286
because there's no way to
store group information

506
00:21:59.006 --> 00:22:01.286
because there's no way to
store group information

507
00:22:01.286 --> 00:22:02.526
in the VPP service.

508
00:22:02.946 --> 00:22:04.936
So if you're going to be able to
reconstitute that, you're going

509
00:22:04.936 --> 00:22:06.766
to need to have all that
within your database.

510
00:22:07.286 --> 00:22:10.396
Let's talk a little bit
about account management.

511
00:22:10.396 --> 00:22:14.556
When a particular administrator
provides their credentials,

512
00:22:14.556 --> 00:22:18.126
their VPP account to your
solution, and you want

513
00:22:18.126 --> 00:22:19.346
to establish that
initial connection

514
00:22:19.346 --> 00:22:22.546
with the Volume Purchase
Program you're going to need

515
00:22:22.546 --> 00:22:24.306
to check the client
context attribute.

516
00:22:24.896 --> 00:22:26.796
And if it's empty that means

517
00:22:26.796 --> 00:22:29.106
that no other server
has claimed this account

518
00:22:29.106 --> 00:22:30.156
or is using this account.

519
00:22:30.486 --> 00:22:31.656
And you should go
ahead and claim it

520
00:22:31.656 --> 00:22:35.766
by providing the host name of
your server and a unique a GUID

521
00:22:35.766 --> 00:22:38.426
so that you'll be able to tell
whether your server is still the

522
00:22:38.426 --> 00:22:39.066
one managing.

523
00:22:40.296 --> 00:22:42.506
If the client context
has a value

524
00:22:42.506 --> 00:22:45.326
and it doesn't match the GUID
that you have for that server,

525
00:22:45.666 --> 00:22:47.876
some other server is
actually using that account.

526
00:22:47.876 --> 00:22:49.876
And you're going to want
to alert the administrator

527
00:22:49.876 --> 00:22:52.936
that some other server is
managing the licenses tied

528
00:22:52.936 --> 00:22:56.786
to this account and ask them
to confirm that they, in fact,

529
00:22:56.786 --> 00:22:58.506
want this server to
take over that account.

530
00:22:58.896 --> 00:23:01.356
That may, in fact, be the right
thing if they're transitioning

531
00:22:58.896 --> 00:23:01.356
That may, in fact, be the right
thing if they're transitioning

532
00:23:01.356 --> 00:23:02.796
from one server to the next.

533
00:23:03.286 --> 00:23:06.766
And then further, whenever you
re establish the connection

534
00:23:06.766 --> 00:23:09.816
to the service, you need to
check client context again

535
00:23:09.816 --> 00:23:12.826
to make sure that your server is
still the one that's connected

536
00:23:12.826 --> 00:23:13.526
to this account.

537
00:23:14.286 --> 00:23:16.416
If it doesn't match
any longer, you, again,

538
00:23:16.466 --> 00:23:18.706
need to stop making
requests to the service

539
00:23:18.926 --> 00:23:20.346
and alert the administrator

540
00:23:20.346 --> 00:23:23.436
that this other host name
has now claimed this account

541
00:23:23.436 --> 00:23:24.926
so they can take
appropriate action.

542
00:23:27.326 --> 00:23:29.146
If I've mentioned
invitations already,

543
00:23:29.526 --> 00:23:32.466
that's part of bootstrapping
this program is

544
00:23:32.466 --> 00:23:35.336
that the administrator
needs it to invite each user

545
00:23:35.336 --> 00:23:39.116
to link their Apple ID to
this particular VPP account

546
00:23:39.506 --> 00:23:41.206
so that licenses
can be assigned.

547
00:23:42.016 --> 00:23:45.386
We strongly recommend that you
do this invitation via MDM.

548
00:23:46.016 --> 00:23:46.986
You can easily send

549
00:23:46.986 --> 00:23:48.986
that invitation via an
MDM command directly

550
00:23:48.986 --> 00:23:50.006
to an enrolled device.

551
00:23:50.006 --> 00:23:52.526
It's much more secure
and reliable.

552
00:23:53.416 --> 00:23:56.886
Email is a fall back if you
have a user you need to invite

553
00:23:56.886 --> 00:23:58.636
that doesn't currently
have an enrolled device.

554
00:23:59.986 --> 00:24:02.636
But there's a concern that
you need to be aware of that

555
00:23:59.986 --> 00:24:02.636
But there's a concern that
you need to be aware of that

556
00:24:02.636 --> 00:24:05.616
because the invitation URL,
there's an example on screen,

557
00:24:06.026 --> 00:24:08.356
is for the apple.com domain.

558
00:24:08.996 --> 00:24:12.186
Many mail servers will
treat an email coming

559
00:24:12.186 --> 00:24:15.986
from your server's domain,
including a URL from apple.com

560
00:24:15.986 --> 00:24:18.136
as a phishing attack and
they filter them out.

561
00:24:18.936 --> 00:24:20.526
There are a number
of alternative ways

562
00:24:20.526 --> 00:24:21.506
to avoid this problem.

563
00:24:22.266 --> 00:24:26.056
You could create your invitation
email URL that brings the user,

564
00:24:26.056 --> 00:24:28.836
first, back to your MDM
server before redirected them

565
00:24:28.836 --> 00:24:29.936
to the VPP URL.

566
00:24:30.906 --> 00:24:33.456
Or you could integrate the
invitation process right

567
00:24:33.456 --> 00:24:35.016
into your user portal
if you have one.

568
00:24:35.566 --> 00:24:39.796
Let's spend a few
moments talking, again,

569
00:24:39.796 --> 00:24:42.996
about user IDs relating to
Volume Purchase Program.

570
00:24:42.996 --> 00:24:44.306
I showed this slide last year.

571
00:24:44.916 --> 00:24:49.616
There are really 3 ideas of who
the user is from the perspective

572
00:24:49.616 --> 00:24:54.046
of the MDM server, from the
perspective of the VPP service,

573
00:24:54.446 --> 00:24:56.296
and the end user's Apple ID,

574
00:24:56.426 --> 00:25:00.416
which your MDM server will never
see directly but will see a hash

575
00:24:56.426 --> 00:25:00.416
which your MDM server will never
see directly but will see a hash

576
00:25:00.416 --> 00:25:02.246
of it to protect
the user's privacy.

577
00:25:03.246 --> 00:25:05.046
Now, this is would be
very simple if we lived

578
00:25:05.046 --> 00:25:08.066
in the ideal world
where each user had one

579
00:25:08.066 --> 00:25:11.376
and only one Apple ID
associated with your VPP account

580
00:25:11.816 --> 00:25:13.276
and would never change
that Apple ID.

581
00:25:13.276 --> 00:25:16.576
In this case, there would be
a simple one to one mapping

582
00:25:16.616 --> 00:25:19.196
between all 3 of these
representations of the user.

583
00:25:20.056 --> 00:25:22.126
Sadly, as many of
you may be aware,

584
00:25:22.256 --> 00:25:23.496
we don't live in an ideal world.

585
00:25:24.306 --> 00:25:28.236
In the real world, multiple
VPP users can accept their

586
00:25:28.236 --> 00:25:30.266
individual invitations
with the same Apple ID.

587
00:25:30.266 --> 00:25:32.736
And you need to be aware
of the implications

588
00:25:32.736 --> 00:25:34.506
of the sharing of Apple IDs.

589
00:25:35.086 --> 00:25:38.786
Specifically if you've
assigned a license to a user

590
00:25:38.786 --> 00:25:41.276
that than is connected to
that particular Apple ID.

591
00:25:41.576 --> 00:25:43.606
If you revoke that assignment,
it's going to revoke it

592
00:25:43.606 --> 00:25:47.156
from every Apple every VPP
user sharing that Apple ID.

593
00:25:48.416 --> 00:25:51.696
Also, if you try to
assign an app or a book

594
00:25:51.696 --> 00:25:55.966
to a VPP user that's
associated with an Apple ID

595
00:25:55.966 --> 00:25:59.276
that already has that
app or book assigned,

596
00:25:59.636 --> 00:26:02.546
that second assignment
will fail.

597
00:25:59.636 --> 00:26:02.546
that second assignment
will fail.

598
00:26:02.546 --> 00:26:05.736
Another issue in the real
world is that users can,

599
00:26:06.056 --> 00:26:08.606
after accepting an
invitation with one Apple ID,

600
00:26:08.606 --> 00:26:12.016
can disassociate from that Apple
ID and associate and accept

601
00:26:12.016 --> 00:26:13.786
that invitation with
a different Apple ID.

602
00:26:13.886 --> 00:26:16.956
This becomes a problem if you've
assigned any irrevocable book

603
00:26:17.326 --> 00:26:20.436
licenses to that Apple,
that retired Apple ID.

604
00:26:20.436 --> 00:26:23.296
And you'll have to keep track
and think about whether you want

605
00:26:23.296 --> 00:26:25.436
to allocate another
irrevocable book license

606
00:26:25.436 --> 00:26:26.726
to the new Apple ID or not.

607
00:26:30.426 --> 00:26:33.236
So the MDM server's
representation of the user,

608
00:26:33.236 --> 00:26:34.686
the client user ID string,

609
00:26:35.396 --> 00:26:37.076
is something that's
under your control.

610
00:26:37.076 --> 00:26:38.986
And we strongly recommend
you pick a value

611
00:26:38.986 --> 00:26:40.926
that will never change,
for example,

612
00:26:40.926 --> 00:26:42.836
the user ID from your
directory services

613
00:26:42.836 --> 00:26:45.056
where you're getting your
user and group information.

614
00:26:45.636 --> 00:26:46.446
You shouldn't choose something

615
00:26:46.446 --> 00:26:48.256
like an email address
which can change.

616
00:26:48.746 --> 00:26:51.276
And it's very simple.

617
00:26:51.276 --> 00:26:53.246
I had to have a slide with
some SQL on, I'm sorry.

618
00:26:53.246 --> 00:26:56.566
It's very easy, then, to
look up which VPP account

619
00:26:56.566 --> 00:26:59.896
that that particular MDM
user is associated with.

620
00:27:00.606 --> 00:27:02.886
Whether it's just registered
and you've sent the invitation

621
00:27:02.886 --> 00:27:05.746
or actually associated, whether
the user has accepted it.

622
00:27:06.256 --> 00:27:10.576
And, finally, the representation

623
00:27:10.576 --> 00:27:14.126
of the user's Apple ID who's
accepted the invitation takes

624
00:27:14.126 --> 00:27:16.186
the form of an iTunes
store ID hash.

625
00:27:16.786 --> 00:27:18.216
And you should track
this as soon

626
00:27:18.216 --> 00:27:20.136
as a user has accepted
an invitation.

627
00:27:21.106 --> 00:27:25.416
New in iOS 8, there's now a
MDM query, not just in iOS 8,

628
00:27:25.416 --> 00:27:29.386
it's also in OS X Yosemite, a
query to get that hash value

629
00:27:29.386 --> 00:27:35.096
so that you can know whether
the Apple ID that's configured

630
00:27:35.096 --> 00:27:36.966
on a particular device changes.

631
00:27:36.966 --> 00:27:39.276
You won't know exactly what the
Apple ID is but you'll be able

632
00:27:39.276 --> 00:27:40.836
to tell if they've disassociated

633
00:27:40.836 --> 00:27:43.326
and re-associated
with a different ID.

634
00:27:44.346 --> 00:27:46.726
As I mentioned already on the
previous slide, you're going

635
00:27:46.726 --> 00:27:50.866
to want to track those retired
values if the user switches

636
00:27:50.866 --> 00:27:53.706
to a different Apple ID,
again, so you can keep track

637
00:27:53.706 --> 00:27:55.456
of any irrevocable
book assignments.

638
00:27:55.896 --> 00:28:01.196
There's another new change
that will allow you MDM vendors

639
00:27:55.896 --> 00:28:01.196
There's another new change
that will allow you MDM vendors

640
00:28:01.196 --> 00:28:03.766
to provide a better user
experience in your tools

641
00:28:03.876 --> 00:28:07.696
for users outside the U.S. that
we now report the country code

642
00:28:07.876 --> 00:28:10.726
that the account is tied to
when you get your information

643
00:28:10.726 --> 00:28:13.476
down from the service so that
you can fetch the proper app

644
00:28:13.476 --> 00:28:15.756
metadata, artwork, description,

645
00:28:15.756 --> 00:28:18.546
app name from the
correct iTunes Store.

646
00:28:21.806 --> 00:28:24.366
So managed apps is
not a new concept.

647
00:28:24.366 --> 00:28:26.276
We've had it for a
couple of iOS releases.

648
00:28:26.666 --> 00:28:30.626
It's a way for enterprises
to keep better control

649
00:28:30.626 --> 00:28:32.926
over the data and documents
tied to particular apps.

650
00:28:33.376 --> 00:28:36.026
It works with both App
Store and enterprise apps.

651
00:28:36.906 --> 00:28:39.916
The managed apps must
be installed via MDM

652
00:28:40.716 --> 00:28:42.296
with the install
application command

653
00:28:42.296 --> 00:28:45.686
and with the management
flag set on the app itself.

654
00:28:46.546 --> 00:28:49.286
One limitation is that if the
user has already installed an

655
00:28:49.286 --> 00:28:51.596
app, the MDM server
cannot convert it

656
00:28:51.596 --> 00:28:52.926
to manage retroactively.

657
00:28:53.506 --> 00:28:54.766
However, the server
can, of course,

658
00:28:54.766 --> 00:28:59.046
detect that an app is unmanaged
and then alert the administrator

659
00:28:59.046 --> 00:29:02.766
so they could take action
outside of MDM, if necessary,

660
00:28:59.046 --> 00:29:02.766
so they could take action
outside of MDM, if necessary,

661
00:29:03.176 --> 00:29:05.306
to have the user delete that app

662
00:29:05.306 --> 00:29:07.306
and the MDM server
push it out again.

663
00:29:08.636 --> 00:29:13.576
Managed apps work with Managed
Open In a new feature in iOS 7

664
00:29:13.956 --> 00:29:16.176
to help, again, prevent
data leakage

665
00:29:16.176 --> 00:29:19.026
from managed apps
to unmanaged apps.

666
00:29:19.806 --> 00:29:21.616
So that if you have
a particular app

667
00:29:21.706 --> 00:29:25.156
that has sensitive documents,
you can treat it as managed.

668
00:29:25.216 --> 00:29:28.216
Turn on Managed Open In, and
then users will not be able

669
00:29:28.216 --> 00:29:30.256
to open those documents
in other apps

670
00:29:30.256 --> 00:29:31.666
like well, I won't name any.

671
00:29:32.976 --> 00:29:35.166
So you might imagine, I
talked about filling gaps

672
00:29:35.166 --> 00:29:37.646
and eliminating inconsistencies.

673
00:29:37.646 --> 00:29:40.786
We have managed apps so what
are we introducing in iOS 8?

674
00:29:40.786 --> 00:29:42.646
Well, of course, managed books.

675
00:29:43.576 --> 00:29:46.326
And just like managed
apps, managed books works

676
00:29:46.326 --> 00:29:51.546
with both iBookstore books where
you can, just like managed apps,

677
00:29:52.146 --> 00:29:55.446
tell the device to download
a particular iBookstore book

678
00:29:55.446 --> 00:29:56.526
and treat it as managed.

679
00:29:57.316 --> 00:29:59.096
That that book must
be published,

680
00:29:59.266 --> 00:30:02.156
purchased via VPP even
if the user has it.

681
00:29:59.266 --> 00:30:02.156
purchased via VPP even
if the user has it.

682
00:30:03.396 --> 00:30:07.126
One difference between managed
books and managed apps is

683
00:30:07.126 --> 00:30:09.756
that you can retroactively
manage books

684
00:30:09.756 --> 00:30:11.096
in contrast to manage apps.

685
00:30:11.096 --> 00:30:12.436
Even if the user
has it installed.

686
00:30:13.076 --> 00:30:15.566
This is very useful
in schools to ensure

687
00:30:15.566 --> 00:30:17.256
that a particular
title is installed,

688
00:30:17.346 --> 00:30:19.226
make sure the students
have all their work

689
00:30:19.226 --> 00:30:20.146
and the dog didn't eat it.

690
00:30:21.816 --> 00:30:27.286
Turning to enterprise books, you
can, just like enterprise apps,

691
00:30:27.286 --> 00:30:31.266
can install the MDM
and remove PDFs, ePubs,

692
00:30:31.266 --> 00:30:32.496
and iBooks Author books.

693
00:30:33.836 --> 00:30:36.746
These documents or
these titles are stored

694
00:30:36.746 --> 00:30:38.736
in a different location
than iBookstore books

695
00:30:39.246 --> 00:30:40.706
with Class C data protection.

696
00:30:41.806 --> 00:30:43.176
There are also a
number of restrictions

697
00:30:43.176 --> 00:30:45.096
that we're introducing
in iOS 8 to, again,

698
00:30:45.096 --> 00:30:48.896
give institutions
more confidence

699
00:30:48.896 --> 00:30:51.306
that the sensitive
data will be protected

700
00:30:51.306 --> 00:30:53.526
and not escape their control.

701
00:30:54.136 --> 00:30:57.496
They can disable iCloud backups
of these enterprise books

702
00:30:58.136 --> 00:31:00.276
so that they just stay on the
device where they're installed

703
00:30:58.136 --> 00:31:00.276
so that they just stay on the
device where they're installed

704
00:31:00.866 --> 00:31:04.006
and also disable the
user's highlights and notes

705
00:31:04.006 --> 00:31:06.376
on that title from being
synced to other devices.

706
00:31:08.446 --> 00:31:09.966
For you MDM vendors out there,

707
00:31:09.966 --> 00:31:11.876
it's going to be pretty straight
forward to implement this.

708
00:31:12.066 --> 00:31:14.606
Just like there's an install
application MDM command,

709
00:31:14.766 --> 00:31:17.086
there's now an Install
Media MDM command

710
00:31:17.656 --> 00:31:20.766
where if it's a managed
iBookstore book,

711
00:31:20.766 --> 00:31:22.826
you'll just specify
the iTunes store ID.

712
00:31:23.856 --> 00:31:26.946
And if it's an enterprise
book, you'll specify a URL back

713
00:31:26.946 --> 00:31:28.596
to your server to
download the bits.

714
00:31:29.696 --> 00:31:32.316
You need to specify a persistent
ID that's under your control

715
00:31:32.316 --> 00:31:35.236
so that you can uniquely
identify each enterprise book

716
00:31:35.236 --> 00:31:37.236
that's being installed
and its kind

717
00:31:38.036 --> 00:31:40.106
and then the matching
remove media command.

718
00:31:42.606 --> 00:31:44.256
There are a few limitations.

719
00:31:45.026 --> 00:31:48.046
Just like managed apps, is
requires the app installation

720
00:31:48.046 --> 00:31:49.116
and the end enrollment, right,

721
00:31:49.116 --> 00:31:50.696
to be able to install
managed books.

722
00:31:51.996 --> 00:31:54.666
And managing iBookstore books
requires that you've, again,

723
00:31:54.666 --> 00:31:58.096
purchased it via VPP and
that the App Store is enabled

724
00:31:58.096 --> 00:32:00.376
on the device that you're
pushing an enterprise book to.

725
00:31:58.096 --> 00:32:00.376
on the device that you're
pushing an enterprise book to.

726
00:32:02.336 --> 00:32:04.836
Another distinction
between managed apps

727
00:32:04.836 --> 00:32:08.186
and managed books is that the
MDM query to obtain the list

728
00:32:08.186 --> 00:32:11.136
of installed books will
only show managed books

729
00:32:11.136 --> 00:32:13.406
and not every book that's
installed by the user

730
00:32:13.526 --> 00:32:14.766
to preserve user privacy.

731
00:32:15.786 --> 00:32:19.846
And finally, again, to allow
the institutions to keep control

732
00:32:19.846 --> 00:32:21.806
over these enterprise books
and their sensitive data,

733
00:32:22.216 --> 00:32:24.236
enterprise books cannot
be synced off a device

734
00:32:24.236 --> 00:32:25.026
using iTunes.

735
00:32:26.656 --> 00:32:29.066
So turning from what's
new in iOS 8 to what's new

736
00:32:29.066 --> 00:32:31.046
in OS X Yosemite, we're
going to fill another gap.

737
00:32:32.056 --> 00:32:34.826
And we are, have
added the ability

738
00:32:34.826 --> 00:32:40.116
to install non App Store
apps via MDM on OS X.

739
00:32:40.436 --> 00:32:40.896
Thank you.

740
00:32:41.516 --> 00:32:43.546
[ Applause ]

741
00:32:44.046 --> 00:32:47.226
You can thank you Jussi
when he gets back up here.

742
00:32:47.316 --> 00:32:51.756
So you can specify a signed flat
package containing an app via

743
00:32:51.756 --> 00:32:54.546
this MDM command, the install
application MDM command

744
00:32:54.546 --> 00:32:58.366
which is now supported on OS
X for non App Store books.

745
00:32:58.936 --> 00:33:02.006
And, in fact, your MDM
solution can do the same thing

746
00:32:58.936 --> 00:33:02.006
And, in fact, your MDM
solution can do the same thing

747
00:33:02.006 --> 00:33:03.036
that Profile Manager has done

748
00:33:03.036 --> 00:33:05.746
that you can support the
administrator's providing you

749
00:33:05.746 --> 00:33:08.666
with just a .app bundle
as long as you package it

750
00:33:08.666 --> 00:33:13.046
up as a signed flat package and
send that over the MDM command.

751
00:33:14.116 --> 00:33:16.676
So without any further ado,
instead of talking more

752
00:33:16.676 --> 00:33:19.026
about this, I'd like to ask
Jussi and Mark to come back up

753
00:33:19.026 --> 00:33:20.496
and show you installing

754
00:33:20.616 --> 00:33:23.046
and removing enterprise
apps and books.

755
00:33:24.506 --> 00:33:24.806
>> All right.

756
00:33:24.926 --> 00:33:25.656
Thank you, Todd.

757
00:33:26.416 --> 00:33:28.766
And I'm just going to go
into my iBooks library.

758
00:33:28.946 --> 00:33:30.886
So here we have some books
that we already downloaded.

759
00:33:30.886 --> 00:33:32.446
I've been a keen reader

760
00:33:32.446 --> 00:33:34.176
of the Human Interface
Guidelines, apparently.

761
00:33:34.276 --> 00:33:37.246
And we just downloaded the
Swift book so we're going

762
00:33:37.246 --> 00:33:38.036
to learn some new things.

763
00:33:38.316 --> 00:33:41.406
And Mark's now going to
push a PDF for the device.

764
00:33:41.816 --> 00:33:43.766
So this is going to
be an enterprise book.

765
00:33:43.766 --> 00:33:47.976
And this is will have
the same open rules

766
00:33:47.976 --> 00:33:51.496
as any other managed
assets on the device.

767
00:33:51.496 --> 00:33:53.696
So we'll have data protection
between applications.

768
00:33:54.156 --> 00:33:58.186
And we won't be able to
share the book anywhere else.

769
00:33:58.346 --> 00:34:01.596
So this our fancy new PDF
that just got installed.

770
00:33:58.346 --> 00:34:01.596
So this our fancy new PDF
that just got installed.

771
00:34:01.966 --> 00:34:04.986
And now, since this is a
managed book controlled

772
00:34:04.986 --> 00:34:08.516
by our MDM solution, Mark
can also remove the book.

773
00:34:08.835 --> 00:34:11.726
So Mark can now remove the book

774
00:34:11.726 --> 00:34:13.706
and it disappears
from our bookshelf.

775
00:34:13.996 --> 00:34:16.266
So that's managing
books on iOS 8.

776
00:34:16.266 --> 00:34:17.146
And we're.

777
00:34:18.516 --> 00:34:20.576
[ Applause ]

778
00:34:21.076 --> 00:34:21.466
Thank you.

779
00:34:22.676 --> 00:34:25.886
And on iOS we've had the Apple
Teaching Store enterprise

780
00:34:25.886 --> 00:34:28.746
application so that we have
our fancy new Swift application

781
00:34:28.746 --> 00:34:29.806
here, ACME Hub.

782
00:34:30.226 --> 00:34:32.246
But as Todd mentioned,
we also have support

783
00:34:32.246 --> 00:34:34.286
for installing applications
on OS X.

784
00:34:34.676 --> 00:34:38.116
So here we go into our
Launchpad and Mark is now going

785
00:34:38.116 --> 00:34:39.866
to install our fancy ACME app

786
00:34:40.366 --> 00:34:43.356
onto the OS X client
and no hands.

787
00:34:43.446 --> 00:34:46.045
This is all installed
by the system.

788
00:34:46.426 --> 00:34:49.626
So sparkles fly and the ACME
app landed on the system.

789
00:34:49.626 --> 00:34:53.936
So over here's OS X using
the DEP app installation.

790
00:34:54.826 --> 00:34:55.946
So thank you, Mark.

791
00:34:55.946 --> 00:34:57.466
And now back to Todd.

792
00:34:58.156 --> 00:34:58.686
>> All right.

793
00:34:58.686 --> 00:34:59.716
Thank you very much, guys.

794
00:34:59.716 --> 00:35:01.426
That app was written
using Swift, right?

795
00:34:59.716 --> 00:35:01.426
That app was written
using Swift, right?

796
00:35:01.686 --> 00:35:02.326
>> Of course.

797
00:35:03.156 --> 00:35:03.976
>> They stayed up all night.

798
00:35:05.076 --> 00:35:05.466
All right.

799
00:35:05.746 --> 00:35:10.946
So Mark and Jussi just showed
installing a PDF on iOS 8 device

800
00:35:10.946 --> 00:35:14.646
and removing it as well as
installing an enterprise app

801
00:35:14.646 --> 00:35:16.376
on a Mac running OS X Yosemite.

802
00:35:17.156 --> 00:35:20.196
So let's proceed on to
our final section and talk

803
00:35:20.196 --> 00:35:22.146
about ongoing management
of devices.

804
00:35:23.506 --> 00:35:26.076
We're going to complete
the Activation Lock story

805
00:35:26.076 --> 00:35:27.956
to show you, to talk
about how you use

806
00:35:27.956 --> 00:35:30.386
that bypass code you
obtained at enrollment time.

807
00:35:31.296 --> 00:35:33.636
Talk a little bit about
integrating you're MDM solutions

808
00:35:33.636 --> 00:35:35.076
with external data sources.

809
00:35:36.236 --> 00:35:39.486
Talk about something new
called MDM service config.

810
00:35:39.486 --> 00:35:41.016
We'll come on to that
in a few minutes.

811
00:35:41.016 --> 00:35:43.286
And, then again, conclude
with what's coming

812
00:35:43.286 --> 00:35:45.226
in this year's OS releases.

813
00:35:46.906 --> 00:35:50.216
So one thing to keep in mind
with Activation Lock is,

814
00:35:50.426 --> 00:35:53.216
it's a little bit different
from some other services.

815
00:35:54.046 --> 00:35:55.916
When you get the device
information query,

816
00:35:55.916 --> 00:35:57.576
and Mark showed this
in Profile Manager

817
00:35:57.576 --> 00:35:59.876
when he re fetched
the device information

818
00:35:59.876 --> 00:36:02.666
and it reflected the change
and Activation Lock status.

819
00:35:59.876 --> 00:36:02.666
and it reflected the change
and Activation Lock status.

820
00:36:02.756 --> 00:36:05.116
There's a key that tells you
whether the device thinks it's

821
00:36:05.116 --> 00:36:05.886
Activation Locked.

822
00:36:06.826 --> 00:36:10.606
And there's a request that
you send not to the device,

823
00:36:10.606 --> 00:36:13.756
but to our activation server
to clear the Activation Lock

824
00:36:14.236 --> 00:36:16.336
and specify the bypass
code that you have.

825
00:36:17.436 --> 00:36:19.696
Now, because that request
doesn't go to the device,

826
00:36:20.736 --> 00:36:23.006
the device isn't checking
with the activation server,

827
00:36:23.006 --> 00:36:24.926
it's not going to know
that it's been cleared.

828
00:36:24.926 --> 00:36:26.536
So it's going to
continue to report

829
00:36:26.536 --> 00:36:28.876
that it's Activation
Locked to your MDM server.

830
00:36:30.826 --> 00:36:33.186
Also, even after
you have cleared

831
00:36:33.186 --> 00:36:36.146
on the activation server,
the user, if they log out of

832
00:36:36.146 --> 00:36:38.426
or remove their Apple
ID and log in again,

833
00:36:38.426 --> 00:36:40.026
that will re enable
Activation Lock.

834
00:36:40.476 --> 00:36:41.736
So you want to definitely
keep hold

835
00:36:41.736 --> 00:36:43.496
of that bypass code even
if you've cleared it.

836
00:36:43.796 --> 00:36:45.706
This isn't going to,
in the real world,

837
00:36:45.706 --> 00:36:48.046
going to usually be an issue
because typically you're going

838
00:36:48.046 --> 00:36:49.806
to use this when you have
the device in your hands.

839
00:36:50.376 --> 00:36:52.406
But you definitely want
to keep that bypass codes

840
00:36:52.406 --> 00:36:53.836
because you might
need to use it again.

841
00:36:57.516 --> 00:36:57.886
All right.

842
00:36:58.206 --> 00:37:01.296
So one of the most important
external data sources

843
00:36:58.206 --> 00:37:01.296
So one of the most important
external data sources

844
00:37:01.296 --> 00:37:02.596
that your MDM server
needs to integrate

845
00:37:02.596 --> 00:37:04.396
with is directory services.

846
00:37:04.396 --> 00:37:05.746
There are a number
of different ones

847
00:37:05.746 --> 00:37:07.986
that your server
probably supports.

848
00:37:09.136 --> 00:37:11.506
However, compared to
the database that's back

849
00:37:11.506 --> 00:37:12.616
in your MDM solution,

850
00:37:13.176 --> 00:37:15.746
most directory services
have some capabilities

851
00:37:15.746 --> 00:37:17.996
which make them limited
in this context.

852
00:37:19.146 --> 00:37:21.756
Usually you can't get a full
enumeration of their contents.

853
00:37:22.336 --> 00:37:24.526
And there's not an easy
way to discover the changes

854
00:37:24.526 --> 00:37:26.436
from the last time you
fetched some subsection

855
00:37:26.436 --> 00:37:27.306
of those contents.

856
00:37:27.836 --> 00:37:30.556
They can be intermittently
available and slow.

857
00:37:31.156 --> 00:37:32.696
So you're going to want
to need to mirror some

858
00:37:32.696 --> 00:37:34.606
of the information
into your server.

859
00:37:34.996 --> 00:37:38.236
In contrast, we've designed both
the Device Enrollment Program

860
00:37:38.236 --> 00:37:41.106
service and the Volume Purchase
Program service to be simple

861
00:37:41.106 --> 00:37:43.996
and efficient to mirror that
data into your MDM solution.

862
00:37:44.446 --> 00:37:46.946
You can fully enumerate
the licenses for VPP

863
00:37:47.146 --> 00:37:49.316
or the device list for the
Device Enrollment Program.

864
00:37:49.786 --> 00:37:51.806
And it's easy to get the
changes from the last time

865
00:37:51.806 --> 00:37:53.056
that you got the enumeration.

866
00:37:53.846 --> 00:37:55.436
So you should definitely
mirror this information

867
00:37:55.436 --> 00:37:58.886
down in your database and
not use those services

868
00:37:58.886 --> 00:38:01.816
for live access.

869
00:37:58.886 --> 00:38:01.816
for live access.

870
00:38:01.996 --> 00:38:04.616
Similarly, you're
going to want to mirror

871
00:38:04.616 --> 00:38:06.386
in the directory
services information

872
00:38:06.386 --> 00:38:08.296
to get better performance
and reliability

873
00:38:08.296 --> 00:38:11.006
and all the benefits
of your database.

874
00:38:11.526 --> 00:38:13.096
But definitely leave
the authentication piece

875
00:38:13.096 --> 00:38:14.226
in directory services.

876
00:38:14.226 --> 00:38:16.086
It's less frequently
used, and you need

877
00:38:16.086 --> 00:38:18.876
to have a single source
of truth for that.

878
00:38:19.116 --> 00:38:20.196
Also, you're not going to want

879
00:38:20.196 --> 00:38:21.946
to mirror your entire
directory services

880
00:38:21.976 --> 00:38:23.306
into your database, of course.

881
00:38:23.306 --> 00:38:26.256
You want to just mirror in
records that are related to MDM.

882
00:38:26.256 --> 00:38:32.316
Next, I want to talk about
a new concept that those

883
00:38:32.316 --> 00:38:34.426
of you familiar with the
StoreBag from iTunes,

884
00:38:34.426 --> 00:38:36.466
we could also call
this the URL bag.

885
00:38:37.676 --> 00:38:40.116
It's something that would
make it much easier for tools

886
00:38:40.116 --> 00:38:42.586
like Apple Configurator and
other device management tools

887
00:38:42.626 --> 00:38:46.686
to just ask the MDM server what
information they can obtain

888
00:38:46.826 --> 00:38:47.746
from it.

889
00:38:49.266 --> 00:38:51.866
We specify this new
URI MDM service config

890
00:38:52.316 --> 00:38:57.096
that any tool could then make
an unauthenticated HTTPS request

891
00:38:57.096 --> 00:39:01.616
to your server and ask for it to
provide a UTF8 JSON encoded hash

892
00:38:57.096 --> 00:39:01.616
to your server and ask for it to
provide a UTF8 JSON encoded hash

893
00:39:01.616 --> 00:39:05.806
for example, the URL for your
MDM server's Device Enrollment

894
00:39:05.806 --> 00:39:06.566
Program enrollment.

895
00:39:07.356 --> 00:39:09.686
This would allow a tool
like Apple Configurator

896
00:39:09.686 --> 00:39:12.576
to make it much easier for
administrator to use it

897
00:39:12.576 --> 00:39:14.806
to configure settings
because they wouldn't have

898
00:39:14.806 --> 00:39:16.596
to type the entire
enrollment URL.

899
00:39:16.676 --> 00:39:19.186
They'd only have to type
the domain of your server.

900
00:39:19.636 --> 00:39:22.176
And it could then ask the
server what's your URL

901
00:39:22.176 --> 00:39:23.476
and complete that for the user.

902
00:39:24.136 --> 00:39:26.396
So we're going to
be implementing this

903
00:39:26.396 --> 00:39:28.826
in Profile Manager and we strong
we would really like to see

904
00:39:28.826 --> 00:39:30.406
that in your MDM
solutions as well.

905
00:39:31.856 --> 00:39:35.556
So, again, let's turn to what's
coming new in iOS 8 in terms

906
00:39:35.556 --> 00:39:37.316
of MDM commands and queries.

907
00:39:37.316 --> 00:39:38.756
We've seen some of
these already.

908
00:39:38.756 --> 00:39:42.136
But it's now possible for
supervised devices to tell them

909
00:39:42.136 --> 00:39:44.076
to set their device
name via MDM.

910
00:39:44.846 --> 00:39:47.426
You can also clear the
restrictions passcode

911
00:39:47.426 --> 00:39:49.596
in the user has themselves
configured

912
00:39:49.596 --> 00:39:53.126
in the settings UI
restrictions and set a passcode.

913
00:39:53.126 --> 00:39:56.616
That would have prevented,
in the past the administrator

914
00:39:56.616 --> 00:39:58.216
from overriding those
restrictions.

915
00:39:58.636 --> 00:40:02.046
Now, you can send an MDM command
that removes those settings

916
00:39:58.636 --> 00:40:02.046
Now, you can send an MDM command
that removes those settings

917
00:40:02.046 --> 00:40:05.426
and allows the MDM server to
configure its own settings.

918
00:40:06.116 --> 00:40:07.556
We've already seen
the new install

919
00:40:07.556 --> 00:40:11.306
and remove media commands
as well as the query

920
00:40:11.306 --> 00:40:14.326
that allows you to ask which
iTunes account is configured

921
00:40:14.326 --> 00:40:16.956
on the device via the
iTunes Store ID hash.

922
00:40:17.486 --> 00:40:20.046
But it's also now possible
to query the device to ask,

923
00:40:20.046 --> 00:40:21.946
when did it last
back up to iCloud?

924
00:40:24.386 --> 00:40:26.646
There are a number of new
payloads and additions

925
00:40:26.646 --> 00:40:28.346
to existing payloads in iOS 8.

926
00:40:29.186 --> 00:40:31.106
There's a new VPN
connection type.

927
00:40:32.376 --> 00:40:36.526
We've added new plug in content
filters to expand on the built

928
00:40:36.526 --> 00:40:38.766
in content filters that
we shipped in iOS 7.

929
00:40:40.136 --> 00:40:42.036
There's a new payload,
called Managed Domains,

930
00:40:42.036 --> 00:40:43.686
which we're going to show
you a little bit later

931
00:40:43.686 --> 00:40:46.976
that you can have managed
email and web domains that work

932
00:40:46.976 --> 00:40:50.236
in conjunction with managed apps
and books and managed open end

933
00:40:50.236 --> 00:40:53.846
and help institutions
keep their data secure.

934
00:40:55.896 --> 00:40:57.366
I think they actually mentioned,

935
00:40:57.416 --> 00:41:00.146
Craig actually mentioned
the message S/MIME switch

936
00:40:57.416 --> 00:41:00.146
Craig actually mentioned
the message S/MIME switch

937
00:41:00.146 --> 00:41:01.256
in mail yesterday.

938
00:41:01.256 --> 00:41:03.316
And it's possible to configure
whether that's available

939
00:41:03.316 --> 00:41:05.566
to you user for both
email and exchange.

940
00:41:06.656 --> 00:41:09.616
You can specify a certificate
in the single sign-on payload

941
00:41:09.616 --> 00:41:13.056
that allows automatic refreshing
of the Kerberos credentials

942
00:41:13.056 --> 00:41:15.076
without the user having
to take any action.

943
00:41:15.286 --> 00:41:17.556
And there are a number
of new restrictions,

944
00:41:18.486 --> 00:41:20.536
both for unsupervised devices,

945
00:41:20.586 --> 00:41:24.596
the 5 at the top including
disabling the it's a really cool

946
00:41:24.596 --> 00:41:29.356
feature Handoff, but that also
may worry certain institutions

947
00:41:29.356 --> 00:41:32.646
about data that they consider
sensitive transitioning

948
00:41:32.646 --> 00:41:36.126
from a managed device to another
device outside of their control.

949
00:41:37.076 --> 00:41:39.346
We also already saw
the restrictions

950
00:41:39.346 --> 00:41:40.626
on enterprise books.

951
00:41:41.406 --> 00:41:44.816
And there are 2 new
supervised restrictions

952
00:41:45.516 --> 00:41:47.866
that you can prevent the
user from erasing all content

953
00:41:47.866 --> 00:41:49.866
and settings and wiping
the device and undoing all

954
00:41:49.866 --> 00:41:51.826
that hard work you did
to configure that device.

955
00:41:52.606 --> 00:41:55.696
As well as a pair
for the MDM command

956
00:41:55.696 --> 00:41:57.586
that once you've
cleared the restrictions,

957
00:41:57.586 --> 00:41:58.966
you can disable the user

958
00:41:58.966 --> 00:42:05.336
from actually configuring them
using the device UI in settings.

959
00:41:58.966 --> 00:42:05.336
from actually configuring them
using the device UI in settings.

960
00:42:06.246 --> 00:42:08.046
Speaking of the device
UI in settings,

961
00:42:08.046 --> 00:42:10.036
the iOS team has
done a lot of work

962
00:42:10.036 --> 00:42:12.496
to dramatically improve
the end user experience

963
00:42:12.836 --> 00:42:15.696
to see the effects
of an MDM enrollment

964
00:42:15.696 --> 00:42:17.816
and any configuration profiles.

965
00:42:18.576 --> 00:42:22.586
An MDM relationship is now
represented with a single item

966
00:42:23.046 --> 00:42:25.986
that coalesces all the
profiles that are installed via

967
00:42:25.986 --> 00:42:29.576
that MDM channel showing
all the settings, apps,

968
00:42:29.576 --> 00:42:32.036
and books that have come down
via that MDM relationship

969
00:42:32.416 --> 00:42:34.766
with the most important
things likes accounts and apps

970
00:42:34.766 --> 00:42:36.426
and books and restrictions
at the top.

971
00:42:37.286 --> 00:42:38.256
What this also means is

972
00:42:38.256 --> 00:42:40.056
that users cannot no
longer cherry pick

973
00:42:40.056 --> 00:42:41.696
and remove individual profiles

974
00:42:41.696 --> 00:42:43.896
that the MDM server has
delivered to the device

975
00:42:43.956 --> 00:42:45.386
because they're just
not shown that way.

976
00:42:47.996 --> 00:42:49.736
Another improvement
in the settings UI is

977
00:42:49.766 --> 00:42:52.216
that if there are particular
features like the camera

978
00:42:52.216 --> 00:42:55.886
or in the restrictions UI in
settings, it will indicate

979
00:42:55.886 --> 00:42:59.286
to the user that this particular
feature has been disabled due

980
00:42:59.286 --> 00:43:00.606
to a profile being installed.

981
00:42:59.286 --> 00:43:00.606
to a profile being installed.

982
00:43:01.536 --> 00:43:04.876
So that they aren't confused
and need to come to Genius Bar

983
00:43:04.876 --> 00:43:06.286
to ask them why their
camera's disabled.

984
00:43:08.426 --> 00:43:10.476
It's also much easier to see
all the certificate details

985
00:43:10.476 --> 00:43:12.106
that have been delivered
via MDM.

986
00:43:13.016 --> 00:43:16.396
And finally provision profiles
no longer appear at all

987
00:43:16.396 --> 00:43:19.036
in settings because it's handled
completely automatically.

988
00:43:19.426 --> 00:43:23.286
The device will automatically
prune expired provision profiles

989
00:43:23.286 --> 00:43:23.976
when they're no longer needed.

990
00:43:24.516 --> 00:43:27.926
[ Applause ]

991
00:43:28.426 --> 00:43:29.696
One less thing to worry about.

992
00:43:30.706 --> 00:43:35.006
Turning to OS X Yosemite,
you'll see that we have support

993
00:43:35.006 --> 00:43:36.316
for a number of the
new payloads.

994
00:43:36.316 --> 00:43:39.636
I already talked about on
iOS 8 as well as the query

995
00:43:39.636 --> 00:43:42.956
to determine which iTunes
account has been configured

996
00:43:42.956 --> 00:43:43.916
on that particular Mac.

997
00:43:44.756 --> 00:43:48.596
And we also have plugged another
gap in adding the command

998
00:43:48.596 --> 00:43:51.446
that tells a Mac to
initiate AirPlay Mirroring

999
00:43:51.446 --> 00:43:52.406
to a destination.

1000
00:43:54.376 --> 00:43:56.356
So without further ado,
I'm going to ask the guys

1001
00:43:56.356 --> 00:43:59.156
to come back up and show you a
few things that I just talked

1002
00:43:59.156 --> 00:44:02.336
about and completing
the device duty cycle.

1003
00:43:59.156 --> 00:44:02.336
about and completing
the device duty cycle.

1004
00:44:03.086 --> 00:44:07.396
>> So we go to the settings and
we'll see what we have active

1005
00:44:07.396 --> 00:44:10.226
as manage settings
from our MDM server.

1006
00:44:10.226 --> 00:44:14.376
So you'll notice that you
don't have a profile setting

1007
00:44:14.376 --> 00:44:15.266
under general anymore.

1008
00:44:15.516 --> 00:44:16.756
This is called Device
Management.

1009
00:44:17.026 --> 00:44:20.296
If I just had regular
configuration profiles

1010
00:44:20.296 --> 00:44:22.886
installed, this tab
would be called Profiles.

1011
00:44:23.126 --> 00:44:25.086
If I have both Device
Management setting

1012
00:44:25.356 --> 00:44:28.006
and Profiles installed it will
be called Device Management

1013
00:44:28.006 --> 00:44:28.536
and Profiles.

1014
00:44:29.016 --> 00:44:31.526
So but since we only have the
MDM enrollment profile here,

1015
00:44:31.976 --> 00:44:33.446
I'm going to look into that.

1016
00:44:33.446 --> 00:44:38.706
And, as you notice, this now
a non-removable MDM profile.

1017
00:44:39.276 --> 00:44:41.646
And you'll notice that
every single profile

1018
00:44:41.646 --> 00:44:44.286
that the server has
pushed is now collated

1019
00:44:44.316 --> 00:44:46.966
into some sensical category.

1020
00:44:46.966 --> 00:44:48.876
So we have restrictions
so you can tell

1021
00:44:49.206 --> 00:44:51.586
which restrictions have been
configured by the server.

1022
00:44:52.926 --> 00:44:56.196
And we have applications that
have been installed here.

1023
00:44:56.566 --> 00:44:58.786
And we have also accounts
that have been configured.

1024
00:44:59.116 --> 00:45:01.396
So we don't show the
individual profiles

1025
00:44:59.116 --> 00:45:01.396
So we don't show the
individual profiles

1026
00:45:01.556 --> 00:45:02.846
that actually configured this.

1027
00:45:03.166 --> 00:45:04.666
We just collate all
this information

1028
00:45:04.666 --> 00:45:07.406
so that's it's more readily
accessible and discoverable.

1029
00:45:08.146 --> 00:45:10.366
And in more details,
as Todd mentioned,

1030
00:45:10.366 --> 00:45:12.946
we have better information
about certificates.

1031
00:45:12.946 --> 00:45:16.556
We can now actually see the full
signatures and how they keyed it

1032
00:45:16.556 --> 00:45:18.296
up so it's not just
like dot, dot, dot.

1033
00:45:19.166 --> 00:45:21.836
And you can also
have information

1034
00:45:21.836 --> 00:45:23.766
about other settings
that come down.

1035
00:45:23.956 --> 00:45:25.746
And here we have
managed domains.

1036
00:45:25.746 --> 00:45:27.896
So I'm going to show
you managed domains.

1037
00:45:27.896 --> 00:45:29.836
How those are working in mail.

1038
00:45:30.196 --> 00:45:33.416
So we are in ACME, Inc.

1039
00:45:33.556 --> 00:45:34.886
in acmeinc.private.

1040
00:45:34.886 --> 00:45:37.766
And as I'm going to
start composing an email,

1041
00:45:38.156 --> 00:45:40.726
I'm going to pick
mark@mdm.apple.com.

1042
00:45:41.106 --> 00:45:43.116
And this is now Mark's address.

1043
00:45:43.716 --> 00:45:46.346
This is not something that I
should probably be sending email

1044
00:45:46.516 --> 00:45:48.266
to so it's marked as red.

1045
00:45:48.736 --> 00:45:51.476
If I use a different address,

1046
00:45:51.626 --> 00:45:55.656
use my acme in private mail
that's marked as a valid email

1047
00:45:55.906 --> 00:45:58.676
that meets our email rules.

1048
00:45:58.946 --> 00:46:00.736
And this also applies
to my sending account

1049
00:45:58.946 --> 00:46:00.736
And this also applies
to my sending account

1050
00:46:00.736 --> 00:46:03.426
so since I have configured
this device for iCloud,

1051
00:46:03.426 --> 00:46:05.016
I also have my iCloud account.

1052
00:46:05.416 --> 00:46:08.566
So my iCloud account
is also marked

1053
00:46:08.826 --> 00:46:12.476
as not something I should
be sending mail with.

1054
00:46:12.716 --> 00:46:15.276
So that's managed
domains inside mail.

1055
00:46:17.526 --> 00:46:20.446
And then we are basically
done with the device.

1056
00:46:20.656 --> 00:46:22.686
So now we can return
this device to service

1057
00:46:22.986 --> 00:46:25.166
so the next user is going
to grab this machine.

1058
00:46:25.496 --> 00:46:26.656
And what Mark's going to do,

1059
00:46:26.656 --> 00:46:30.236
he's going to issue an erase
command onto the device.

1060
00:46:30.606 --> 00:46:34.196
So basically the user has left
the company or has graduated

1061
00:46:34.196 --> 00:46:36.966
from the school and
magic happens now.

1062
00:46:37.096 --> 00:46:39.086
So we're going to unplug
this device and plug

1063
00:46:39.136 --> 00:46:39.976
to a different device.

1064
00:46:41.216 --> 00:46:42.166
So here we go.

1065
00:46:42.716 --> 00:46:47.376
And now we have just
received the same device

1066
00:46:47.646 --> 00:46:49.846
and we're back in
the home screen.

1067
00:46:50.106 --> 00:46:52.866
I'm going to as a new
user, I'm going to walk

1068
00:46:52.866 --> 00:46:55.726
through the setup screens
and configure this device.

1069
00:46:55.726 --> 00:46:55.826
So.

1070
00:46:55.996 --> 00:46:59.256
>> This a device that's come
back for the duty cycle.

1071
00:46:59.496 --> 00:47:02.656
And I've got the Activation Lock
bypass code for this device.

1072
00:46:59.496 --> 00:47:02.656
And I've got the Activation Lock
bypass code for this device.

1073
00:47:03.116 --> 00:47:04.896
And so he's just
going to walk through,

1074
00:47:04.896 --> 00:47:07.536
go ahead, and set it up.

1075
00:47:07.806 --> 00:47:11.116
And when he encounters the fact
that it's locked, I'll be able

1076
00:47:11.116 --> 00:47:12.596
to clear it; and he'll be able

1077
00:47:12.596 --> 00:47:15.656
to actually finish
activation and continue on.

1078
00:47:16.336 --> 00:47:18.216
>> Right. So as soon
as the device talks

1079
00:47:18.216 --> 00:47:20.986
to the Apple services
again, I'm getting prompted

1080
00:47:20.986 --> 00:47:24.666
for some random Apple ID because
the previous user had enabled

1081
00:47:24.666 --> 00:47:27.116
iCloud even though this
was a supervised device,

1082
00:47:27.116 --> 00:47:29.956
we had allowed people
to use find my iPad

1083
00:47:30.356 --> 00:47:33.236
and now I have no idea what
this user's account is,

1084
00:47:33.486 --> 00:47:37.946
so Mark has just issued an
Activation Lock unlock command

1085
00:47:38.046 --> 00:47:41.466
from Profile Manager
and if I now go back

1086
00:47:41.466 --> 00:47:46.976
to the activation phase, now
I'm going to prompted to enroll

1087
00:47:46.976 --> 00:47:50.586
in my MDM server, again all
ACME help desk for an issue.

1088
00:47:51.086 --> 00:47:53.836
And my next user is now
going to get prompted

1089
00:47:53.836 --> 00:47:56.866
to enter their password,
and we're good to go.

1090
00:47:57.126 --> 00:48:00.456
So that's the duty cycle
of using iPads with MDM

1091
00:47:57.126 --> 00:48:00.456
So that's the duty cycle
of using iPads with MDM

1092
00:48:00.456 --> 00:48:02.306
and Device Enrollment Program.

1093
00:48:02.306 --> 00:48:04.546
So thank you, Mark,
and back to Todd.

1094
00:48:04.836 --> 00:48:07.886
>> So Jussi just gave you a
brief tour of the new easier

1095
00:48:07.886 --> 00:48:11.736
to understand user interface
in settings in iOS 8.

1096
00:48:11.736 --> 00:48:15.376
Make it easier for a user to
understand what the impacts

1097
00:48:15.376 --> 00:48:17.436
of that MDM relationship
is on their device.

1098
00:48:18.496 --> 00:48:20.926
Showed you how managed
email domains work

1099
00:48:21.206 --> 00:48:25.866
to help users prevent data
leakage sending documents

1100
00:48:25.866 --> 00:48:26.996
to the wrong email addresses.

1101
00:48:27.836 --> 00:48:30.976
We also showed how to use the
Activation Lock bypass code

1102
00:48:30.976 --> 00:48:33.906
that we captured when enrolling
device to enable the device

1103
00:48:33.906 --> 00:48:35.606
to be wiped and returned
to service

1104
00:48:35.886 --> 00:48:37.166
by completing the duty cycle.

1105
00:48:37.766 --> 00:48:39.266
And, again, getting that device

1106
00:48:39.266 --> 00:48:41.056
through Device Enrollment
Program settings

1107
00:48:41.166 --> 00:48:42.856
to reenroll in your
MDM solution.

1108
00:48:44.356 --> 00:48:46.086
That brings us to the
end of our session.

1109
00:48:46.626 --> 00:48:48.166
I'd like to sum up for, again,

1110
00:48:48.166 --> 00:48:49.776
the different audiences
for this session.

1111
00:48:49.996 --> 00:48:51.116
If you're an administrator,

1112
00:48:51.466 --> 00:48:53.526
you should use the Device
Enrollment Program if you want

1113
00:48:53.526 --> 00:48:56.316
to enroll your devices
wirelessly or Apple Configurator

1114
00:48:56.316 --> 00:48:57.356
if you want to do it wired.

1115
00:48:58.456 --> 00:49:00.926
You should use the Volume
Purchase Program managed

1116
00:48:58.456 --> 00:49:00.926
You should use the Volume
Purchase Program managed

1117
00:49:00.926 --> 00:49:02.916
distribution and
managed apps and books

1118
00:49:02.916 --> 00:49:04.836
to distribute content
to your devices.

1119
00:49:05.486 --> 00:49:07.106
If you are a MDM
solution provider,

1120
00:49:07.416 --> 00:49:09.366
please support all
these services:

1121
00:49:09.366 --> 00:49:11.906
Device Enrollment Program,
Volume Purchase Program,

1122
00:49:11.946 --> 00:49:14.306
and Activation Lock
management as well

1123
00:49:14.306 --> 00:49:16.136
as all the new futures
we talked about today

1124
00:49:16.266 --> 00:49:18.366
in both iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite.

1125
00:49:19.166 --> 00:49:20.286
If you're an app developer,

1126
00:49:20.836 --> 00:49:24.166
for your enterprise we've got
this great new page that talks

1127
00:49:24.166 --> 00:49:26.746
about how you can use
iOS to the best effect

1128
00:49:26.746 --> 00:49:29.016
within your enterprise
doing in-house development.

1129
00:49:30.306 --> 00:49:31.966
We have a number of
resources, again,

1130
00:49:31.966 --> 00:49:34.506
for developers both
MDM and app developers.

1131
00:49:34.706 --> 00:49:37.116
Our documentation
of or MDM protocol,

1132
00:49:37.116 --> 00:49:38.756
the configuration
profile reference,

1133
00:49:39.206 --> 00:49:40.596
the developer forums for MDM.

1134
00:49:40.596 --> 00:49:43.596
And if there are any
administrators out there,

1135
00:49:44.116 --> 00:49:46.976
we've got documentation for
the Device Enrollment Program

1136
00:49:47.106 --> 00:49:50.036
and Apple Configurator and a
number of discussion boards

1137
00:49:50.036 --> 00:49:52.436
that are great places to ask
your questions and get help,

1138
00:49:52.786 --> 00:49:54.646
both from your fellow
administrators

1139
00:49:54.646 --> 00:49:56.556
and Apple representatives.

1140
00:49:58.116 --> 00:50:01.466
There are a number of additional
sessions this week including 2

1141
00:49:58.116 --> 00:50:01.466
There are a number of additional
sessions this week including 2

1142
00:50:01.466 --> 00:50:03.826
following this session right
here in Pacific Heights.

1143
00:50:04.476 --> 00:50:07.896
Some of our colleagues that help
make that great new UI in iOS

1144
00:50:07.896 --> 00:50:09.526
and implement a lot
of these features.

1145
00:50:10.026 --> 00:50:12.306
And with that, I will thank
you for your attention

1146
00:50:12.306 --> 00:50:14.166
and hope you have a
great rest of the show.

1147
00:50:14.496 --> 00:50:14.856
Thank you.
