00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:11.276
>> Nathan de Vries:
Good afternoon everyone.

2
00:00:12.176 --> 00:00:14.866
My name's Nathan de Vries
[phonetic] and today I'm going

3
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:18.036
to be talking to you about iAd
Integration into your Apps.

4
00:00:18.726 --> 00:00:21.576
Now there are two major
opportunities the iAd presents

5
00:00:21.576 --> 00:00:22.696
to developers.

6
00:00:23.216 --> 00:00:25.556
The first is promoting
your applications

7
00:00:25.596 --> 00:00:28.546
with the new iAd
Workbench feature

8
00:00:28.546 --> 00:00:29.806
that was announced this week.

9
00:00:30.326 --> 00:00:34.326
And the second thing is
a revenue opportunity

10
00:00:34.326 --> 00:00:35.296
for your applications.

11
00:00:35.296 --> 00:00:39.066
So using application to generate
revenue through advertising,

12
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:41.216
and that's what we're going
to be talking about today.

13
00:00:41.586 --> 00:00:44.106
How to integrate iAds
into your applications

14
00:00:44.306 --> 00:00:45.396
to generate revenue.

15
00:00:45.396 --> 00:00:49.016
Now we're going to be doing
that by going through this flow.

16
00:00:49.246 --> 00:00:51.296
We're going to start by talking

17
00:00:51.296 --> 00:00:53.946
about the developer
benefits of iAd specifically.

18
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:56.686
Why it might be a
good choice for you

19
00:00:56.686 --> 00:00:58.616
to generate revenue
in your applications.

20
00:00:59.116 --> 00:01:01.536
Then we're going to look at some
core concepts that are critical

21
00:00:59.116 --> 00:01:01.536
Then we're going to look at some
core concepts that are critical

22
00:01:01.536 --> 00:01:05.706
in understanding why your
application is generating

23
00:01:05.706 --> 00:01:08.756
revenue in the way it is, how
you can improve on that revenue

24
00:01:08.756 --> 00:01:10.916
by making adjustments
to your application,

25
00:01:11.436 --> 00:01:12.266
and we're also going to go

26
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:14.996
into a little bit more detail
beyond those core concepts

27
00:01:15.276 --> 00:01:17.486
and talk about specific
things that you can do

28
00:01:17.486 --> 00:01:19.686
to optimize ad performance
in your applications.

29
00:01:20.286 --> 00:01:23.306
Next we're going to briefly look
at how to join the iAd network.

30
00:01:23.306 --> 00:01:24.356
It's very easy.

31
00:01:24.746 --> 00:01:28.006
And lastly, which is the major
chunk of the presentation

32
00:01:28.006 --> 00:01:30.846
which you're all here
for, is to look at some

33
00:01:30.846 --> 00:01:34.526
of the developer API's
for integrating iAds

34
00:01:34.526 --> 00:01:35.536
into your application.

35
00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:38.966
So let's start with
the developer benefits.

36
00:01:39.796 --> 00:01:43.496
First and foremost,
ignoring ads all together,

37
00:01:43.596 --> 00:01:46.396
you put huge amount of effort
into your applications,

38
00:01:46.396 --> 00:01:49.636
which they mix with applications
that have won the design awards,

39
00:01:50.636 --> 00:01:53.046
blood, sweat and tears get
poured into your applications.

40
00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:56.026
So you really want experiences
within your application

41
00:01:56.276 --> 00:01:58.386
that match the amount of
effort that you put in.

42
00:01:58.816 --> 00:02:02.196
So first and foremost, we really
want to delight your customers.

43
00:01:58.816 --> 00:02:02.196
So first and foremost, we really
want to delight your customers.

44
00:02:02.776 --> 00:02:05.776
So that's why the advertisements

45
00:02:05.776 --> 00:02:08.996
with iAd have very
high production values.

46
00:02:08.996 --> 00:02:11.926
We put a lot of attention
to detail into the ads

47
00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:16.436
so that your users get the same
beautiful enriched experiences

48
00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:18.266
that they expect from your app.

49
00:02:18.946 --> 00:02:24.106
As part of this rich experience,
iAd support media, playback,

50
00:02:24.106 --> 00:02:27.726
and game-type experiences,
really adding

51
00:02:27.726 --> 00:02:30.836
to the features of
your application.

52
00:02:32.686 --> 00:02:35.206
Like your application that
has access to amazing API's

53
00:02:35.206 --> 00:02:38.976
on the platform like Gyroscope
and Cameran and so on,

54
00:02:39.256 --> 00:02:41.906
ads also have access
to these API's.

55
00:02:41.906 --> 00:02:45.336
The ads are seamlessly
integrated with iOS' software

56
00:02:45.336 --> 00:02:48.906
and as hardware, so there's
not this sandboxed limited

57
00:02:48.906 --> 00:02:50.346
experience inside an ad.

58
00:02:50.666 --> 00:02:53.186
It's just an app.

59
00:02:53.446 --> 00:02:54.426
And this creates this kind

60
00:02:54.426 --> 00:02:56.696
of immersive experience
for the user.

61
00:02:56.916 --> 00:02:58.606
If they choose to
engage with an ad,

62
00:02:59.016 --> 00:03:01.266
it feels like this amazing
experience for them.

63
00:02:59.016 --> 00:03:01.266
it feels like this amazing
experience for them.

64
00:03:01.266 --> 00:03:02.936
And that's what we're
really trying to achieve.

65
00:03:03.486 --> 00:03:06.686
And you can see here the
types of examples of ads

66
00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:09.346
where you can really shake
the app and it interacts

67
00:03:09.346 --> 00:03:11.196
with the ad, or you
can play music

68
00:03:11.196 --> 00:03:13.206
or a game, watch move trailers.

69
00:03:13.536 --> 00:03:14.616
These are all the
kinds of things

70
00:03:14.616 --> 00:03:16.576
that advertisers are
providing in their ads.

71
00:03:17.436 --> 00:03:21.416
And lastly, even though when the
user engages in an ad and their

72
00:03:21.416 --> 00:03:24.166
in this [inaudible] experience,
their still in your app.

73
00:03:24.266 --> 00:03:27.106
So as soon as I dismiss
the ad, they're right back

74
00:03:27.176 --> 00:03:28.946
in your app where they left off.

75
00:03:28.946 --> 00:03:31.296
Just seamlessly in and
straight out again.

76
00:03:31.886 --> 00:03:38.236
So because the ad is inside
your app, we value the privacy

77
00:03:38.236 --> 00:03:40.556
of the users of your
application.

78
00:03:40.556 --> 00:03:43.326
This is why we request
permission before asking

79
00:03:43.326 --> 00:03:47.586
for contact access in your
application, or photo access,

80
00:03:47.626 --> 00:03:49.306
because we really
value the privacy

81
00:03:49.306 --> 00:03:51.576
of the users of your
application.

82
00:03:51.846 --> 00:03:54.456
Likewise, with advertising,
we also have

83
00:03:54.456 --> 00:03:57.316
that same approach to privacy.

84
00:03:57.316 --> 00:04:00.266
So we handle the privacy, so you
don't need to worry about it.

85
00:03:57.316 --> 00:04:00.266
So we handle the privacy, so you
don't need to worry about it.

86
00:04:00.676 --> 00:04:01.816
Users start using ads

87
00:04:01.816 --> 00:04:05.476
within your application have
the same privacy thought

88
00:04:05.476 --> 00:04:07.706
about that we do for your app.

89
00:04:09.576 --> 00:04:11.886
The world's best
brands are using iAd.

90
00:04:12.116 --> 00:04:16.786
So all around the world we have
agencies working with brands,

91
00:04:16.786 --> 00:04:19.156
winning design awards
for advertising,

92
00:04:19.416 --> 00:04:20.906
using the iAd platform.

93
00:04:21.286 --> 00:04:25.496
So all creating is, these brands
are very familiar to your users,

94
00:04:25.496 --> 00:04:28.116
so their much more likely to
engage in the advertising,

95
00:04:28.536 --> 00:04:32.796
and that really drives
the immersive experience

96
00:04:32.796 --> 00:04:33.566
for the users.

97
00:04:35.046 --> 00:04:38.196
Every year we're
expanding so far.

98
00:04:38.286 --> 00:04:41.476
We started in the U.S. We've
recently rolled out into Mexico.

99
00:04:41.476 --> 00:04:43.466
There's 11 countries
now that we support.

100
00:04:43.496 --> 00:04:48.706
So there's a great opportunity,
not just to advertise locally,

101
00:04:48.996 --> 00:04:50.386
but also broadly,
and we'll speak

102
00:04:50.386 --> 00:04:54.076
about that a little bit later.

103
00:04:54.076 --> 00:04:56.846
It's also a menu
here to work out how

104
00:04:56.846 --> 00:04:58.456
to monetize your application.

105
00:04:58.636 --> 00:05:00.076
It's a great path to revenue.

106
00:04:58.636 --> 00:05:00.076
It's a great path to revenue.

107
00:05:00.656 --> 00:05:02.836
When your application
displays an advertisement,

108
00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:06.536
the advertising revenue that's
generated from the display,

109
00:05:06.536 --> 00:05:10.266
and the interaction with those
ads, 70% of that revenue goes

110
00:05:10.266 --> 00:05:11.566
to you as a developer.

111
00:05:11.766 --> 00:05:14.516
So we think that's a really
great way for you to make money

112
00:05:14.516 --> 00:05:15.546
with your applications.

113
00:05:16.706 --> 00:05:20.356
And lastly, as developers, it's
incredibly easy to implement.

114
00:05:20.706 --> 00:05:22.426
You'll be able to jump to
that later on when we go

115
00:05:22.426 --> 00:05:25.496
into the developer
details, but we really feel

116
00:05:25.536 --> 00:05:27.886
like we've made it as
easy as possible for you

117
00:05:27.886 --> 00:05:29.526
to integrate ads into
your application.

118
00:05:31.056 --> 00:05:33.846
There's no need to link
against additional SDK's,

119
00:05:33.846 --> 00:05:37.536
so no need to maintain
and download other SDK's.

120
00:05:37.536 --> 00:05:42.556
You can be up and running in
really small amount of code.

121
00:05:42.556 --> 00:05:44.816
We also have some great sample
code which you'll notice

122
00:05:44.816 --> 00:05:47.896
on the developer@apple.com
website, which I'll link

123
00:05:47.896 --> 00:05:48.846
to a little bit later.

124
00:05:49.196 --> 00:05:52.636
This provides the iAd
Suite sample code,

125
00:05:52.636 --> 00:05:54.346
as well as developer
documentation.

126
00:05:54.576 --> 00:05:57.396
If you were to really dive
in and see examples of how

127
00:05:57.396 --> 00:05:59.276
to integrate ads into
your application.

128
00:06:00.036 --> 00:06:03.146
And lastly, we think that's
always been pretty easy

129
00:06:03.146 --> 00:06:05.686
to integrate ads, but we've
made it even easier this year

130
00:06:05.686 --> 00:06:06.806
with iOS 7.

131
00:06:06.806 --> 00:06:08.796
So we're looking
forward to your feedback

132
00:06:08.796 --> 00:06:09.796
on some of the new stuff.

133
00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:13.836
Next let's have a look
at some core concepts.

134
00:06:14.556 --> 00:06:16.746
Integrating iAds
into your application

135
00:06:16.746 --> 00:06:18.946
from a developer point of
view is incredibly easy.

136
00:06:19.046 --> 00:06:21.386
You'll get up and
running very quickly.

137
00:06:21.896 --> 00:06:25.396
But there are some core
concepts related to advertising

138
00:06:25.396 --> 00:06:28.316
and iAds specifically that
are useful to have in the back

139
00:06:28.316 --> 00:06:30.266
of your mind when you're
integrating the ads

140
00:06:30.566 --> 00:06:32.176
because once you've
shipped your application,

141
00:06:32.176 --> 00:06:34.276
it's in the app store, and
customers are using your app,

142
00:06:34.686 --> 00:06:36.466
you're going to need
to track the progress

143
00:06:36.466 --> 00:06:38.866
of revenue generated
by your app.

144
00:06:39.386 --> 00:06:41.816
So some of these core concepts
are going to keep coming

145
00:06:41.816 --> 00:06:45.406
up in your sales reports and
changes that you need to make

146
00:06:45.406 --> 00:06:46.896
to your application
to improve some

147
00:06:46.896 --> 00:06:48.956
of the ad performance,
so we'll start there.

148
00:06:49.996 --> 00:06:53.146
First of all, what is
the iAd App Network?

149
00:06:53.146 --> 00:06:56.066
Well we mentioned briefly
that there's the two things

150
00:06:56.066 --> 00:06:58.456
that that the iAd network
really provides to developers;

151
00:06:58.766 --> 00:07:00.936
the path to revenue, which
we're talking about today,

152
00:06:58.766 --> 00:07:00.936
the path to revenue, which
we're talking about today,

153
00:07:01.296 --> 00:07:04.276
and also the promotional
aspect promoting your app.

154
00:07:05.166 --> 00:07:09.426
So the iAd App Network is the
Apple business team working

155
00:07:09.426 --> 00:07:12.796
with advertisers to produce
inventory and delivering them

156
00:07:12.796 --> 00:07:15.126
to you, the developer
that's integrating iAds.

157
00:07:16.176 --> 00:07:17.986
So what does this look like?

158
00:07:18.216 --> 00:07:22.626
You've linked your application
against the iAd framework.

159
00:07:23.296 --> 00:07:26.416
What this means is that
the iAd framework is going

160
00:07:26.416 --> 00:07:28.806
to send requests to
the iAd App Network

161
00:07:28.806 --> 00:07:31.126
on your behalf asking ads.

162
00:07:31.746 --> 00:07:35.326
So we send ad requests to the
App Network, which replies,

163
00:07:35.716 --> 00:07:37.426
as you'd expect, with ads.

164
00:07:37.936 --> 00:07:42.286
So this combination of two
things: The requests being sent

165
00:07:42.286 --> 00:07:46.186
to the network and the ads being
sent back form this concept

166
00:07:46.186 --> 00:07:46.986
called the Fill Rate.

167
00:07:47.086 --> 00:07:48.136
Those of you that are familiar

168
00:07:48.136 --> 00:07:50.826
with advertising probably
have heard of this before,

169
00:07:51.176 --> 00:07:54.866
but this is the measure of
performance of requests sent

170
00:07:54.866 --> 00:07:57.466
by all of your applications,
versus the ads

171
00:07:57.466 --> 00:07:59.546
that are delivered
by the network.

172
00:07:59.666 --> 00:08:01.076
And we'll come back to
that when we're talking

173
00:07:59.666 --> 00:08:01.076
And we'll come back to
that when we're talking

174
00:08:01.076 --> 00:08:03.346
about improving app performance.

175
00:08:04.946 --> 00:08:08.286
Once you've been delivered an
ad, you still have to display it

176
00:08:08.286 --> 00:08:10.406
on the screen, so just
getting an ad isn't enough,

177
00:08:10.406 --> 00:08:11.496
you have to show it to the user.

178
00:08:11.766 --> 00:08:13.186
That's the point of this.

179
00:08:13.606 --> 00:08:15.296
So that's called an impression.

180
00:08:15.596 --> 00:08:17.636
As soon as you display
an ad to a user,

181
00:08:18.096 --> 00:08:21.476
it's called an impression,
and a certain percentage

182
00:08:21.476 --> 00:08:24.496
of those impressions will
hopefully turn into Tap Throughs

183
00:08:24.496 --> 00:08:26.036
when the user engages
with the ad.

184
00:08:26.676 --> 00:08:30.286
And these two concepts combined
are called the Tap Through rate.

185
00:08:30.286 --> 00:08:33.986
So the number of Tap Throughs,
versus the number of impressions

186
00:08:33.986 --> 00:08:35.226
that you're shown in your app.

187
00:08:35.226 --> 00:08:38.756
And you'll see these
as well in your reports

188
00:08:38.756 --> 00:08:41.466
when you're measuring the
performance of your app.

189
00:08:42.336 --> 00:08:44.056
So that's a few of
the core concepts.

190
00:08:44.056 --> 00:08:46.846
We'll refer back to them
later on in the presentation.

191
00:08:47.376 --> 00:08:49.986
Next let's look at some
tangible things that you can do

192
00:08:50.336 --> 00:08:52.136
to improve the ad performance

193
00:08:52.136 --> 00:08:54.966
of your application before you
even get started with the code.

194
00:08:58.046 --> 00:09:03.316
So first and foremost, it
all starts with a great app.

195
00:08:58.046 --> 00:09:03.316
So first and foremost, it
all starts with a great app.

196
00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:04.786
You need to focus
on the customer.

197
00:09:05.766 --> 00:09:08.516
Your app needs to have
utility and be useful,

198
00:09:08.626 --> 00:09:12.216
so ignoring the advertising side
of things, your app just has

199
00:09:12.216 --> 00:09:14.586
to be something that you
want lots of people to use.

200
00:09:14.936 --> 00:09:16.206
They find it really useful.

201
00:09:16.476 --> 00:09:17.676
They come back to it.

202
00:09:18.136 --> 00:09:20.116
There's loyalty associated
with your app.

203
00:09:20.196 --> 00:09:22.066
People just really have
to want to use our app.

204
00:09:22.386 --> 00:09:24.606
I'm recommending going
to some of the sessions

205
00:09:24.606 --> 00:09:28.336
on design during the conference,
or watching them on the videos,

206
00:09:28.656 --> 00:09:30.266
because honing is
part of your app.

207
00:09:30.266 --> 00:09:31.826
It is going to be a
key to the success

208
00:09:31.826 --> 00:09:33.746
of advertising in your app.

209
00:09:34.726 --> 00:09:36.946
Having a great app, or
something that's worth talking

210
00:09:36.946 --> 00:09:38.826
about will generate
network effects.

211
00:09:38.866 --> 00:09:40.836
So you'll start getting
reviews on the app store,

212
00:09:40.836 --> 00:09:42.086
people will talk about your app,

213
00:09:42.586 --> 00:09:45.676
and all of these things
result in more ad requests.

214
00:09:46.156 --> 00:09:49.816
So as a side effect of focusing
on the customer and your app,

215
00:09:50.396 --> 00:09:52.876
you're immediately going
to get more ad requests,

216
00:09:53.286 --> 00:09:57.266
more ads served, which
is better for your app.

217
00:09:58.336 --> 00:10:02.076
The next thing that you can
do is to place ads smartly.

218
00:09:58.336 --> 00:10:02.076
The next thing that you can
do is to place ads smartly.

219
00:10:02.686 --> 00:10:04.666
Key here is not place
ads everywhere.

220
00:10:04.846 --> 00:10:08.116
You have to really
consider user context,

221
00:10:08.816 --> 00:10:12.036
as well as recognizing high
use areas in your application,

222
00:10:12.136 --> 00:10:14.646
so when you're looking
at a holistic view

223
00:10:14.646 --> 00:10:15.576
of your application,

224
00:10:15.576 --> 00:10:17.986
really consider is
this view appropriate

225
00:10:17.986 --> 00:10:20.626
to advertising how
many users are entering

226
00:10:20.626 --> 00:10:22.866
into this part of my app.

227
00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:25.296
You want to avoid
accidental taps.

228
00:10:25.536 --> 00:10:27.656
So placing ads in spots

229
00:10:27.656 --> 00:10:31.856
where users might accidently
tap the ad isn't a good thing

230
00:10:31.856 --> 00:10:33.186
because it might
be an impression,

231
00:10:33.186 --> 00:10:35.976
but if people are tapping on the
ad and immediately dismissing it

232
00:10:35.976 --> 00:10:37.066
because it was a mistake?

233
00:10:37.446 --> 00:10:39.686
That's not going to be very
good for your ad performance.

234
00:10:41.036 --> 00:10:43.116
And really keep in
the back of your mind

235
00:10:43.116 --> 00:10:45.466
when you're designing your
apps and integration of ads

236
00:10:45.466 --> 00:10:48.786
into your apps, that user
context is incredibly important.

237
00:10:49.196 --> 00:10:52.626
So you really need to weigh up
the benefit of an impression

238
00:10:52.956 --> 00:10:55.226
versus what the user
was trying to do

239
00:10:55.226 --> 00:10:56.486
when you were showing that ad.

240
00:10:56.696 --> 00:10:59.576
So things like showing
advertisements

241
00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:00.616
during registration.

242
00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:00.616
during registration.

243
00:11:00.616 --> 00:11:02.246
Maybe you want to
show advertisements

244
00:11:02.246 --> 00:11:04.306
after registration
because the success

245
00:11:04.306 --> 00:11:07.056
of your app is predicated
on someone signing up,

246
00:11:07.376 --> 00:11:09.346
enjoying the app, and
coming back to the app,

247
00:11:09.726 --> 00:11:12.406
which will produce more
advertising revenue for you.

248
00:11:13.216 --> 00:11:15.496
You should also consider
customer location.

249
00:11:16.036 --> 00:11:19.346
I mentioned that we support
11 different countries

250
00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:19.916
at the moment.

251
00:11:20.696 --> 00:11:22.666
So you should take
this into account

252
00:11:22.666 --> 00:11:24.526
when you're planning
your marketing strategy.

253
00:11:25.096 --> 00:11:28.826
If you're only serving your
app to, say, the states,

254
00:11:29.136 --> 00:11:31.706
then maybe you should consider
serving to other regions

255
00:11:31.766 --> 00:11:35.516
because these regions will
also be sending ad requests,

256
00:11:35.786 --> 00:11:37.326
but not getting anything back.

257
00:11:37.326 --> 00:11:39.676
Or they might not even have
the app available in the store.

258
00:11:39.886 --> 00:11:41.946
So really consider where
you're submitting your app,

259
00:11:42.016 --> 00:11:43.636
to which stores, and take

260
00:11:43.636 --> 00:11:46.326
into account these iAd
App Network countries.

261
00:11:47.546 --> 00:11:48.496
One thing that you can do

262
00:11:48.496 --> 00:11:51.456
with this is target your
marketing to those countries.

263
00:11:51.746 --> 00:11:54.376
So if you've never thought
about advertising specifically

264
00:11:54.376 --> 00:11:57.126
to a particular country, maybe
you should try doing that?

265
00:11:57.126 --> 00:11:59.556
That will increase the number
of customers in that country,

266
00:11:59.776 --> 00:12:01.756
and really drive up
those ad requests,

267
00:11:59.776 --> 00:12:01.756
and really drive up
those ad requests,

268
00:12:01.966 --> 00:12:04.456
and assist with optimizing
the ad performance

269
00:12:04.456 --> 00:12:05.366
of your application.

270
00:12:06.126 --> 00:12:08.096
You could even consider
going a step further

271
00:12:08.096 --> 00:12:10.446
and localizing your
applications.

272
00:12:10.866 --> 00:12:12.446
The last country that we rolled

273
00:12:12.446 --> 00:12:15.476
out the iAd App Network
to was Mexico.

274
00:12:15.986 --> 00:12:19.106
It's right next door and
you could localize our app

275
00:12:19.106 --> 00:12:22.676
in Spanish, and immediately
get access to a whole bunch

276
00:12:22.676 --> 00:12:25.296
of customers that you would
never have had access to before.

277
00:12:25.736 --> 00:12:29.016
Driving up ad requests,
impressions, Tap Throughs,

278
00:12:29.336 --> 00:12:31.186
and improving your
app performance.

279
00:12:33.406 --> 00:12:34.386
Another thing that you need

280
00:12:34.386 --> 00:12:38.006
to consider is the
seasonality of advertising.

281
00:12:38.516 --> 00:12:40.816
Consumer spending throughout
the year fluctuates,

282
00:12:41.136 --> 00:12:44.776
so as does advertising spending.

283
00:12:44.856 --> 00:12:48.176
Advertising spending kind of
tracks consumer spending, right?

284
00:12:48.866 --> 00:12:50.866
So you should also
market accordingly.

285
00:12:51.056 --> 00:12:53.646
If you know that there's going
to be a holiday period coming

286
00:12:53.646 --> 00:12:55.716
up where spending is
going to be increased,

287
00:12:55.986 --> 00:12:58.266
maybe you should focus
your marketing attention

288
00:12:58.456 --> 00:12:59.706
to that time of the year.

289
00:12:59.706 --> 00:13:01.466
Increase a little bit of
your marketing budget,

290
00:12:59.706 --> 00:13:01.466
Increase a little bit of
your marketing budget,

291
00:13:02.086 --> 00:13:05.346
get some more customers into
your apps at that point in time,

292
00:13:05.686 --> 00:13:10.846
and then you'll get more
requests at that time.

293
00:13:10.886 --> 00:13:13.546
And, I guess the one
thing to take away

294
00:13:13.546 --> 00:13:16.516
from this is it's a very,
it's a feedback loop.

295
00:13:17.656 --> 00:13:20.416
As you drive more customers
to your app, you're going

296
00:13:20.416 --> 00:13:23.546
to get more ad requests, which
are going to result in more ads,

297
00:13:24.246 --> 00:13:26.986
which in turn turns into
impressions, and Tap Throughs,

298
00:13:27.086 --> 00:13:29.716
and the iAd App Network
will use all of these things

299
00:13:29.716 --> 00:13:32.386
to decide should I send
more ads to this app?

300
00:13:32.776 --> 00:13:34.416
How many ads should
I send to this app?

301
00:13:34.816 --> 00:13:38.486
So a really healthy
app is one that works

302
00:13:38.486 --> 00:13:41.776
with this feedback loop that
really drives as many customers

303
00:13:41.776 --> 00:13:45.636
as possible, creates
loyalty, and gets more ads.

304
00:13:46.276 --> 00:13:49.676
So that's a little bit about
optimizing ad performance.

305
00:13:49.676 --> 00:13:53.316
You might be wondering, well how
do I join the iAd App Network?

306
00:13:53.936 --> 00:13:55.906
It's pretty easy.

307
00:13:56.556 --> 00:13:59.766
If you've submitted an app
before, you would have gone

308
00:13:59.766 --> 00:14:01.396
to the iTunes Connect website,

309
00:13:59.766 --> 00:14:01.396
to the iTunes Connect website,

310
00:14:01.396 --> 00:14:05.936
so the iAd preferences
configured in the same place.

311
00:14:06.526 --> 00:14:09.526
All you need to do is
complete the iAd contract once.

312
00:14:09.526 --> 00:14:11.596
And then on a per app basis,

313
00:14:11.596 --> 00:14:15.416
you need to enable iAd
specifically for that app.

314
00:14:15.716 --> 00:14:17.276
One thing to bear in
mind is that you need

315
00:14:17.276 --> 00:14:18.996
to do this before
you submit your app.

316
00:14:19.316 --> 00:14:22.526
So before you've finished
developing your app

317
00:14:22.526 --> 00:14:25.466
and maybe you want to
create the descriptions

318
00:14:25.466 --> 00:14:28.836
and the screenshots, and so
on, the App Store details

319
00:14:28.836 --> 00:14:32.126
for your app, make sure you
enable iAd before you submit the

320
00:14:32.126 --> 00:14:33.516
binary for our application.

321
00:14:34.086 --> 00:14:39.266
So that's a little bit about
joining the iAd App Network.

322
00:14:39.816 --> 00:14:41.626
Let's dig in to some of
the developer details

323
00:14:41.626 --> 00:14:45.136
about integrating apps
into your application.

324
00:14:45.916 --> 00:14:47.626
And to start with,
what we're going

325
00:14:47.626 --> 00:14:50.856
to do is talk about banners.

326
00:14:51.806 --> 00:14:55.616
The banner ad is a
slim device with view.

327
00:14:56.046 --> 00:14:57.726
Sits at the bottom
of your content view.

328
00:14:58.676 --> 00:14:59.836
And you can see one here.

329
00:15:00.986 --> 00:15:03.386
It's typically a place at
the bottom of your content,

330
00:15:03.386 --> 00:15:06.886
but remember back to the smart
placement bit of the talk

331
00:15:06.886 --> 00:15:10.476
where you can adjust this
depending on music context

332
00:15:10.476 --> 00:15:14.026
to avoid accidental
taps, but our guidance is

333
00:15:14.106 --> 00:15:16.286
that it generally goes to
the bottom of the content.

334
00:15:16.796 --> 00:15:21.976
As new ads become available,
the banner continuously loads,

335
00:15:22.056 --> 00:15:26.146
so if your user passes out of
network access and comes back

336
00:15:26.146 --> 00:15:29.536
into network access, these
banners will automatically bring

337
00:15:29.536 --> 00:15:32.256
in new ads, and roll on and
off the screen automatically.

338
00:15:32.256 --> 00:15:35.526
When you tap one
of these banners,

339
00:15:35.526 --> 00:15:37.966
you get a full screen
immersive ad experience.

340
00:15:38.456 --> 00:15:41.716
And lastly these
banner ads are supported

341
00:15:41.716 --> 00:15:43.386
on both iPhone and iPad.

342
00:15:43.576 --> 00:15:45.696
So you can use them
in both contexts.

343
00:15:46.536 --> 00:15:49.446
To integrate these banners,
there's three easy steps.

344
00:15:49.736 --> 00:15:53.826
First you need to link the iAd
framework, which is pretty easy.

345
00:15:53.826 --> 00:15:55.586
We're going to get a
demonstration of that soon.

346
00:15:56.486 --> 00:15:58.936
You need to import the iAd
header from the framework.

347
00:15:59.906 --> 00:16:02.916
And lastly, you need to
choose the view controllers

348
00:15:59.906 --> 00:16:02.916
And lastly, you need to
choose the view controllers

349
00:16:02.956 --> 00:16:07.106
in your application that are
appropriate for advertising.

350
00:16:07.966 --> 00:16:11.476
So what I mentioned
before, that you had an app

351
00:16:11.476 --> 00:16:12.906
with the banner view
across the bottom,

352
00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:16.196
you should consider each
screen of your application

353
00:16:16.646 --> 00:16:21.016
as being appropriate or
inappropriate to the banner ads.

354
00:16:21.316 --> 00:16:23.966
And we've got this new API
and iOS 7 that allows you

355
00:16:23.966 --> 00:16:26.746
to set a flag on any of your
View Controllers to say,

356
00:16:26.746 --> 00:16:28.606
I would like banner
ads to be displayed

357
00:16:29.056 --> 00:16:30.046
in this View Controller.

358
00:16:30.916 --> 00:16:34.946
So we set the canDislayBannerAds
property to yes.

359
00:16:35.446 --> 00:16:39.096
And what this does is
it takes the root view,

360
00:16:39.336 --> 00:16:42.886
or the top level view
of your View Controller,

361
00:16:43.376 --> 00:16:45.866
and it becomes the
originalContentView.

362
00:16:46.026 --> 00:16:47.306
It becomes a mute property.

363
00:16:48.366 --> 00:16:52.176
This allows us to wrap
your View Controller's view

364
00:16:52.636 --> 00:16:56.056
in a Framework View which
allows us to animate the banner

365
00:16:56.206 --> 00:16:57.216
on and off the screen.

366
00:16:58.136 --> 00:17:01.536
So when you sent the
canDisplayBannerAds property

367
00:16:58.136 --> 00:17:01.536
So when you sent the
canDisplayBannerAds property

368
00:17:01.536 --> 00:17:04.935
to yes, we wrap your
view in another view.

369
00:17:05.806 --> 00:17:09.136
We start sending ad requests
to the network saying we would

370
00:17:09.136 --> 00:17:12.596
like banner ads for
this particular device.

371
00:17:13.746 --> 00:17:16.906
When the banner loads, so we
get an ad back from the network,

372
00:17:17.776 --> 00:17:20.396
the banner moves on
screen, adjusting the size

373
00:17:20.396 --> 00:17:21.886
of your original content view.

374
00:17:22.695 --> 00:17:24.665
So the one thing you
need to keep in mind is

375
00:17:24.665 --> 00:17:28.006
if you're referring to that
original view, you now need

376
00:17:28.006 --> 00:17:30.646
to change all of your calls to
view on your View Controller

377
00:17:30.646 --> 00:17:32.096
to originalContentView.

378
00:17:32.546 --> 00:17:33.696
And you also need to make sure

379
00:17:33.696 --> 00:17:37.076
that your originalContentView
respects Relay Out,

380
00:17:37.626 --> 00:17:39.826
accommodating a new banner ad.

381
00:17:41.306 --> 00:17:42.976
Once the banner is
on the screen,

382
00:17:43.156 --> 00:17:46.166
the user has an opportunity
to tap on it.

383
00:17:46.356 --> 00:17:49.096
So we get that full screen
ad experience on tap.

384
00:17:49.916 --> 00:17:51.526
When the ad appears
on the screen,

385
00:17:51.526 --> 00:17:54.466
you get the usual appearance
and disappearance callbacks

386
00:17:54.466 --> 00:17:55.456
on your View Controller.

387
00:17:55.986 --> 00:17:57.456
So what you should do

388
00:17:57.546 --> 00:18:01.186
in the viewWillDisappear
callback is poise

389
00:17:57.546 --> 00:18:01.186
in the viewWillDisappear
callback is poise

390
00:18:01.186 --> 00:18:05.016
and intensive media
activities, sounds, and so on,

391
00:18:05.166 --> 00:18:07.166
that would interrupt
with the ad experience.

392
00:18:07.306 --> 00:18:10.766
Because your goal is to have the
user enjoy the ad experience,

393
00:18:10.766 --> 00:18:14.176
and not feel like the
app is using up CPU,

394
00:18:14.176 --> 00:18:17.156
slowing things down, because
that disrupts the ad experience.

395
00:18:18.126 --> 00:18:22.136
When the full screen
advertisement is dismissed,

396
00:18:22.746 --> 00:18:26.176
then this is a good time to
resume any immediate activity

397
00:18:26.486 --> 00:18:28.526
that you had running
in your app.

398
00:18:28.776 --> 00:18:31.036
So now we've got
an ad on screen.

399
00:18:31.036 --> 00:18:34.326
The user passes out of
network connectivity,

400
00:18:34.546 --> 00:18:36.846
or there's no longer
ad Inventory available

401
00:18:36.846 --> 00:18:39.566
to your app, the ad unloads.

402
00:18:40.236 --> 00:18:41.426
So when the ad unloads,

403
00:18:41.426 --> 00:18:44.646
the banner is moved off-screen
automatically by the framework,

404
00:18:45.226 --> 00:18:48.456
and your original content view
is resized much in the same way

405
00:18:48.456 --> 00:18:53.586
as it was resized when it
was bought on the screen.

406
00:18:53.586 --> 00:18:54.976
So you've got these
View Controllers

407
00:18:54.976 --> 00:18:57.296
and they're all configured,
or some of them are configured

408
00:18:57.296 --> 00:18:58.876
with canDislayBannerAds.

409
00:18:59.116 --> 00:19:00.426
There are certain circumstances

410
00:18:59.116 --> 00:19:00.426
There are certain circumstances

411
00:19:00.426 --> 00:19:03.236
where you want a
temporarily disable banner ads

412
00:19:03.236 --> 00:19:05.836
on a particular View Controller.

413
00:19:06.096 --> 00:19:07.406
So we support that as well.

414
00:19:08.496 --> 00:19:11.046
You simply need to set
the property back to No.

415
00:19:11.706 --> 00:19:14.136
And when you're finished
with the app context,

416
00:19:14.136 --> 00:19:17.696
where it's inappropriate for
a banner ad to be displayed,

417
00:19:18.156 --> 00:19:22.256
or not ideal for a banner ad to
be displayed, then you can set

418
00:19:22.256 --> 00:19:23.936
that property back to Yes.

419
00:19:24.426 --> 00:19:26.496
Don't forget to re-enable.

420
00:19:26.836 --> 00:19:33.726
Yes. We provide some great tools
for testing during development.

421
00:19:33.726 --> 00:19:36.406
In the Developer Settings
pane on the device,

422
00:19:36.806 --> 00:19:39.326
we have these two
great facilities

423
00:19:39.686 --> 00:19:41.046
for adjusting the Fill Rate,

424
00:19:41.336 --> 00:19:43.156
which we mentioned
in the core concepts.

425
00:19:43.666 --> 00:19:46.716
This allows you to
configure your application

426
00:19:46.716 --> 00:19:48.256
so that it never gets ads.

427
00:19:48.256 --> 00:19:51.066
It always gets ads or
some variation in between.

428
00:19:51.366 --> 00:19:54.516
This is as this was with
testing of your app.

429
00:19:54.726 --> 00:19:57.076
You can also adjust
the Refresh Rate.

430
00:19:57.526 --> 00:20:01.136
So this is how quickly ads cycle
in and out of your application.

431
00:19:57.526 --> 00:20:01.136
So this is how quickly ads cycle
in and out of your application.

432
00:20:02.266 --> 00:20:03.526
One thing to bear in mind is

433
00:20:03.526 --> 00:20:05.536
that this only affects
your apps.

434
00:20:05.856 --> 00:20:08.226
So if you're carrying
a development device

435
00:20:08.226 --> 00:20:11.166
and you total these Fill Rate
and Refresh Rate settings,

436
00:20:11.806 --> 00:20:15.266
and then you run another
person's app from the store

437
00:20:15.266 --> 00:20:17.896
that has iAds, it's not
going to affect the Fill Rate

438
00:20:17.896 --> 00:20:19.276
and Refresh Rate of that app.

439
00:20:19.276 --> 00:20:23.156
It's only apps that are
installed by you as a developer.

440
00:20:23.676 --> 00:20:27.916
I'd like to bring
up David Wilson

441
00:20:27.916 --> 00:20:29.596
to give us a demonstration
of how

442
00:20:29.596 --> 00:20:31.346
to integrate banner ads
into our application.

443
00:20:31.826 --> 00:20:33.846
>> David Wilson: So now that
we've talked about banner ads,

444
00:20:33.986 --> 00:20:36.696
we're going to take a quick look
at a demo, just how easy it is

445
00:20:36.696 --> 00:20:38.326
to take an existing application

446
00:20:38.606 --> 00:20:40.086
and add this functionality
to it.

447
00:20:40.586 --> 00:20:42.746
To do that, we're going to start
off with a simple application.

448
00:20:42.746 --> 00:20:44.136
It's just two View Controllers.

449
00:20:44.136 --> 00:20:45.926
It's a master detail.

450
00:20:45.996 --> 00:20:48.456
The first one's going to show
a list of article headlines,

451
00:20:48.756 --> 00:20:50.976
and when you tap on one of those
article headlines, you're going

452
00:20:50.976 --> 00:20:53.296
to go into New View
Controller that shows

453
00:20:53.296 --> 00:20:54.706
that article in a web view.

454
00:20:54.706 --> 00:20:58.176
What we want to do in the
first part of this demo is

455
00:20:58.176 --> 00:21:02.516
to add a banner view to the
bottom of the list of articles.

456
00:20:58.176 --> 00:21:02.516
to add a banner view to the
bottom of the list of articles.

457
00:21:02.956 --> 00:21:07.396
So I'm going to go ahead and
pop open the iOS Simulator here,

458
00:21:07.396 --> 00:21:10.456
and this is the application
before we started doing anything

459
00:21:10.456 --> 00:21:10.806
to it.

460
00:21:11.256 --> 00:21:14.596
We've got top news here,
a list of quick articles.

461
00:21:14.596 --> 00:21:17.316
We can click on one of these and
we've got ourselves an article.

462
00:21:17.446 --> 00:21:19.276
So let's see what we need to do

463
00:21:19.276 --> 00:21:21.746
to add iAd Support
to this application.

464
00:21:22.206 --> 00:21:23.986
We're going to hide
this, go back,

465
00:21:23.986 --> 00:21:26.206
to Xcode to bring
up our project.

466
00:21:26.206 --> 00:21:28.486
And the first thing that
we need to do is link

467
00:21:28.486 --> 00:21:29.736
against the iAd framework.

468
00:21:29.736 --> 00:21:32.066
So we're going to make sure
we've got our project selected.

469
00:21:32.456 --> 00:21:34.036
Select the appropriate
target here.

470
00:21:34.076 --> 00:21:35.676
And go over the Build
Phases Tab.

471
00:21:36.656 --> 00:21:37.806
Click the Plus Button.

472
00:21:38.106 --> 00:21:40.356
We can find the iAd Framework.

473
00:21:41.316 --> 00:21:42.916
And go ahead and add
that to our project.

474
00:21:43.176 --> 00:21:46.196
The next thing that
we need to do is go

475
00:21:46.196 --> 00:21:52.786
into our Master View Controller
here and Import the iAd Header.

476
00:21:52.866 --> 00:21:54.306
That gives us access to the API,

477
00:21:54.506 --> 00:21:57.076
specifically the
CanDislayBannerAds Property

478
00:21:57.436 --> 00:21:58.426
on View Controller.

479
00:21:59.056 --> 00:22:02.116
Once we've done that, all we
need to do is set that property

480
00:21:59.056 --> 00:22:02.116
Once we've done that, all we
need to do is set that property

481
00:22:02.406 --> 00:22:04.746
on the View Controller
when it wakes up.

482
00:22:05.536 --> 00:22:08.196
We can go ahead and save.

483
00:22:09.096 --> 00:22:12.526
We can re-run our demo here.

484
00:22:16.336 --> 00:22:18.576
Now you'll see that
automatically.

485
00:22:18.576 --> 00:22:21.496
An ad pops in from the bottom as
soon as the ad request is made,

486
00:22:21.496 --> 00:22:24.556
and a new ad has loaded
into your application.

487
00:22:24.696 --> 00:22:29.406
If we were to lose network
connectivity and this were

488
00:22:29.406 --> 00:22:32.436
to cycle back out, you'd see it
just animate out smoothly just

489
00:22:32.436 --> 00:22:34.086
as well as it animated in.

490
00:22:34.856 --> 00:22:38.836
And with that, I'll bring Nathan
back up to continue the slides.

491
00:22:39.046 --> 00:22:39.806
>> Nathan de Vries:
Thanks, David.

492
00:22:40.236 --> 00:22:43.216
As you can see, it's pretty
easy to enable banner ads.

493
00:22:43.286 --> 00:22:45.206
Just a simple property.

494
00:22:45.206 --> 00:22:46.246
Very easy to do.

495
00:22:46.766 --> 00:22:47.756
Pretty cool.

496
00:22:47.756 --> 00:22:49.276
This is new in iOS 7.

497
00:22:49.666 --> 00:22:52.246
So next we're going to talk
about a different type of ad.

498
00:22:52.326 --> 00:22:54.656
We've seen a banner
ad which when tapped,

499
00:22:54.776 --> 00:22:56.816
presents a full screen
advertisement.

500
00:22:57.266 --> 00:22:58.896
The Interstitial is a
little bit different,

501
00:22:58.896 --> 00:22:59.826
in that it doesn't have

502
00:22:59.826 --> 00:23:02.326
that intermediary
view that you tap on.

503
00:22:59.826 --> 00:23:02.326
that intermediary
view that you tap on.

504
00:23:02.726 --> 00:23:06.376
It immediately launches into
a full-screen advertisement.

505
00:23:07.166 --> 00:23:09.826
So what usually happens
is, as you're transitioning

506
00:23:09.826 --> 00:23:12.806
from one part of your
application into another part,

507
00:23:13.316 --> 00:23:16.496
you get this full-screen
advertisement up here.

508
00:23:16.626 --> 00:23:18.946
So this is pretty cool.

509
00:23:19.626 --> 00:23:24.426
This has been available since
iOS 4.3 on iPad, as of iOS 7,

510
00:23:24.426 --> 00:23:26.966
this is all also
available on the iPhone,

511
00:23:27.556 --> 00:23:30.236
so you can start using
this today on iPhone too.

512
00:23:31.636 --> 00:23:35.076
Now when I talk about
automatic presentation

513
00:23:35.076 --> 00:23:37.496
of a full-screen view,
when does that happen?

514
00:23:37.646 --> 00:23:40.716
As of iOS 7, we now
have this new property

515
00:23:40.716 --> 00:23:42.966
on View Controller
similar to the property

516
00:23:43.156 --> 00:23:46.836
on the banner ads
called the Interstitial

517
00:23:46.836 --> 00:23:48.096
Presentation Policy.

518
00:23:48.446 --> 00:23:52.376
And what the iAd framework is
now able to do for you is watch

519
00:23:52.376 --> 00:23:54.696
for View Controllers
to become visible,

520
00:23:55.126 --> 00:23:57.556
and then present an
interstitial ad automatically

521
00:23:57.886 --> 00:23:59.336
when that view becomes visible.

522
00:24:00.316 --> 00:24:02.586
So if you've got
a view controller,

523
00:24:02.586 --> 00:24:04.166
we can say there's two
View Controllers here;

524
00:24:04.166 --> 00:24:07.086
one is off-screen, the current
View Controller on-screen,

525
00:24:07.156 --> 00:24:08.866
and the next View
Controller off-screen.

526
00:24:09.456 --> 00:24:12.136
We want to configure the
Interstitial Presentation Policy

527
00:24:12.206 --> 00:24:14.886
of the next View
Controller to be automatic.

528
00:24:15.156 --> 00:24:16.356
We want the iAd framework

529
00:24:16.356 --> 00:24:18.926
to automatically manage
presentation of an interstitial

530
00:24:19.276 --> 00:24:24.066
when it's appropriate based
on inventory and minimum time

531
00:24:24.066 --> 00:24:25.776
between interstitial
presentations.

532
00:24:26.706 --> 00:24:29.426
Now when we call
pushViewController to present

533
00:24:29.426 --> 00:24:31.426
that View Controller,

534
00:24:32.006 --> 00:24:34.306
an interstitial is
automatically presented on top.

535
00:24:35.246 --> 00:24:38.886
When the user dismisses the
full-screen interstitial,

536
00:24:39.236 --> 00:24:40.916
they're back to that
next View Controller.

537
00:24:40.916 --> 00:24:43.326
They're back into the app.

538
00:24:43.586 --> 00:24:46.466
There's also another option for
applications that are doing,

539
00:24:46.686 --> 00:24:49.366
maybe single View
Controller style,

540
00:24:49.436 --> 00:24:51.456
have the single View
Controller architecture.

541
00:24:51.866 --> 00:24:55.266
Things like games, where
you need to have control

542
00:24:55.266 --> 00:24:56.806
over the presentation
of the interstitial

543
00:24:56.806 --> 00:25:00.006
because there's no View
Controller transitions.

544
00:24:56.806 --> 00:25:00.006
because there's no View
Controller transitions.

545
00:25:00.036 --> 00:25:02.126
So what you need to
do there is instead

546
00:25:02.126 --> 00:25:04.366
of setting an automatic
Interstitial Presentation

547
00:25:04.366 --> 00:25:07.316
Policy, you set a Manual
Presentation Policy.

548
00:25:07.936 --> 00:25:10.476
And what this does, is it
still enables interstitials

549
00:25:10.476 --> 00:25:13.286
to present automatically
and seamlessly, but you need

550
00:25:13.286 --> 00:25:15.106
to request the presentation.

551
00:25:15.676 --> 00:25:18.556
So if you're building a
game style application,

552
00:25:19.006 --> 00:25:22.186
when you transition
from, say, the game back

553
00:25:22.186 --> 00:25:24.476
into the menu would
be one example.

554
00:25:24.696 --> 00:25:27.036
You can call Request
Interstitial Presentation,

555
00:25:27.036 --> 00:25:31.936
and if an ad is available,
it will present.

556
00:25:31.936 --> 00:25:34.396
One thing to bear in mind
with interstitial ads is

557
00:25:34.396 --> 00:25:38.176
that when you're setting this
property on View Controllers

558
00:25:38.176 --> 00:25:40.146
that might happen quite a while

559
00:25:40.146 --> 00:25:42.006
after the user has
launched the application.

560
00:25:42.546 --> 00:25:45.226
Setting the property on a View
Controller is really the only

561
00:25:45.226 --> 00:25:47.356
way for the iAd framework
to know

562
00:25:47.356 --> 00:25:49.706
that ad requests
should stop being sent

563
00:25:49.776 --> 00:25:51.116
to the iAd App Network.

564
00:25:51.616 --> 00:25:54.336
So what you can do
to improve on this is

565
00:25:54.336 --> 00:25:57.976
to call Prepare Interstitial
Ads early

566
00:25:57.976 --> 00:25:59.786
on in your application's
lifecycle

567
00:25:59.786 --> 00:26:02.216
so that you don't miss
those early impressions.

568
00:25:59.786 --> 00:26:02.216
so that you don't miss
those early impressions.

569
00:26:02.876 --> 00:26:05.546
And with that, I'm going

570
00:26:05.546 --> 00:26:07.516
to bring David back
up to do a demo.

571
00:26:07.796 --> 00:26:08.066
>> David Wilson: Okay.

572
00:26:08.066 --> 00:26:08.766
So we're going to go back

573
00:26:08.866 --> 00:26:10.606
to the application we
just took a look at,

574
00:26:10.606 --> 00:26:13.016
and we added a banner view
to the bottom of the list

575
00:26:13.016 --> 00:26:15.846
of articles, and now we want to
add interstitial presentation

576
00:26:16.206 --> 00:26:18.586
when the user taps on one
of those articles to go

577
00:26:18.586 --> 00:26:19.986
into the actual article view.

578
00:26:20.356 --> 00:26:22.966
We can go back, remember, and
this is what our app looked

579
00:26:22.966 --> 00:26:24.556
like when we last left it.

580
00:26:24.556 --> 00:26:26.226
We've got ads at the
bottom, and you can see

581
00:26:26.226 --> 00:26:27.186
that they're cycling there.

582
00:26:27.746 --> 00:26:29.876
We can go back to Xcode.

583
00:26:30.426 --> 00:26:33.386
Now as Nathan mentioned,
it's important to tell iAd

584
00:26:33.386 --> 00:26:37.286
that you're going to want to
present interstitial as early

585
00:26:37.286 --> 00:26:39.036
as possible in the
app's lifecycle.

586
00:26:39.486 --> 00:26:43.576
That allows iAd to go ahead and
make ad requests on your behalf

587
00:26:43.576 --> 00:26:46.976
so that an interstitial is ready
when the user takes the action

588
00:26:46.976 --> 00:26:48.756
that would present it.

589
00:26:49.256 --> 00:26:51.316
So the first thing we're going
to do is we're going to go

590
00:26:51.316 --> 00:26:53.076
over to our app delegate.

591
00:26:54.386 --> 00:26:57.536
We're going to import
the iAd Header here,

592
00:26:57.536 --> 00:27:00.866
and then inside our app
delegates did finish launching

593
00:26:57.536 --> 00:27:00.866
and then inside our app
delegates did finish launching

594
00:27:01.036 --> 00:27:02.186
with Options Call.

595
00:27:02.566 --> 00:27:04.836
We want to go ahead and
call UI View Controller,

596
00:27:04.836 --> 00:27:06.626
Prepare Interstitial Ads.

597
00:27:07.276 --> 00:27:10.926
This allows iAd to begin
making those ad requests

598
00:27:11.196 --> 00:27:12.626
at the beginning of
your application.

599
00:27:12.626 --> 00:27:14.936
That means the moment
the user takes action,

600
00:27:15.176 --> 00:27:16.876
we're going to have
ads available for you.

601
00:27:18.216 --> 00:27:19.846
Once we've done that,
we can go back

602
00:27:19.846 --> 00:27:21.356
to our Master View
Controller here,

603
00:27:21.356 --> 00:27:23.586
and we've already
imported the iAd Header,

604
00:27:23.656 --> 00:27:24.746
which was the important bit.

605
00:27:24.746 --> 00:27:29.326
And we go down to the bottom
of this to prepare for segue.

606
00:27:29.616 --> 00:27:32.026
Here we've set up our
Detail View Controller.

607
00:27:32.136 --> 00:27:34.176
We've set the Article URL on it.

608
00:27:34.606 --> 00:27:36.546
And once we've done
that, we just also need

609
00:27:36.546 --> 00:27:37.926
to set one more property,

610
00:27:37.966 --> 00:27:40.686
which is the Interstitial
Presentation Policy.

611
00:27:41.576 --> 00:27:44.026
And once we've done
that, we can save again.

612
00:27:44.126 --> 00:27:46.916
We can go ahead and Run.

613
00:27:52.046 --> 00:27:54.076
Okay. So we've got our
application back up.

614
00:27:54.206 --> 00:27:57.066
Give it a second and the
banner should kick in here.

615
00:27:57.666 --> 00:27:59.646
And then behind the scenes,

616
00:27:59.646 --> 00:28:01.176
we're also making
interstitial requests

617
00:27:59.646 --> 00:28:01.176
we're also making
interstitial requests

618
00:28:01.176 --> 00:28:04.216
which we'll be loading
an ad for us.

619
00:28:04.406 --> 00:28:09.136
Note that the default
fill rate for development

620
00:28:09.136 --> 00:28:10.606
of the application is 80%.

621
00:28:10.606 --> 00:28:13.946
You will want to change
that again as Nathan pointed

622
00:28:13.946 --> 00:28:17.596
out if you want to test things
work all the time, versus never,

623
00:28:18.346 --> 00:28:19.856
go ahead and click on one

624
00:28:19.856 --> 00:28:26.626
of the articles here,
and not get an ad.

625
00:28:26.906 --> 00:28:29.616
We got one down there.

626
00:28:29.806 --> 00:28:30.196
There we go.

627
00:28:30.316 --> 00:28:32.556
So the user's tapped on
the article headline.

628
00:28:32.616 --> 00:28:33.696
They've gone in the
article view,

629
00:28:33.696 --> 00:28:37.286
and the full-screen ad has
presented over the article view.

630
00:28:37.846 --> 00:28:40.476
Once the user has finished
engaging with this ad,

631
00:28:40.516 --> 00:28:45.276
they can go ahead and close that
ad, and they're back immediately

632
00:28:45.276 --> 00:28:46.276
into your View Controller.

633
00:28:47.076 --> 00:28:50.086
And with that, I'll bring Nathan
back up to continue the slides.

634
00:28:50.086 --> 00:28:51.416
>> Nathan de Vries: So simply,

635
00:28:51.416 --> 00:28:53.546
setting the Interstitial
Presentation Policy

636
00:28:53.546 --> 00:28:54.696
on your View Controllers,

637
00:28:54.696 --> 00:28:57.146
and you get this
automatic view controller

638
00:28:57.146 --> 00:28:58.486
interstitial presentation.

639
00:28:58.806 --> 00:28:59.566
It's pretty easy.

640
00:28:59.566 --> 00:29:01.316
Pretty easy to get started.

641
00:28:59.566 --> 00:29:01.316
Pretty easy to get started.

642
00:29:01.886 --> 00:29:04.286
So next we're going to look

643
00:29:04.286 --> 00:29:09.416
at this ad type called the IAB
Medium Rectangle Advertisement.

644
00:29:10.346 --> 00:29:12.286
So what is this?

645
00:29:12.286 --> 00:29:16.406
It's a view that's very similar
to a banner view, except instead

646
00:29:16.406 --> 00:29:18.496
of being positioned at the
bottom of your content,

647
00:29:18.496 --> 00:29:20.466
it's positioned in-line
with your content.

648
00:29:21.186 --> 00:29:24.586
The size of this
view is prescribed

649
00:29:24.666 --> 00:29:27.596
by the Interactive
Advertising Viewer,

650
00:29:27.626 --> 00:29:30.726
which is why it's called the
Medium Rectangle Advertisement.

651
00:29:30.726 --> 00:29:32.536
You might have seen
this on websites.

652
00:29:33.086 --> 00:29:36.306
It's 250 points by 300 points.

653
00:29:37.276 --> 00:29:40.336
It also has a similar cycling
behavior as the banner view,

654
00:29:40.336 --> 00:29:44.556
so as new ads become available,
the ad cycle in the view.

655
00:29:45.766 --> 00:29:49.446
And, again, like
the banner content,

656
00:29:49.856 --> 00:29:53.066
you also get full
screen ads on tap.

657
00:29:53.736 --> 00:29:56.636
This was introduced
in iOS 6 [inaudible],

658
00:29:56.636 --> 00:29:59.406
and it's available only on iPad.

659
00:29:59.936 --> 00:30:01.896
So how do we create
one of these things?

660
00:29:59.936 --> 00:30:01.896
So how do we create
one of these things?

661
00:30:02.376 --> 00:30:04.496
As you noticed, it
was positioned in-line

662
00:30:04.846 --> 00:30:07.686
in the content, so you have
this greater flexibility

663
00:30:07.686 --> 00:30:10.706
and positioning of the
view within your content.

664
00:30:10.766 --> 00:30:15.076
So to do that, we need to
create this banner view

665
00:30:15.446 --> 00:30:17.366
of type medium rectangle.

666
00:30:17.796 --> 00:30:20.976
So here you can see after we've
imported the headers like we did

667
00:30:20.976 --> 00:30:23.806
for the banner view, we
created this new banner view

668
00:30:23.806 --> 00:30:25.546
of type medium rectangle.

669
00:30:25.956 --> 00:30:30.526
And this is going to create
nearly unloaded medium

670
00:30:30.526 --> 00:30:31.626
rectangle view.

671
00:30:32.606 --> 00:30:35.316
So we also need to configure
ourselves as the delegate

672
00:30:35.316 --> 00:30:38.146
of this view because
as ads become available

673
00:30:38.326 --> 00:30:43.376
and unavailable inside this
banner view, we need to be told

674
00:30:43.376 --> 00:30:45.916
so we know when to
present the view onscreen

675
00:30:46.006 --> 00:30:46.956
and take it off screen.

676
00:30:47.456 --> 00:30:49.006
So we set ourselves
as the delegate,

677
00:30:49.006 --> 00:30:51.706
and the protocol
that's used to talk

678
00:30:51.706 --> 00:30:54.996
to that delegate is the 80
Banner View Delegate protocol.

679
00:30:55.156 --> 00:30:57.816
So whichever object you've
assigned as the delegate needs

680
00:30:57.816 --> 00:31:00.366
to conform to the 80 Banner
View Delegate protocol.

681
00:30:57.816 --> 00:31:00.366
to conform to the 80 Banner
View Delegate protocol.

682
00:31:00.696 --> 00:31:01.596
So we do that as well.

683
00:31:03.406 --> 00:31:05.356
When the banner is
ready to load,

684
00:31:05.426 --> 00:31:06.886
so we get this Delegate
Callback.

685
00:31:07.426 --> 00:31:10.126
That callback is called the
Banner View Did Load Callback.

686
00:31:10.426 --> 00:31:11.316
Called on the delegate.

687
00:31:12.086 --> 00:31:14.916
And when this happens,
that's an opportunity for you

688
00:31:14.916 --> 00:31:17.286
to present the ad on screen.

689
00:31:17.286 --> 00:31:18.686
We now have an ad
fulfilled by an ad request.

690
00:31:18.686 --> 00:31:21.016
We now have an ad
fulfilled by an ad request.

691
00:31:21.316 --> 00:31:23.096
We now need to turn
that into an impression.

692
00:31:23.906 --> 00:31:27.186
So to do that, you can do your
custom layout however you would

693
00:31:27.186 --> 00:31:29.326
like to present that view.

694
00:31:29.326 --> 00:31:32.926
You could cross-fade it in,
readjust your other views,

695
00:31:33.156 --> 00:31:36.146
and present that medium
rectangle ad in-line

696
00:31:36.146 --> 00:31:36.916
with your content.

697
00:31:39.496 --> 00:31:43.886
Similarly to banner ads, when
the medium rectangle is tapped,

698
00:31:44.136 --> 00:31:45.636
you get the full-screen ad.

699
00:31:46.316 --> 00:31:48.846
You also need to use
the view will disappear

700
00:31:48.846 --> 00:31:52.826
and view will appear callbacks
to pause any activity and sounds

701
00:31:52.826 --> 00:31:57.326
in your application to prevent
them clashing with any sounds

702
00:31:57.326 --> 00:32:01.126
and media that are
being played in the ad.

703
00:31:57.326 --> 00:32:01.126
and media that are
being played in the ad.

704
00:32:01.396 --> 00:32:04.406
When it comes time to unload
that medium rectangle,

705
00:32:04.816 --> 00:32:06.186
the next callback you'll receive

706
00:32:06.186 --> 00:32:09.586
on our Delegate is called the
bannerviewdidFailToReceiveAd

707
00:32:09.586 --> 00:32:10.846
with Error Callback.

708
00:32:11.536 --> 00:32:14.486
And this is an opportunity for
you to remove due to the reverse

709
00:32:14.586 --> 00:32:16.836
of adding the view to the
view hierarchy, and you want

710
00:32:16.836 --> 00:32:18.106
to move it off screen.

711
00:32:18.866 --> 00:32:20.126
It's important to
keep in mind here

712
00:32:20.126 --> 00:32:25.736
that you shouldn't just throw
away the medium rects ad view

713
00:32:26.186 --> 00:32:27.446
because you can just
keep it around.

714
00:32:27.446 --> 00:32:29.546
It'll continue to
cycle with new ads.

715
00:32:29.836 --> 00:32:32.576
So as those new ads
become available,

716
00:32:32.576 --> 00:32:36.636
you can simply add the same
medium rectangle ad view back

717
00:32:36.636 --> 00:32:38.496
to your views hierarchy.

718
00:32:40.176 --> 00:32:44.146
So much like banner
ads, we have some tools

719
00:32:44.146 --> 00:32:46.486
for testing medium rectangles.

720
00:32:46.926 --> 00:32:48.916
We still have the
adjustments to fill rate.

721
00:32:48.916 --> 00:32:50.746
They also work with
these medium recs.

722
00:32:51.126 --> 00:32:52.766
We have adjustments
to refresh rate.

723
00:32:52.986 --> 00:32:54.386
Same as we discussed before.

724
00:32:54.386 --> 00:32:59.216
But there's another additional
toggle that you can flip used

725
00:32:59.216 --> 00:33:02.446
for medium rectangles because
you're positioning them often

726
00:32:59.216 --> 00:33:02.446
for medium rectangles because
you're positioning them often

727
00:33:02.446 --> 00:33:04.666
in very specific ways
in line with content,

728
00:33:05.096 --> 00:33:09.316
and what that switch does is
it helps you avoid any clipping

729
00:33:09.316 --> 00:33:10.416
of that ad view.

730
00:33:10.946 --> 00:33:13.416
So we really want to
avoid clipping the ad view

731
00:33:13.416 --> 00:33:16.256
because that can prevent the
user from being able to see it

732
00:33:16.256 --> 00:33:17.566
or the user being
able to tap it,

733
00:33:17.706 --> 00:33:20.456
so by flipping the
highlight clipped banners,

734
00:33:20.766 --> 00:33:24.336
you get these overlaid
red or green views on top

735
00:33:24.336 --> 00:33:27.126
of your medium rects to show
whether it's being clipped

736
00:33:27.126 --> 00:33:27.406
or not.

737
00:33:27.726 --> 00:33:31.016
So make sure that you
run your application

738
00:33:31.016 --> 00:33:32.996
with this flag enabled
in Settings

739
00:33:33.266 --> 00:33:36.406
to make sure your medium
rects aren't being clipped.

740
00:33:37.236 --> 00:33:39.676
So let's get a demo of that.

741
00:33:40.506 --> 00:33:40.896
>> David Wilson: Okay.

742
00:33:41.296 --> 00:33:44.716
So to enter it medium rectangles

743
00:33:44.716 --> 00:33:49.326
into an application is a
little more complicated,

744
00:33:49.326 --> 00:33:50.246
as Nathan mentioned.

745
00:33:50.636 --> 00:33:52.966
So to do that, we're going to
start with a new application,

746
00:33:52.966 --> 00:33:55.646
and this is sort of a
bit of a game simulation.

747
00:33:56.236 --> 00:33:59.736
Most of the screen is going to
be taken up by the simulation.

748
00:33:59.736 --> 00:34:00.766
There's some text at the bottom

749
00:33:59.736 --> 00:34:00.766
There's some text at the bottom

750
00:34:00.766 --> 00:34:03.756
that has some wasted white
space, and we're going to try

751
00:34:03.756 --> 00:34:05.426
to take advantage of
some of that white space,

752
00:34:05.426 --> 00:34:06.696
to include a medium rect

753
00:34:06.696 --> 00:34:08.456
in the bottom left
corner of our screen.

754
00:34:08.896 --> 00:34:12.025
Okay. So, anyway, you just
have to trust me that we have

755
00:34:12.025 --> 00:34:14.835
as a simulation at the top, and
we have some text at the bottom,

756
00:34:14.835 --> 00:34:18.045
and we've got a medium rectangle
that we're going to want to put

757
00:34:18.045 --> 00:34:19.846
on the bottom left
corner of the screen.

758
00:34:20.456 --> 00:34:23.896
So to do that, as we did
in our previous project,

759
00:34:23.896 --> 00:34:25.606
the first thing we're
going to need to do is link

760
00:34:25.606 --> 00:34:27.406
against the iAd framework.

761
00:34:27.696 --> 00:34:31.315
So click on our project
here, go over to Build Phases

762
00:34:31.315 --> 00:34:33.166
for the appropriate target.

763
00:34:33.166 --> 00:34:35.846
Link binary with Libraries.

764
00:34:35.846 --> 00:34:39.656
And we're going to link
in the iAd framework.

765
00:34:40.136 --> 00:34:42.926
Remember this is an
iPad only feature,

766
00:34:42.926 --> 00:34:46.606
so we can't actually demo
it with the iOS 7 STK today.

767
00:34:46.846 --> 00:34:51.356
But you can build applications
to run against iOS 6.1,

768
00:34:51.356 --> 00:34:54.396
and they will work with
the next seed for iOS 7.

769
00:34:55.146 --> 00:34:57.126
Once we've linked
against the iAd framework,

770
00:34:57.556 --> 00:35:00.526
the next thing we need to do
is go to our View Controller.

771
00:34:57.556 --> 00:35:00.526
the next thing we need to do
is go to our View Controller.

772
00:35:01.446 --> 00:35:03.616
We're going to go ahead and
Import the iAd framework here

773
00:35:03.616 --> 00:35:05.676
to give us access
to these API's.

774
00:35:06.496 --> 00:35:08.506
And because we need
to have a delegate

775
00:35:08.506 --> 00:35:10.676
for the medium rect banner view,

776
00:35:10.676 --> 00:35:12.596
we're going to make
our View Controller

777
00:35:12.706 --> 00:35:16.326
that 80 Banner View Delegate,
and then we're going to set

778
00:35:16.326 --> 00:35:21.266
up a couple properties to hold
the new 80 Banner View Medium

779
00:35:21.266 --> 00:35:24.216
Rect that we're going to create,
and to keep track of whether

780
00:35:24.216 --> 00:35:26.396
or not the ad is
currently visible on screen.

781
00:35:26.756 --> 00:35:29.046
We're going to need this so that
we can do the appropriate layout

782
00:35:29.046 --> 00:35:31.656
as the banner view
loads and unloads.

783
00:35:32.466 --> 00:35:35.926
So once we have those
properties inside Load View,

784
00:35:35.926 --> 00:35:39.156
we can go ahead and
instantiate that.

785
00:35:39.666 --> 00:35:41.946
Note that all we have to
do is alloc initWithAd:

786
00:35:42.076 --> 00:35:45.146
ADAdTypeMediumRectangle,
and then remember

787
00:35:45.146 --> 00:35:48.216
to set the delegate to
the View Controller.

788
00:35:49.056 --> 00:35:50.776
Once we've done that, we need

789
00:35:50.776 --> 00:35:53.526
to update our
viewDidLayoutSubviews method

790
00:35:53.526 --> 00:35:56.486
so that we can include the
medium rect inside our layout.

791
00:35:57.316 --> 00:36:01.526
So all we need to do here is
do some frame calculations

792
00:35:57.316 --> 00:36:01.526
So all we need to do here is
do some frame calculations

793
00:36:01.526 --> 00:36:03.136
for the medium rect,
which puts it,

794
00:36:03.936 --> 00:36:06.446
with the calculations
here we're doing is layout

795
00:36:06.446 --> 00:36:09.016
out the medium rect in the
bottom left of the screen

796
00:36:09.016 --> 00:36:11.226
if it's loaded, and
just off-screen

797
00:36:11.226 --> 00:36:13.066
in the bottom left,
if it's not loaded.

798
00:36:13.416 --> 00:36:16.636
That allows us to do smooth
animated transitions on

799
00:36:16.636 --> 00:36:19.046
and off screen, as
the loaded property

800
00:36:19.046 --> 00:36:20.416
of this banner view changes.

801
00:36:20.856 --> 00:36:23.676
To do that, we're also going
to need to adjust the origin

802
00:36:23.676 --> 00:36:25.066
of the frame that's next to it.

803
00:36:25.206 --> 00:36:27.816
Once we've done that,
then we need

804
00:36:27.816 --> 00:36:30.656
to actually start implementing
the delegate method callbacks

805
00:36:30.656 --> 00:36:33.236
that will tell us when things
happen with this banner view.

806
00:36:33.976 --> 00:36:37.066
So the first thing we're going
to do is go down to the bottom

807
00:36:37.616 --> 00:36:40.516
and hide the rest of this.

808
00:36:40.686 --> 00:36:43.366
Then we go to first start

809
00:36:43.366 --> 00:36:46.186
out by implementing
bannerViewDidLoadAd.

810
00:36:46.286 --> 00:36:50.296
This is our cue to move
the banner onscreen

811
00:36:50.406 --> 00:36:51.736
if it's not already there.

812
00:36:52.256 --> 00:36:55.396
This is iAd telling us that
there's a new ad that's in place

813
00:36:55.396 --> 00:36:57.196
in the view and we should
display it to the user.

814
00:36:58.016 --> 00:36:59.376
If it's already visible,
that's fine.

815
00:36:59.376 --> 00:37:01.226
We don't need to
take any action.

816
00:36:59.376 --> 00:37:01.226
We don't need to
take any action.

817
00:37:01.226 --> 00:37:03.636
If it's not, we're going
to set our property here

818
00:37:03.636 --> 00:37:06.316
and then we're just going
to do a quick animation

819
00:37:06.316 --> 00:37:09.556
to move this thing onscreen by
just calling setNeedsLayout,

820
00:37:09.816 --> 00:37:12.286
layoutIfNeeded, and letting
the layout code that we did

821
00:37:12.286 --> 00:37:14.096
up above handle this for us.

822
00:37:15.176 --> 00:37:17.316
Now once the banner's been
onscreen for a little while,

823
00:37:17.316 --> 00:37:20.336
we're going to have to move it
back off screen if it unloads,

824
00:37:20.936 --> 00:37:23.296
say the user moves out
of network connectivity,

825
00:37:23.296 --> 00:37:25.176
or we just run out of inventory.

826
00:37:25.266 --> 00:37:26.746
So we're going to implement

827
00:37:26.746 --> 00:37:29.276
in this case the
bannerViewDidFailToLoadAd

828
00:37:29.276 --> 00:37:30.776
with error method.

829
00:37:30.776 --> 00:37:34.276
This is almost identical
to moving it onscreen,

830
00:37:34.276 --> 00:37:36.346
except we're going to
change our property to No,

831
00:37:37.016 --> 00:37:39.626
and then we're going to
again do an animation based

832
00:37:39.626 --> 00:37:41.786
on setNeedsLayout,
layoutIfNeeded.

833
00:37:42.196 --> 00:37:44.506
So that'll move the
thing on and off screen,

834
00:37:44.506 --> 00:37:46.306
but there's one more thing
we need to take care of,

835
00:37:46.306 --> 00:37:47.986
and that's pausing our game

836
00:37:47.986 --> 00:37:49.886
when the user actually
interacts with this ad.

837
00:37:50.196 --> 00:37:51.506
We've got a simulation running.

838
00:37:51.506 --> 00:37:52.776
It's taking up CPU.

839
00:37:53.046 --> 00:37:54.876
Maybe the user is actually
interested in watching

840
00:37:54.876 --> 00:37:57.236
that simulation, and we
don't want to let it just go

841
00:37:57.236 --> 00:38:00.606
on behind the scenes while the
user's interacting with the ad.

842
00:37:57.236 --> 00:38:00.606
on behind the scenes while the
user's interacting with the ad.

843
00:38:01.226 --> 00:38:02.636
So to do that, we're
going to go ahead

844
00:38:02.636 --> 00:38:05.496
and implement view did
appear, view did disappear

845
00:38:05.496 --> 00:38:08.466
on our view controller, and
all we need to do here is start

846
00:38:08.466 --> 00:38:11.066
and stop timers that are
running our simulation.

847
00:38:11.066 --> 00:38:14.136
If you had media, this would
also be your cure to pause

848
00:38:14.136 --> 00:38:15.506
and then resume the media.

849
00:38:16.196 --> 00:38:17.356
Once we've done that,

850
00:38:17.806 --> 00:38:19.856
if our demo machine were
working we could run it again,

851
00:38:20.076 --> 00:38:22.636
but that's pretty much
all you need to do

852
00:38:22.636 --> 00:38:25.056
to get medium rects
integrated into your app.

853
00:38:25.656 --> 00:38:27.126
And with that I'll
bring Nathan back out.

854
00:38:27.306 --> 00:38:29.626
>> Nathan de Vries: So the next
ad type which we're excited

855
00:38:29.626 --> 00:38:32.576
to talk about today, is
the pre-roll video ad.

856
00:38:32.856 --> 00:38:36.006
We've had a lot of requests for
this, and it's new to iOS 7,

857
00:38:36.506 --> 00:38:39.586
and what this lets you do
is integrate seamlessly

858
00:38:39.586 --> 00:38:41.276
with the media player API's

859
00:38:41.506 --> 00:38:45.616
to request playback all the
video before your video content.

860
00:38:46.376 --> 00:38:48.586
So as I said, it's
brand new in iOS 7.

861
00:38:49.136 --> 00:38:52.036
It's integrated with
the media player API's.

862
00:38:52.036 --> 00:38:54.486
So the way you would
normally play back media

863
00:38:54.486 --> 00:38:56.476
with the MP movie
player controller API,

864
00:38:57.076 --> 00:38:59.286
you can now just
use a different API

865
00:38:59.406 --> 00:39:03.576
to play a pre-roll
ad before that media.

866
00:38:59.406 --> 00:39:03.576
to play a pre-roll
ad before that media.

867
00:39:03.786 --> 00:39:05.426
When the pre-roll
starts playing,

868
00:39:05.716 --> 00:39:08.846
this happens before the
media content starts playing,

869
00:39:08.926 --> 00:39:11.826
your primary media
content starts playing,

870
00:39:12.216 --> 00:39:13.916
and when the advertisement
finishes,

871
00:39:14.216 --> 00:39:17.406
you get this seamless transition
to the main content video.

872
00:39:18.056 --> 00:39:21.736
If the user engages with the
video while it's displayed

873
00:39:21.736 --> 00:39:22.846
with this pre-roll video,

874
00:39:23.196 --> 00:39:26.356
they get that standard
full-screen immersive ad

875
00:39:26.356 --> 00:39:27.546
experience as well.

876
00:39:27.546 --> 00:39:29.816
Just like all of the other
advertisements we support.

877
00:39:30.856 --> 00:39:33.186
We also support Inline playback.

878
00:39:33.376 --> 00:39:34.656
So if you've got an application

879
00:39:34.656 --> 00:39:37.716
that doesn't assume
full-screen media playback,

880
00:39:38.036 --> 00:39:40.776
then you can also use
pre-roll video in that scenario

881
00:39:40.776 --> 00:39:43.556
by using the embedded style
for MP movie player controller,

882
00:39:43.556 --> 00:39:47.676
and this is supported
on both iPhone and iPad.

883
00:39:48.156 --> 00:39:50.806
So let's take a look
at how to create one

884
00:39:50.806 --> 00:39:52.626
of these MP movie
player controllers.

885
00:39:53.506 --> 00:39:56.436
In addition to the usual iAd
framework import that you need

886
00:39:56.436 --> 00:39:57.826
to do for the other ad types,

887
00:39:58.236 --> 00:40:00.516
the MP movie player
controller functionality is

888
00:39:58.236 --> 00:40:00.516
the MP movie player
controller functionality is

889
00:40:00.516 --> 00:40:03.006
in the media player framework.

890
00:40:03.276 --> 00:40:04.756
So you'll need to
link media player

891
00:40:05.216 --> 00:40:07.576
and also import the
media player headers.

892
00:40:09.086 --> 00:40:11.906
We then need to create a new
MP movie player controller,

893
00:40:12.116 --> 00:40:14.106
or an MP movie player
view controller,

894
00:40:14.196 --> 00:40:17.516
depending on your application,
and set the content URL

895
00:40:17.706 --> 00:40:19.176
of that movie player controller.

896
00:40:19.526 --> 00:40:21.416
This is the usual video content

897
00:40:21.416 --> 00:40:23.296
that you would have been
playing before you started

898
00:40:23.296 --> 00:40:24.576
integrating iAd.

899
00:40:24.756 --> 00:40:28.046
After we've done that, instead
of calling the play method

900
00:40:28.046 --> 00:40:29.506
on the movie player controller,

901
00:40:29.756 --> 00:40:33.456
iAd has this new category
method called playPrerollAdWith

902
00:40:33.456 --> 00:40:35.406
CompletionHandler,
which allows you

903
00:40:35.406 --> 00:40:37.916
to provide a completion
block that gets called

904
00:40:38.136 --> 00:40:41.726
after the ad finishes, or if
there was no other ad available

905
00:40:41.726 --> 00:40:44.606
at the time of requesting
a pre-roll ad.

906
00:40:44.786 --> 00:40:47.646
Once you've called this API,
you can immediately add,

907
00:40:48.126 --> 00:40:52.676
so inside that handler, once
the playback has finished,

908
00:40:52.856 --> 00:40:54.916
or if there wasn't a
pre-roll available,

909
00:40:55.366 --> 00:40:57.896
that's your opportunity
to call the play API

910
00:40:57.896 --> 00:41:01.826
and play your original
video content.

911
00:40:57.896 --> 00:41:01.826
and play your original
video content.

912
00:41:03.426 --> 00:41:04.936
Once you've called
this Play Pre-Roll Ad

913
00:41:04.936 --> 00:41:06.236
with Completion Handler API,

914
00:41:06.786 --> 00:41:09.066
you can then add the movie
player controllers view

915
00:41:09.096 --> 00:41:10.266
to your view hierarchy,

916
00:41:10.566 --> 00:41:13.166
or you can present the
movie player view controller

917
00:41:13.376 --> 00:41:14.466
in your application.

918
00:41:15.076 --> 00:41:19.226
If you've got an app that has
a scenario where you would

919
00:41:19.226 --> 00:41:22.136
like to conditionally play
pre-roll for some users

920
00:41:22.166 --> 00:41:25.426
and not others, or maybe you've
got some time based logic as to

921
00:41:25.426 --> 00:41:28.806
when you want to show pre-roll
ads, you can do that too.

922
00:41:29.316 --> 00:41:32.706
All you need to do is
call the play API instead

923
00:41:32.706 --> 00:41:36.236
of calling the Play Pre-Roll
Ad with Completion Handler API.

924
00:41:36.236 --> 00:41:38.966
And you can come up with your
own logic for when you do

925
00:41:38.966 --> 00:41:40.726
and you don't, display
pre-roll ads,

926
00:41:40.776 --> 00:41:44.566
and which situations are
optimal for your app.

927
00:41:46.056 --> 00:41:49.136
Much like interstitial ads,
you also need to prepare early.

928
00:41:49.206 --> 00:41:50.696
You need to tell
the ad framework

929
00:41:50.696 --> 00:41:53.006
that it should start
sending requests as soon

930
00:41:53.006 --> 00:41:55.586
as the application launches,
so that the first time

931
00:41:55.586 --> 00:41:57.086
that a user taps on a video,

932
00:41:57.416 --> 00:42:00.046
a pre-roll ad is more
likely to be available.

933
00:41:57.416 --> 00:42:00.046
a pre-roll ad is more
likely to be available.

934
00:42:00.546 --> 00:42:02.856
It's all about not missing
those early impressions.

935
00:42:03.396 --> 00:42:05.806
So similarly to the
UI view controller,

936
00:42:05.806 --> 00:42:07.446
preparing [inaudible]
ads called,

937
00:42:08.076 --> 00:42:13.376
we now swap that with an MP
movie player controller prepare

938
00:42:13.376 --> 00:42:14.626
pre-roll ads [inaudible].

939
00:42:14.716 --> 00:42:16.676
And this will do the
same effective thing.

940
00:42:16.676 --> 00:42:18.356
It's sending off
ad requests as soon

941
00:42:18.356 --> 00:42:20.706
as your application
becomes available.

942
00:42:21.326 --> 00:42:25.626
So there are a couple of gotchas

943
00:42:25.626 --> 00:42:28.166
with the movie player
controller API.

944
00:42:28.916 --> 00:42:32.046
Those of you that are already
using MP movie player controller

945
00:42:32.046 --> 00:42:34.456
will need to keep in
mind that you may need

946
00:42:34.456 --> 00:42:37.546
to adjust your application
to accommodate pre-roll ads.

947
00:42:38.516 --> 00:42:40.826
The first thing that you
need to make sure of is

948
00:42:40.826 --> 00:42:45.026
that if you're ever explicitly
playing your MP movie player

949
00:42:45.426 --> 00:42:48.166
controller, you need to make
sure that that doesn't happen

950
00:42:48.166 --> 00:42:50.046
until the completion
handler is pulled.

951
00:42:50.536 --> 00:42:54.106
This is because it's the main
content starts playing while the

952
00:42:54.106 --> 00:42:54.936
pre-roll is playing,

953
00:42:55.196 --> 00:42:57.406
we'll immediately skip
to the main content.

954
00:42:57.996 --> 00:42:59.376
So bear that in mind.

955
00:42:59.906 --> 00:43:02.686
There's two slightly indirect
times that this can happen.

956
00:42:59.906 --> 00:43:02.686
There's two slightly indirect
times that this can happen.

957
00:43:03.056 --> 00:43:06.756
Many people will observe
these two notifications

958
00:43:06.756 --> 00:43:10.096
on MP movie player controller,
when the video becomes available

959
00:43:10.096 --> 00:43:12.496
for playback, and also
when the first frame

960
00:43:12.496 --> 00:43:14.406
of the video is available
for display.

961
00:43:15.066 --> 00:43:18.146
A lot of developers use
these and rightly so,

962
00:43:18.146 --> 00:43:20.446
for playing back the media
content, but you need

963
00:43:20.446 --> 00:43:23.006
to be aware that if you
call play in response

964
00:43:23.006 --> 00:43:26.656
to these notifications, you
may skip the pre-roll adds,

965
00:43:26.656 --> 00:43:28.826
so make sure that you don't
handle these notifications

966
00:43:28.826 --> 00:43:33.646
until after the callback
handler is called, and likewise

967
00:43:33.646 --> 00:43:35.196
if your customizing the UI

968
00:43:35.196 --> 00:43:37.746
of the MP movie player
controller, which is supported.

969
00:43:37.746 --> 00:43:42.396
You also need to hold off on
inserting any custom views

970
00:43:42.396 --> 00:43:45.196
into the view controller's
view until after

971
00:43:45.196 --> 00:43:46.676
that completion handler
is called

972
00:43:46.736 --> 00:43:50.186
because you don't want your
views colliding with any

973
00:43:50.186 --> 00:43:51.216
of the pre-roll content.

974
00:43:53.226 --> 00:43:55.566
And let's bring David
up for a demo of that.

975
00:43:55.856 --> 00:43:57.686
>>David: To start off with
to demonstrate pre-roll adds,

976
00:43:57.686 --> 00:44:01.456
we're going to start with this
very simple collection view

977
00:43:57.686 --> 00:44:01.456
we're going to start with this
very simple collection view

978
00:44:01.456 --> 00:44:02.746
application on the phone.

979
00:44:02.746 --> 00:44:05.466
Just has one view controller
that's a collection of views,

980
00:44:05.466 --> 00:44:09.346
and hold a set of thumbnails for
videos, and the user can tap one

981
00:44:09.346 --> 00:44:11.766
of those thumbnails
to go into the video.

982
00:44:12.016 --> 00:44:12.436
That's great.

983
00:44:12.436 --> 00:44:14.206
We can go ahead and see
what that looks like.

984
00:44:14.786 --> 00:44:17.506
We have a few short videos here.

985
00:44:17.506 --> 00:44:21.146
We can tap one of them,
and the video plays.

986
00:44:21.146 --> 00:44:22.636
What we want to do is instead

987
00:44:22.636 --> 00:44:24.166
of just having the
video play immediately,

988
00:44:24.166 --> 00:44:26.626
we want to put a pre-roll
in front of that video

989
00:44:26.816 --> 00:44:28.396
so we can monetize
our application.

990
00:44:28.576 --> 00:44:31.136
So let's take a look
at what that takes.

991
00:44:31.166 --> 00:44:34.526
So we're going to
pull up Xcode again.

992
00:44:34.526 --> 00:44:36.926
The first thing we need to do,

993
00:44:37.326 --> 00:44:39.566
as we did in the previous
two demos, is to go ahead

994
00:44:39.566 --> 00:44:41.576
and make sure we link
against the iAd framework.

995
00:44:41.756 --> 00:44:43.896
We'll go ahead and
click on our project,

996
00:44:44.046 --> 00:44:47.246
make sure the right target
is selected, build phases,

997
00:44:47.696 --> 00:44:50.676
and link against
the iAd framework.

998
00:44:52.076 --> 00:44:55.246
Once we've done that, just
as with the interstitials,

999
00:44:55.246 --> 00:44:58.906
it's important to tell iAd early
in the application's lifecycle

1000
00:44:58.906 --> 00:45:00.486
that you want pre-roll ads.

1001
00:44:58.906 --> 00:45:00.486
that you want pre-roll ads.

1002
00:45:00.546 --> 00:45:03.596
This allows it to go ahead
and make requests early,

1003
00:45:03.806 --> 00:45:05.606
so that a pre-roll is available

1004
00:45:05.696 --> 00:45:08.276
when the user takes an
action that should show one.

1005
00:45:08.886 --> 00:45:10.536
So to do that, we're
going to again go

1006
00:45:10.536 --> 00:45:15.176
to our app delegate application
didFinishLaunchingWithOptions.

1007
00:45:15.176 --> 00:45:18.326
We're going to go ahead
and import the iAd header

1008
00:45:18.726 --> 00:45:19.986
and the media player header.

1009
00:45:20.466 --> 00:45:24.886
This gives us access to both the
MP movie player controller class

1010
00:45:24.886 --> 00:45:29.276
and the prepared pre-roll ads
category that iAd adds to that.

1011
00:45:29.276 --> 00:45:32.136
So inside
didFinishLaunchingWithOptions,

1012
00:45:32.136 --> 00:45:37.026
we're just going to call MP
movie player controller prepare

1013
00:45:37.026 --> 00:45:39.376
pre-roll adds, and that
kicks off the ad requests

1014
00:45:39.406 --> 00:45:41.686
so that we can have a pre-roll
ready when the user taps

1015
00:45:41.686 --> 00:45:42.806
on one of our thumbnails.

1016
00:45:43.516 --> 00:45:47.656
Speaking of that, we next need
to take care of actually doing

1017
00:45:47.656 --> 00:45:49.676
that when the user taps
on one of the thumbnails.

1018
00:45:49.716 --> 00:45:52.686
So to do that, we're going
to go to our view controller.

1019
00:45:52.686 --> 00:45:54.996
We're going to go back up to
the top first, and we're going

1020
00:45:54.996 --> 00:45:58.216
to import the iAd
header here as well.

1021
00:45:58.216 --> 00:46:00.436
We've already imported
the media player framework

1022
00:45:58.216 --> 00:46:00.436
We've already imported
the media player framework

1023
00:46:00.436 --> 00:46:02.026
since we're playing the videos.

1024
00:46:02.586 --> 00:46:04.256
And then we're going to go down
to the bottom and we're going

1025
00:46:04.256 --> 00:46:04.476
to go

1026
00:46:04.476 --> 00:46:07.676
to our collectionViewdidSelect
ItemAtIndexPath.

1027
00:46:07.746 --> 00:46:12.476
This is where we handled that
tap and begin playing the movie.

1028
00:46:13.086 --> 00:46:16.476
All we're doing at the moment is
instantiating an MP movie player

1029
00:46:16.476 --> 00:46:18.926
view controller and
setting the content URL,

1030
00:46:19.306 --> 00:46:20.326
and then presenting it.

1031
00:46:21.006 --> 00:46:24.806
The only change we need to
make here is to insert a call

1032
00:46:24.806 --> 00:46:27.556
to play pre-roll ad
with completion handler.

1033
00:46:28.166 --> 00:46:31.896
A note that we're calling MPV
controller movie player play

1034
00:46:32.256 --> 00:46:33.826
inside the completion handler.

1035
00:46:33.826 --> 00:46:37.206
So once the pre-roll has
finished or has failed to play,

1036
00:46:38.166 --> 00:46:39.436
we'll go ahead and
play our content.

1037
00:46:40.376 --> 00:46:44.666
Once we've done that, we can
go ahead and run this again.

1038
00:46:48.196 --> 00:46:50.436
We've launched application.

1039
00:46:50.436 --> 00:46:52.006
You see we've changed
almost nothing here.

1040
00:46:52.006 --> 00:46:54.276
We still got our
collection of videos.

1041
00:46:54.436 --> 00:46:57.696
And this time when the user
taps on one of these videos,

1042
00:46:57.726 --> 00:47:00.706
if an ad is available, a
pre-roll should play before it.

1043
00:46:57.726 --> 00:47:00.706
if an ad is available, a
pre-roll should play before it.

1044
00:47:01.936 --> 00:47:02.656
And here we go.

1045
00:47:02.656 --> 00:47:06.056
We've got these are tapped,
we've got the ad coming up,

1046
00:47:06.146 --> 00:47:10.346
the ad is playing, a few seconds
later, the user will be able

1047
00:47:10.346 --> 00:47:13.766
to either watch this ad to
completion or skip through.

1048
00:47:14.356 --> 00:47:15.416
And when that finishes,

1049
00:47:15.846 --> 00:47:17.306
the video immediately
begins playing.

1050
00:47:18.816 --> 00:47:21.216
And that's all it takes
to integrate pre-rolls

1051
00:47:21.216 --> 00:47:22.106
into your application.

1052
00:47:22.296 --> 00:47:24.366
With that, I'll bring
Nathan back up.

1053
00:47:24.366 --> 00:47:25.536
>> Nathan de Vries:
So as you can see,

1054
00:47:25.536 --> 00:47:28.046
if you've already got a
movie player application,

1055
00:47:28.046 --> 00:47:31.446
it's very easy to port it
across the playing pre-roll ads.

1056
00:47:32.006 --> 00:47:33.326
If you don't, then
it's very easy

1057
00:47:33.326 --> 00:47:35.146
to add these experiences
to your app.

1058
00:47:35.536 --> 00:47:36.976
So wrapping up a little bit,

1059
00:47:38.416 --> 00:47:41.446
we have these brand new
pre-roll ads available in iOS 7.

1060
00:47:41.576 --> 00:47:44.346
Some great new opportunities
for video apps

1061
00:47:44.346 --> 00:47:46.526
to produce more revenue

1062
00:47:46.576 --> 00:47:48.476
from their application
with pre-roll ads.

1063
00:47:49.266 --> 00:47:51.656
We have those medium rectangle
ads that are supported

1064
00:47:51.656 --> 00:47:54.656
on the iPad that can
be positioned in-line

1065
00:47:54.656 --> 00:47:57.636
with your content for a
more integrated experience.

1066
00:47:58.516 --> 00:48:01.446
We have new interstitial
support for iPhone,

1067
00:47:58.516 --> 00:48:01.446
We have new interstitial
support for iPhone,

1068
00:48:01.776 --> 00:48:03.966
which is new in iOS 7.

1069
00:48:04.176 --> 00:48:07.386
They're also supported on iPad.

1070
00:48:07.386 --> 00:48:11.976
And lastly we have these new
banner controller API's similar

1071
00:48:11.976 --> 00:48:14.016
to the interstitial
API's that allow you

1072
00:48:14.016 --> 00:48:17.506
to simply toggle a switch on
your view controllers to opt

1073
00:48:17.506 --> 00:48:20.256
in to advertising for
those content views.

1074
00:48:21.236 --> 00:48:22.916
And lastly, we spoke
a little bit

1075
00:48:22.916 --> 00:48:26.656
about optimizing your ad
performance, so when you go away

1076
00:48:26.656 --> 00:48:30.476
and you're thinking about
integrating these advertisements

1077
00:48:30.476 --> 00:48:33.426
into your application,
think back to these tips

1078
00:48:33.426 --> 00:48:36.516
for optimizing ad performance,
placing ads smartly,

1079
00:48:36.936 --> 00:48:39.336
looking at specific
regions and locales

1080
00:48:39.336 --> 00:48:42.546
for the way you might want
to optimize your marketing,

1081
00:48:42.976 --> 00:48:46.106
and lastly, make sure that
it all starts with the app.

1082
00:48:46.486 --> 00:48:48.676
Really focus on pleasing
your customers

1083
00:48:48.926 --> 00:48:51.656
and you'll generate far more
revenue from your applications.

1084
00:48:52.096 --> 00:48:52.466
Thank you.

1085
00:48:53.666 --> 00:48:58.006
