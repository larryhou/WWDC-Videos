00:00:00.506 --> 00:00:09.976
[ Silence ]

2
00:00:10.476 --> 00:00:12.556
>> Good afternoon, and welcome.

3
00:00:13.626 --> 00:00:14.136
Thank you.

4
00:00:14.456 --> 00:00:15.696
How's everybody doing?

5
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:19.356
It's been a fun week,
excellent, good.

6
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:20.776
I'm Gordie Freedman.

7
00:00:20.946 --> 00:00:25.746
I work on UIKit, and
today we're going to talk

8
00:00:25.746 --> 00:00:28.516
about State restoration on iOS.

9
00:00:29.486 --> 00:00:31.306
So has this happened to you?

10
00:00:31.736 --> 00:00:35.536
You're using an application,
you go to do something else,

11
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:39.536
and when you go back, the
application's lost your place.

12
00:00:40.476 --> 00:00:44.056
Maybe you were typing something,
maybe you were reading something

13
00:00:44.056 --> 00:00:47.356
and scrolled somewhere, but
the application went back

14
00:00:47.356 --> 00:00:48.046
to the beginning.

15
00:00:48.576 --> 00:00:51.086
In fact, maybe you don't really
remember what you were doing.

16
00:00:51.276 --> 00:00:53.696
You were hoping the
application would remember.

17
00:00:54.296 --> 00:00:57.616
And as developers, we
don't want this to happen

18
00:00:57.616 --> 00:00:59.236
to the users of our apps.

19
00:00:59.746 --> 00:01:01.016
It can be very frustrating.

20
00:00:59.746 --> 00:01:01.016
It can be very frustrating.

21
00:01:01.626 --> 00:01:05.566
But the good news is we've
got some really nice APIs

22
00:01:05.726 --> 00:01:08.886
that make it very easy to
provide a seamless experience

23
00:01:09.116 --> 00:01:10.576
when applications start back up.

24
00:01:11.096 --> 00:01:15.036
I'm going to talk about
four things today.

25
00:01:16.036 --> 00:01:19.916
First I'm going to go over a
small recap of the feature.

26
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:22.056
It's not a full review.

27
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:26.626
We did a session last year in
2012, and if you want to fill

28
00:01:26.626 --> 00:01:29.436
in some of the gaps,
you can go watch that.

29
00:01:29.436 --> 00:01:31.566
We also have some
documentation online,

30
00:01:31.936 --> 00:01:33.076
and you can check that out.

31
00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:36.446
But I think even if you're not
that familiar, you'll be able

32
00:01:36.446 --> 00:01:38.036
to follow along just fine.

33
00:01:39.056 --> 00:01:43.206
I'm going to focus a lot
on what's new in iOS 7.

34
00:01:43.396 --> 00:01:46.076
We'll see what we've
added and how that plays.

35
00:01:46.616 --> 00:01:51.106
We're going to talk a
little bit about security

36
00:01:51.326 --> 00:01:54.246
and background operation --
couple of interesting topics

37
00:01:54.246 --> 00:01:55.506
that I think we might want

38
00:01:55.506 --> 00:01:57.106
to spend a little
time thinking about.

39
00:01:57.756 --> 00:02:01.276
And then finally, I'm going
to go over some of the tools

40
00:01:57.756 --> 00:02:01.276
And then finally, I'm going
to go over some of the tools

41
00:02:01.276 --> 00:02:06.216
that we have that can help you
to be able to both validate

42
00:02:06.216 --> 00:02:08.735
that you're doing -- or your
app is doing what you expect,

43
00:02:09.485 --> 00:02:10.966
and help diagnose problems.

44
00:02:11.526 --> 00:02:15.426
So when we talk about
state restoration,

45
00:02:15.906 --> 00:02:16.996
it's a simple idea --

46
00:02:17.776 --> 00:02:21.696
one application to just go
back exactly where it was

47
00:02:21.966 --> 00:02:24.286
so the user's experience
is not interrupted,

48
00:02:24.856 --> 00:02:26.926
as if the application
had just been

49
00:02:26.926 --> 00:02:28.356
in the background all the time.

50
00:02:28.946 --> 00:02:33.086
And if the application exits and
restarts, the user won't know.

51
00:02:33.756 --> 00:02:37.346
And it really is predicated
on how the user views this,

52
00:02:37.346 --> 00:02:39.726
and we want to think a lot
about what the user's doing.

53
00:02:40.776 --> 00:02:42.456
You want to look at
the different parts

54
00:02:42.456 --> 00:02:46.356
of your application and
examine what you need to save

55
00:02:46.356 --> 00:02:47.596
and what you need to restore.

56
00:02:47.906 --> 00:02:50.476
And that's great, but
start at the top down.

57
00:02:50.806 --> 00:02:54.196
Think about it as if you're
using the application and think,

58
00:02:54.196 --> 00:02:57.186
"If I was using this and it
went away, where do I want it

59
00:02:57.186 --> 00:02:59.406
to come back," and
then from there,

60
00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:01.756
let that inform what
you save and restore.

61
00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:01.756
let that inform what
you save and restore.

62
00:03:02.306 --> 00:03:06.706
I'm going to give a
short demo just to kind

63
00:03:06.706 --> 00:03:08.096
of highlight what
I'm talking about.

64
00:03:08.206 --> 00:03:13.456
So I've got a very
simple application,

65
00:03:13.656 --> 00:03:15.676
got a collection
view, you can see,

66
00:03:15.826 --> 00:03:17.916
do the nice collection
view layout stuff.

67
00:03:17.916 --> 00:03:20.496
And I'm going to
scroll around and look

68
00:03:20.496 --> 00:03:22.796
for an image that I want to see.

69
00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:26.086
So these are all thumbnails
with little titles --

70
00:03:26.276 --> 00:03:27.356
pretty standard stuff.

71
00:03:27.496 --> 00:03:29.436
I'm going to select one --

72
00:03:29.536 --> 00:03:31.276
you can see that I've got
the selection there --

73
00:03:31.276 --> 00:03:32.376
let it roll in.

74
00:03:33.376 --> 00:03:36.336
Let's make it a little
bigger so it's easier to see.

75
00:03:37.096 --> 00:03:41.716
Maybe I'll even get rid of these
bars here and make it like that.

76
00:03:42.376 --> 00:03:44.986
So as a user you might
find an interesting picture

77
00:03:45.086 --> 00:03:47.066
and then you want to
go show it to somebody,

78
00:03:47.546 --> 00:03:50.556
or the phone rings,
or something happens.

79
00:03:50.756 --> 00:03:53.186
The application goes
into the background.

80
00:03:53.696 --> 00:03:58.316
And the application can exit
if left alone for awhile

81
00:03:58.316 --> 00:04:01.216
for various reasons, so I'm
going to force that here.

82
00:03:58.316 --> 00:04:01.216
for various reasons, so I'm
going to force that here.

83
00:04:02.116 --> 00:04:04.056
Now, I just want to
point out one thing.

84
00:04:05.066 --> 00:04:08.906
Ordinarily when a user goes into
the switcher and flips an app

85
00:04:08.906 --> 00:04:11.356
up like I just did,
it'll get rid

86
00:04:11.356 --> 00:04:13.296
of all the state
restoration information.

87
00:04:14.076 --> 00:04:16.976
We do that on purpose
to kind of save a user

88
00:04:16.976 --> 00:04:18.486
if every time they run the app,

89
00:04:18.486 --> 00:04:21.146
it starts up in a bad
state and they're stuck.

90
00:04:21.736 --> 00:04:23.796
First thing a frustrated
user might do is go

91
00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:25.166
in and flick that up.

92
00:04:25.496 --> 00:04:26.416
We'll get rid of the state,

93
00:04:26.416 --> 00:04:28.296
give them a clean
start if that happens.

94
00:04:28.416 --> 00:04:31.036
Hopefully it won't,
but it's an out.

95
00:04:31.806 --> 00:04:35.776
But for developers, sometimes
you don't want that to happen.

96
00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:37.706
If you're trying to chase
a bug, you're trying

97
00:04:37.706 --> 00:04:40.026
to diagnose something
or just simply testing,

98
00:04:40.026 --> 00:04:43.046
it's very convenient to go in,
kill the app and restart it.

99
00:04:43.406 --> 00:04:44.596
You don't want to lose the info.

100
00:04:44.906 --> 00:04:47.416
And I'll talk about that a
little more later, but I'm using

101
00:04:47.416 --> 00:04:50.426
that trick here just to make
the demo a little easier.

102
00:04:51.086 --> 00:04:54.276
So the app's not running
now, and if the user walked

103
00:04:54.276 --> 00:04:55.466
up to their friend
and said, "Hey,

104
00:04:55.466 --> 00:04:58.386
look at this cool picture,"
well, let's see what happens

105
00:04:58.386 --> 00:04:59.776
if we start it back up.

106
00:05:00.916 --> 00:05:02.736
And it goes right
back to where it was.

107
00:05:03.926 --> 00:05:06.856
It remembered that we weren't
showing any of the bars,

108
00:05:06.956 --> 00:05:10.176
remembered the size of the
image, and even some things

109
00:05:10.176 --> 00:05:11.306
that are behind the scenes.

110
00:05:11.346 --> 00:05:14.106
Let's go here, I'm just
going to peel it back

111
00:05:14.106 --> 00:05:16.946
with our cool new
gesture, and you can see

112
00:05:16.946 --> 00:05:18.726
that it remembered
the scrollPosition

113
00:05:19.606 --> 00:05:20.786
and the selected cell.

114
00:05:20.786 --> 00:05:24.156
So that's a pretty
unexciting demo,

115
00:05:24.196 --> 00:05:25.756
but it was supposed
to be actually.

116
00:05:26.166 --> 00:05:30.656
The idea is it's predictable,
the users get what they want,

117
00:05:30.886 --> 00:05:32.606
and it's nice and
easy for everybody.

118
00:05:33.246 --> 00:05:37.146
So let's look at what we did
in order to accomplish that.

119
00:05:38.176 --> 00:05:41.536
So first, what was
actually restored?

120
00:05:41.776 --> 00:05:44.876
We saw it from the user's
perspective, but as a developer,

121
00:05:44.876 --> 00:05:46.776
what were the constituent
pieces?

122
00:05:47.296 --> 00:05:50.306
We had a navigation controller.

123
00:05:50.606 --> 00:05:54.266
It remembered what
was pushed on it.

124
00:05:54.536 --> 00:05:56.876
We also remembered
the scrollPosition

125
00:05:56.936 --> 00:06:00.156
in our collection view
and the selected cell.

126
00:05:56.936 --> 00:06:00.156
in our collection view
and the selected cell.

127
00:06:00.796 --> 00:06:05.006
And finally, we remembered
what image we were showing,

128
00:06:06.206 --> 00:06:09.726
the transformation we
applied to resize it.

129
00:06:10.926 --> 00:06:15.456
So you'll find that when you
write state restoration code,

130
00:06:15.616 --> 00:06:19.446
a lot of what you do is map what
your application has already

131
00:06:19.446 --> 00:06:22.326
done into what you need
to save and restore.

132
00:06:23.186 --> 00:06:25.376
Typically, you'll find
that there's a lot

133
00:06:25.376 --> 00:06:26.746
of really strong parallels

134
00:06:26.746 --> 00:06:29.236
between code you've
already written, ad in fact,

135
00:06:29.616 --> 00:06:31.566
you'll be able to
leverage and reuse most

136
00:06:31.566 --> 00:06:32.486
of the code you've written.

137
00:06:33.126 --> 00:06:36.786
So here, let's see what happens
before we even saved state

138
00:06:37.086 --> 00:06:39.836
when the user selected
that cell and we pushed

139
00:06:39.836 --> 00:06:41.186
on that image view controller.

140
00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:44.526
If we didn't take any action

141
00:06:44.526 --> 00:06:46.286
and we just loaded
the view controller,

142
00:06:46.716 --> 00:06:48.306
we wouldn't have an
image or a title.

143
00:06:49.456 --> 00:06:53.126
We want to put something there,
and we also want to remember

144
00:06:53.126 --> 00:06:55.276
that we're going to change
that title up top, too.

145
00:06:56.546 --> 00:06:57.346
So what do we do?

146
00:06:58.426 --> 00:07:02.096
Well, we have a method called
prepare for segway that you use

147
00:06:58.426 --> 00:07:02.096
Well, we have a method called
prepare for segway that you use

148
00:07:02.096 --> 00:07:03.336
when you have storyboards.

149
00:07:03.956 --> 00:07:05.746
So that's what I have
in the example here.

150
00:07:06.486 --> 00:07:08.026
And then prepare for segway,

151
00:07:08.556 --> 00:07:10.706
I hand the view controller
that's coming in,

152
00:07:10.706 --> 00:07:13.686
our image view controller,
enough information

153
00:07:13.686 --> 00:07:16.296
so that it can get the
image and set that title.

154
00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:20.056
So now when I did that
segway, we actually have

155
00:07:20.056 --> 00:07:22.886
that information right there.

156
00:07:23.486 --> 00:07:26.966
So similarly, when I save and
restoreState, I'm going to want

157
00:07:26.966 --> 00:07:28.366
to be able to maintain that.

158
00:07:29.026 --> 00:07:31.106
So what do we do?

159
00:07:31.406 --> 00:07:33.286
Well, let's look at
how we saved state.

160
00:07:33.956 --> 00:07:36.266
When the application
goes in the background,

161
00:07:36.666 --> 00:07:39.686
we're going to go all the view
controllers with identifiers,

162
00:07:39.736 --> 00:07:42.276
all the view controllers that
need to save their state,

163
00:07:42.466 --> 00:07:43.616
and give them a chance.

164
00:07:44.186 --> 00:07:48.546
So we're going to call them
method encodeRestorableState

165
00:07:48.546 --> 00:07:49.116
with coder.

166
00:07:49.116 --> 00:07:51.266
We're going to hand
a key to archiver

167
00:07:51.266 --> 00:07:53.246
where it can stash any
information it wants

168
00:07:53.246 --> 00:07:54.116
to restore later.

169
00:07:54.566 --> 00:07:56.406
So what do we need to save here?

170
00:07:58.236 --> 00:08:01.876
Well, we've got the
image, also that title.

171
00:07:58.236 --> 00:08:01.876
Well, we've got the
image, also that title.

172
00:08:01.956 --> 00:08:05.566
But we don't want to write
out the bits of the image

173
00:08:05.566 --> 00:08:08.336
and actually save
an extra image file.

174
00:08:08.376 --> 00:08:12.176
And in fact, if you think about
it, you probably have one place

175
00:08:12.176 --> 00:08:15.646
that informs you of both the
image itself and that title.

176
00:08:16.406 --> 00:08:21.486
So let's just save an identifier
that we can use later to look

177
00:08:21.486 --> 00:08:22.726
up this information again.

178
00:08:23.246 --> 00:08:27.026
And that as simple as
just encoding something

179
00:08:27.156 --> 00:08:29.686
into that archiver that's
passed into the method.

180
00:08:29.686 --> 00:08:33.686
And you can see here my image ID
is a string, so I'm just going

181
00:08:33.686 --> 00:08:35.926
to encode an object,
give it a key

182
00:08:35.926 --> 00:08:37.366
so I can look it back up later.

183
00:08:38.496 --> 00:08:39.296
Anything else?

184
00:08:40.376 --> 00:08:41.956
Well, we also remember whether

185
00:08:41.956 --> 00:08:45.196
or not the user was showing the
bars on the top and the bottom.

186
00:08:45.576 --> 00:08:47.116
So how do we save that?

187
00:08:47.996 --> 00:08:48.836
Just as simple.

188
00:08:49.136 --> 00:08:50.676
Just going to encode
a Boolean here,

189
00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:53.046
and that's all we have to do.

190
00:08:54.696 --> 00:08:57.476
So you'll notice, I'm not
showing a lot of code right now,

191
00:08:57.586 --> 00:08:59.786
and there's a couple
reasons for that.

192
00:09:00.036 --> 00:09:03.966
One is, what's important is to
try to get the concepts across,

193
00:09:03.966 --> 00:09:06.746
so you can see what it is that
we're actually trying to do.

194
00:09:07.266 --> 00:09:10.026
If I show you the code, it's
easy to kind of get lost

195
00:09:10.026 --> 00:09:12.406
in the forest just
looking at it.

196
00:09:12.716 --> 00:09:15.416
Now, we have released the code,
so you'll be able to check

197
00:09:15.416 --> 00:09:17.796
out this whole example and
see everything I'm talking

198
00:09:17.796 --> 00:09:22.126
about here in more detail, but
you can do it on your own time.

199
00:09:22.906 --> 00:09:27.276
So how did we know to
call encodeRestorableState

200
00:09:27.276 --> 00:09:29.096
for that view controller object?

201
00:09:29.976 --> 00:09:31.436
Well, here's all
the view controllers

202
00:09:31.436 --> 00:09:33.206
in my application so far.

203
00:09:33.386 --> 00:09:36.206
We've got the navigation
controller, that collection view

204
00:09:36.206 --> 00:09:38.216
with all the little
images, the thumbnails.

205
00:09:38.216 --> 00:09:41.156
What we just looked at was
the image view controller,

206
00:09:41.266 --> 00:09:43.546
and of course there's some
views that go along with those.

207
00:09:44.976 --> 00:09:47.416
What you do is you give them
restoration identifiers.

208
00:09:47.696 --> 00:09:52.156
That tells us that you want us
to keep track of those objects

209
00:09:52.576 --> 00:09:54.826
when we save state and
when we restore it.

210
00:09:55.306 --> 00:09:58.736
And we will also call the
encodeRestorableState method

211
00:09:58.886 --> 00:10:01.876
on all of them so that
we save everything.

212
00:09:58.886 --> 00:10:01.876
on all of them so that
we save everything.

213
00:10:02.436 --> 00:10:07.256
Okay. So how about
when we restoreState?

214
00:10:08.246 --> 00:10:11.486
So at this point, the
application is starting back up.

215
00:10:12.746 --> 00:10:14.806
Do you need to do
anything different

216
00:10:14.996 --> 00:10:18.386
when an application starts up
when you're restoring state

217
00:10:18.386 --> 00:10:20.976
versus the very first time
the application launches?

218
00:10:22.236 --> 00:10:25.056
Well, when an application
launches, we tell the delegate

219
00:10:25.806 --> 00:10:30.386
that we're starting up, and here
we just simply call or recall,

220
00:10:30.796 --> 00:10:34.396
the method application Will
finishLaunching with options.

221
00:10:34.896 --> 00:10:37.006
And you don't have to do
anything different here

222
00:10:37.376 --> 00:10:40.966
in the state restoration
case; just proceed as normal.

223
00:10:41.626 --> 00:10:46.126
Set up your base interface, will
either load your base interface

224
00:10:46.126 --> 00:10:47.756
from a storyboard or a nib,

225
00:10:47.996 --> 00:10:50.056
or you can execute
whatever code you have,

226
00:10:50.056 --> 00:10:53.686
get your window visible,
and you're good to go,

227
00:10:53.686 --> 00:10:55.126
and that's our starting point.

228
00:10:55.686 --> 00:10:58.436
Then we're going to
go and we're going

229
00:10:58.436 --> 00:11:01.626
to call the restorationMethods
for the objects

230
00:10:58.436 --> 00:11:01.626
to call the restorationMethods
for the objects

231
00:11:01.626 --> 00:11:02.576
that are participating.

232
00:11:02.896 --> 00:11:05.366
So in this case, let's look
at the image controller.

233
00:11:06.866 --> 00:11:10.116
So here, you can see we're
starting off without our image.

234
00:11:10.246 --> 00:11:11.986
How do we get it back?

235
00:11:12.716 --> 00:11:16.696
We have a complimentary method,
decodeRestorableStateWithCoder.

236
00:11:17.106 --> 00:11:19.416
It's kind of the analog to
the one I just showed you,

237
00:11:19.446 --> 00:11:22.166
where you saved your
state, fairly logical.

238
00:11:22.166 --> 00:11:25.726
So what we're going to
do is we're going to pull

239
00:11:25.726 --> 00:11:28.946
in that image identifier,
which informs us both

240
00:11:28.946 --> 00:11:30.596
of the image and the title.

241
00:11:31.116 --> 00:11:32.486
You can see that I got that.

242
00:11:33.096 --> 00:11:34.006
Anything else?

243
00:11:34.156 --> 00:11:36.536
Well, how did we get it?

244
00:11:37.716 --> 00:11:40.816
Similar to the way we encoded
it, we just simply decode it.

245
00:11:41.046 --> 00:11:42.886
And when you write this
code and you look at it,

246
00:11:43.116 --> 00:11:45.106
the code itself is very simple.

247
00:11:46.326 --> 00:11:48.256
What's interesting
is when you think

248
00:11:48.256 --> 00:11:51.136
about how your application is
structured and see what it is

249
00:11:51.136 --> 00:11:52.696
that you need to
save and restore.

250
00:11:52.806 --> 00:11:54.546
The code is very boilerplate.

251
00:11:56.516 --> 00:11:59.816
We also kept track of whether or
not we were showing those bars.

252
00:12:00.466 --> 00:12:03.976
Again, we just simply
decoded Boolean and set it up.

253
00:12:04.436 --> 00:12:06.646
Now, I'm not showing you
the code that actually goes

254
00:12:06.646 --> 00:12:08.766
and draws the image
and sets the title.

255
00:12:09.766 --> 00:12:10.846
In your application,

256
00:12:10.896 --> 00:12:13.046
you've already written
the code that does that.

257
00:12:13.306 --> 00:12:15.716
When you first presented
that image view controller

258
00:12:15.716 --> 00:12:19.686
or used the segway transition,
you obviously have some code

259
00:12:19.856 --> 00:12:21.406
that goes and loads
in the image.

260
00:12:21.666 --> 00:12:23.036
And with state restoration,

261
00:12:23.486 --> 00:12:25.276
you'll always be
able to reuse that.

262
00:12:25.276 --> 00:12:28.376
So here, all we're trying to do
is get the information we need

263
00:12:28.376 --> 00:12:29.556
and then pass it around.

264
00:12:29.746 --> 00:12:32.546
And I'll show you that in
a little more detail later.

265
00:12:32.546 --> 00:12:36.926
So do we have to
do anything else?

266
00:12:36.926 --> 00:12:37.686
I mean, we had a lot

267
00:12:37.686 --> 00:12:39.136
of different things
getting restored,

268
00:12:39.136 --> 00:12:40.786
and I just showed you
a little bit of code.

269
00:12:42.256 --> 00:12:44.666
Remember, the navigation
controller remembered to stack.

270
00:12:44.666 --> 00:12:47.436
It remembered that we had
this view controller presented

271
00:12:47.436 --> 00:12:50.526
on top -- I'm sorry -- pushed
on top of that collection view.

272
00:12:51.816 --> 00:12:59.696
We also had scroll position
and our selected self.

273
00:12:59.876 --> 00:13:03.376
And we also had that image
sized up as it should have been.

274
00:12:59.876 --> 00:13:03.376
And we also had that image
sized up as it should have been.

275
00:13:03.816 --> 00:13:06.316
Did you have to write any
code to do any of that?

276
00:13:06.686 --> 00:13:08.626
Well, it turns out you
didn't have to do anything.

277
00:13:08.946 --> 00:13:10.566
You get all of that for free.

278
00:13:11.436 --> 00:13:12.556
And how does that happen?

279
00:13:13.496 --> 00:13:16.186
Well, I mentioned
before that when you set

280
00:13:16.186 --> 00:13:20.436
up all the restoration
identifiers, it both informs us

281
00:13:20.436 --> 00:13:23.796
of what needs to be saved but
also allows us to call methods

282
00:13:23.796 --> 00:13:25.076
to save and restore state.

283
00:13:25.656 --> 00:13:28.856
And we have a whole bunch
of base implementations

284
00:13:29.786 --> 00:13:32.416
that save all the stuff for
you which is very convenient,

285
00:13:32.696 --> 00:13:34.316
saving you the tedium of having

286
00:13:34.316 --> 00:13:36.176
to write these very
common things.

287
00:13:36.246 --> 00:13:38.886
So we keep track of a
lot of default behaviors,

288
00:13:39.246 --> 00:13:41.566
a lot of information
automatically for you.

289
00:13:41.956 --> 00:13:44.606
So you get a lot of leverage,
you get a lot of bang

290
00:13:44.606 --> 00:13:47.466
for your buck for
setting this up.

291
00:13:50.656 --> 00:13:53.766
So let's talk about
what's new in iOS 7.

292
00:13:55.196 --> 00:13:57.106
We had some great
successes this year.

293
00:13:57.496 --> 00:13:59.066
We've seen people
implementing this

294
00:13:59.066 --> 00:14:01.856
and some really nice apps
incorporating state restoration.

295
00:13:59.066 --> 00:14:01.856
and some really nice apps
incorporating state restoration.

296
00:14:02.576 --> 00:14:06.816
And we felt that we had a nice
starting point for all this,

297
00:14:07.296 --> 00:14:08.866
but that there were
some additional things

298
00:14:08.866 --> 00:14:12.096
that we could do that would
make it even easier to use,

299
00:14:12.506 --> 00:14:16.076
and also we wanted to continue
to grow as we add new facilities

300
00:14:16.256 --> 00:14:19.776
to iOS and as apps continue
to get more sophisticated.

301
00:14:20.656 --> 00:14:24.696
So let's look at what we've got.

302
00:14:25.276 --> 00:14:29.046
We found that with view
controllers and views,

303
00:14:29.406 --> 00:14:33.116
you sometimes wanted to also
have objects participate

304
00:14:33.116 --> 00:14:35.226
in state restoration
like a data source

305
00:14:35.526 --> 00:14:37.966
or some other nonview
controller object

306
00:14:38.616 --> 00:14:40.336
in the same way the
view controllers

307
00:14:40.336 --> 00:14:41.526
and views participate.

308
00:14:42.046 --> 00:14:46.906
So we added the ability for any
object to be able to get added

309
00:14:46.906 --> 00:14:51.626
to the state restoration graph
and save and restore its state.

310
00:14:52.326 --> 00:14:56.196
Also, we've made it
easier for you to figure

311
00:14:56.196 --> 00:14:58.026
out when you can apply state.

312
00:14:58.616 --> 00:15:01.266
Something that's a
little tricky sometimes is

313
00:14:58.616 --> 00:15:01.266
Something that's a
little tricky sometimes is

314
00:15:01.266 --> 00:15:05.096
when your application restores
all of its state but isn't sure

315
00:15:05.096 --> 00:15:08.216
of the order that different
things will get resorted in.

316
00:15:08.336 --> 00:15:11.056
So after you've pulled the
view controller state back,

317
00:15:11.466 --> 00:15:13.926
is it safe to go
and draw everything

318
00:15:13.926 --> 00:15:15.916
on the screen, or
apply everything?

319
00:15:16.226 --> 00:15:18.366
Well, it might depend
on other objects

320
00:15:18.366 --> 00:15:20.766
that are also participating,
and we don't want you

321
00:15:20.766 --> 00:15:21.976
to have to worry about that.

322
00:15:22.296 --> 00:15:24.926
So I'll show how we've
made that easier to handle.

323
00:15:25.466 --> 00:15:29.836
We've done a lot of work
with Snapshot handling.

324
00:15:30.916 --> 00:15:33.676
Previously when an
application restored state,

325
00:15:33.676 --> 00:15:35.146
we would show the default PNG,

326
00:15:35.146 --> 00:15:38.266
and when the application
started up, we would just jump

327
00:15:38.636 --> 00:15:39.766
to wherever its state was.

328
00:15:40.216 --> 00:15:42.486
Now to provide a more
seamless experience,

329
00:15:42.746 --> 00:15:44.966
we'll use a Snapshot
very aggressively,

330
00:15:45.146 --> 00:15:46.606
and I'll go through
how you do that

331
00:15:46.606 --> 00:15:49.186
and how you still have
some control over that.

332
00:15:50.056 --> 00:15:52.936
There's also some small
enhancements I'll discuss.

333
00:15:53.766 --> 00:15:55.366
We just keep adding new things.

334
00:15:55.696 --> 00:15:58.686
Last year in 2012 when
I talked about this,

335
00:15:58.686 --> 00:16:02.126
I mentioned you can implement
some state restoration

336
00:15:58.686 --> 00:16:02.126
I mentioned you can implement
some state restoration

337
00:16:02.126 --> 00:16:04.716
for your app and then
enhance it or extend it

338
00:16:04.716 --> 00:16:05.946
as you add new features.

339
00:16:06.276 --> 00:16:09.286
And we're taking our own advice
and doing the same thing,

340
00:16:09.556 --> 00:16:13.376
so we started with the most
critical things, the basics,

341
00:16:13.566 --> 00:16:16.376
and then we started to add
more things for this year.

342
00:16:18.106 --> 00:16:19.496
So that's what's new.

343
00:16:20.326 --> 00:16:22.436
Okay, first is generalized
objects.

344
00:16:23.076 --> 00:16:26.616
So the idea here is to be
able to take objects that are

345
00:16:26.616 --> 00:16:29.696
in view controllers and
views and also use them

346
00:16:29.696 --> 00:16:32.316
in the same way in state
restoration as you've been able

347
00:16:32.316 --> 00:16:34.586
to with our existing API.

348
00:16:35.696 --> 00:16:38.436
So here's two of our
view controllers.

349
00:16:38.526 --> 00:16:41.876
We have both the collection
view and then we also have

350
00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:42.696
that image controller.

351
00:16:42.996 --> 00:16:46.216
And a very common thing
in an application is

352
00:16:46.216 --> 00:16:48.686
to have a data source object.

353
00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:52.846
And with that data source,
you'll be referring to it

354
00:16:53.116 --> 00:16:54.846
for multiple objects
in the system.

355
00:16:55.526 --> 00:16:58.186
So here I'm using the
data source to inform you

356
00:16:58.186 --> 00:17:01.466
of what images I have, how
many, what their titles are,

357
00:16:58.186 --> 00:17:01.466
of what images I have, how
many, what their titles are,

358
00:17:01.646 --> 00:17:03.606
and to get the image
bits themselves --

359
00:17:03.606 --> 00:17:06.366
kind of wraps over where
all those images are hiding

360
00:17:06.366 --> 00:17:07.856
in the file system
so I don't have

361
00:17:07.925 --> 00:17:09.826
to replicate that
code everywhere.

362
00:17:10.376 --> 00:17:13.626
So I'm going to want
to be able to save

363
00:17:13.626 --> 00:17:15.935
and restore a reference
to that directly.

364
00:17:16.006 --> 00:17:18.896
I don't want to actually
encode the object completely

365
00:17:18.896 --> 00:17:22.316
and make copies of it; I
just want to refer to it.

366
00:17:22.316 --> 00:17:24.396
And the data source doesn't
actually need to save

367
00:17:24.396 --> 00:17:27.685
and restore any state of its
own, but I will want to be able

368
00:17:27.685 --> 00:17:30.476
to refer to it when I'm saving
state for other objects.

369
00:17:30.866 --> 00:17:34.006
And something that's
kind of similar is

370
00:17:34.006 --> 00:17:36.306
when you have a shared
object amongst the many view

371
00:17:36.306 --> 00:17:38.016
controllers that
might be dynamic.

372
00:17:38.726 --> 00:17:41.856
So I'm going to extend the
demo that I showed you before,

373
00:17:41.926 --> 00:17:43.976
and we're going add an
Inspector so we can set

374
00:17:43.976 --> 00:17:46.626
up some effects,
some image effects.

375
00:17:47.416 --> 00:17:50.426
And here you can see that
that Inspector and the image

376
00:17:50.426 --> 00:17:52.026
which is now kind of
a different color,

377
00:17:52.026 --> 00:17:54.016
are sharing a filter object.

378
00:17:54.676 --> 00:17:57.446
And this Filter object does
have some state, so it will want

379
00:17:57.446 --> 00:18:00.806
to save and restore state,
and I'll also want to be able

380
00:17:57.446 --> 00:18:00.806
to save and restore state,
and I'll also want to be able

381
00:18:00.806 --> 00:18:02.286
to maintain those references.

382
00:18:02.846 --> 00:18:07.856
So let's look at how our
example application has changed.

383
00:18:09.356 --> 00:18:13.426
So I've got a data source object
here which I just described,

384
00:18:13.516 --> 00:18:17.896
and it's being referred to by
both of the view controllers.

385
00:18:18.446 --> 00:18:22.016
Now, I'm going to
extend the application

386
00:18:22.016 --> 00:18:24.786
and add an Inspector, so I'm
going to present something

387
00:18:25.266 --> 00:18:27.546
and it's going to
use a filter object.

388
00:18:28.196 --> 00:18:30.706
In fact, I might have more
than one filter object,

389
00:18:31.836 --> 00:18:34.406
and they'll be referred
to for multiple places.

390
00:18:35.216 --> 00:18:39.056
So what I want to focus
on here is the data source

391
00:18:39.056 --> 00:18:39.976
and these filters.

392
00:18:40.026 --> 00:18:41.466
These are these objects
I'm referring

393
00:18:41.466 --> 00:18:44.056
to as generalized
objects, and we're going

394
00:18:44.056 --> 00:18:46.516
to see how they can play
along with everything else.

395
00:18:48.096 --> 00:18:52.426
The first thing you need to do
if you want to use these objects

396
00:18:52.426 --> 00:18:54.326
in state restoration
is register them.

397
00:18:54.976 --> 00:18:57.876
We've added a new
method, on UI application.

398
00:18:58.476 --> 00:19:02.926
It's called RegisterObject
for state restoration.

399
00:18:58.476 --> 00:19:02.926
It's called RegisterObject
for state restoration.

400
00:19:04.686 --> 00:19:06.936
I'm glad we have code
Complete, because that's long.

401
00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:10.696
This is very similar to setting

402
00:19:10.696 --> 00:19:13.096
up a restoration identifier
on a view controller.

403
00:19:14.116 --> 00:19:16.416
You pass in the object
and you can see

404
00:19:16.416 --> 00:19:19.106
that it actually implements
a new protocol, and we'll get

405
00:19:19.106 --> 00:19:22.606
to that in a minute,
then you also pass us a

406
00:19:22.606 --> 00:19:24.196
stringRestoration identifier.

407
00:19:24.916 --> 00:19:28.096
Now, for view controllers and
views we made this a property,

408
00:19:28.826 --> 00:19:31.926
but I didn't want to
force developers to have

409
00:19:32.026 --> 00:19:35.656
to subclass a base class
that we would contrive just

410
00:19:35.656 --> 00:19:37.216
so that they could
register an object.

411
00:19:38.136 --> 00:19:39.736
We need to hook in,
we need to know

412
00:19:39.736 --> 00:19:41.016
when the object's registered.

413
00:19:41.276 --> 00:19:43.646
I didn't want you to have to
subclass something and make sure

414
00:19:43.646 --> 00:19:46.796
to call Super, so we felt
this was a nice clear way

415
00:19:47.076 --> 00:19:48.996
to identify what's
participating.

416
00:19:49.086 --> 00:19:51.046
You just call this
method with your object

417
00:19:51.046 --> 00:19:53.546
and the identifier you
want, you're good to go.

418
00:19:54.466 --> 00:19:57.856
So let's look at that
protocol that I mentioned.

419
00:19:57.856 --> 00:19:59.756
It's called UI state restoring.

420
00:20:00.376 --> 00:20:05.226
It has the methods to save and
restore state for that object.

421
00:20:05.866 --> 00:20:07.356
These are actually optional.

422
00:20:07.356 --> 00:20:09.716
There's some cases where you
won't actually need to save

423
00:20:09.716 --> 00:20:12.176
and restore anything; you
just want to add the object

424
00:20:12.586 --> 00:20:19.026
to the graph of objects
we're keeping track of.

425
00:20:19.476 --> 00:20:21.976
We also have a property
that you can use

426
00:20:22.246 --> 00:20:24.286
to scope the object's
identifier.

427
00:20:25.166 --> 00:20:27.876
Sometimes you might want
to use the same object

428
00:20:27.876 --> 00:20:30.696
or the same class of object
in more than one place,

429
00:20:30.876 --> 00:20:33.896
and you'll have creation
code or something that sets

430
00:20:33.896 --> 00:20:37.846
up the identifier, and it would
be contrived to have to give it,

431
00:20:37.846 --> 00:20:39.946
the restoration identifier
some weird name just

432
00:20:39.976 --> 00:20:40.996
because of where you put it.

433
00:20:41.326 --> 00:20:44.286
As an example, let's
say on an iPad,

434
00:20:44.286 --> 00:20:45.606
you have an image editing app

435
00:20:45.756 --> 00:20:47.616
where you can apply
two different effects.

436
00:20:47.616 --> 00:20:52.116
So on the left here, you
can have one set of effects

437
00:20:52.256 --> 00:20:53.326
that you're showing
on the image,

438
00:20:53.506 --> 00:20:55.676
and you might have a
different set on the right side

439
00:20:55.676 --> 00:20:58.586
so the user can kind of
compare and contrast approaches.

440
00:20:59.316 --> 00:21:01.906
And you might be using
the same effect objects,

441
00:20:59.316 --> 00:21:01.906
And you might be using
the same effect objects,

442
00:21:01.906 --> 00:21:04.446
or the same filter
objects, and you just want

443
00:21:04.446 --> 00:21:05.606
to give them the same name.

444
00:21:06.026 --> 00:21:08.376
You can scope them by
setting their parent.

445
00:21:08.906 --> 00:21:11.006
Often you'll set that
to a view controller.

446
00:21:11.476 --> 00:21:13.706
You might set it to
another restorable object.

447
00:21:14.836 --> 00:21:16.616
This is what we implicitly do

448
00:21:16.766 --> 00:21:18.336
for the view controller
hierarchy.

449
00:21:18.586 --> 00:21:21.416
We actually keep track of
the parent of an object based

450
00:21:21.416 --> 00:21:24.056
on whether it was
presented, or if it's pushed

451
00:21:24.056 --> 00:21:26.896
on a navigation stack or in
another collection controller

452
00:21:26.896 --> 00:21:30.236
like a tab view, and here
we make it very explicit

453
00:21:30.236 --> 00:21:32.156
for you to do.

454
00:21:32.776 --> 00:21:37.326
Also, in some cases, the objects
may or may not exist depending

455
00:21:37.326 --> 00:21:38.806
on what the user has done.

456
00:21:38.886 --> 00:21:41.146
So I showed you this
beginning of the demo

457
00:21:41.146 --> 00:21:43.646
and I didn't create any
filters, so there aren't any

458
00:21:43.646 --> 00:21:44.936
in my examples so far.

459
00:21:45.926 --> 00:21:48.556
Now, if my application
starts back up, I don't want

460
00:21:48.556 --> 00:21:51.046
to create every possible
object I might have

461
00:21:51.086 --> 00:21:53.026
on the off chance I
might be restoring them.

462
00:21:53.026 --> 00:21:56.656
It'd be a lot nicer if somebody
kept track of that for me

463
00:21:56.926 --> 00:22:00.276
and told the application, "hey,
create this because it existed

464
00:21:56.926 --> 00:22:00.276
and told the application, "hey,
create this because it existed

465
00:22:00.276 --> 00:22:01.526
when you saved state".

466
00:22:01.986 --> 00:22:04.996
So by specifying a restoration
class, you're telling us

467
00:22:05.056 --> 00:22:08.576
who we can ask to recreate
this object as needed.

468
00:22:09.076 --> 00:22:13.296
And in the example
I'm showing you,

469
00:22:13.426 --> 00:22:14.976
all these different pieces here,

470
00:22:15.646 --> 00:22:18.786
these filters are
actually created on demand,

471
00:22:18.926 --> 00:22:23.886
and we'll see how
we can do that.

472
00:22:24.736 --> 00:22:26.676
This protocol that you use

473
00:22:27.026 --> 00:22:28.816
to create the object
is very simple.

474
00:22:29.216 --> 00:22:31.686
So we've specified
a restoration Class.

475
00:22:32.026 --> 00:22:34.326
When we're restoring state
and we need the object,

476
00:22:34.756 --> 00:22:36.086
we call a class method,

477
00:22:37.226 --> 00:22:39.346
objectWithRestorationIdentifier
path,

478
00:22:39.346 --> 00:22:41.986
and it gets passed
in two things.

479
00:22:42.686 --> 00:22:45.646
We give it an array of
identifier components.

480
00:22:45.856 --> 00:22:48.656
The last component in that
array is the identifier,

481
00:22:48.656 --> 00:22:51.396
and often that's all
you'll need to look at.

482
00:22:51.716 --> 00:22:55.286
However, that array contains
the identifiers for all

483
00:22:55.286 --> 00:22:56.966
of the restoration parents.

484
00:22:57.126 --> 00:22:59.906
That way if you've scoped it
and you want to be informed

485
00:22:59.906 --> 00:23:02.606
about which one of these
objects we're asking for,

486
00:22:59.906 --> 00:23:02.606
about which one of these
objects we're asking for,

487
00:23:02.956 --> 00:23:04.276
you have that information.

488
00:23:06.576 --> 00:23:09.556
We also pass in the
coder that was used

489
00:23:09.866 --> 00:23:11.536
when you initially
saved the object.

490
00:23:11.856 --> 00:23:13.566
So why do we do that?

491
00:23:13.566 --> 00:23:15.196
Why not just let you
create an object.

492
00:23:15.866 --> 00:23:17.076
Well, you're probably
going to go

493
00:23:17.076 --> 00:23:18.696
through some initialization
code,

494
00:23:18.936 --> 00:23:22.306
you may need some resources, and
it might be convenient to look

495
00:23:22.306 --> 00:23:24.096
at a little bit of
the information

496
00:23:24.096 --> 00:23:27.656
that was saved to
help inform that.

497
00:23:27.656 --> 00:23:30.926
Also, let's say that you
have a dynamic database,

498
00:23:30.926 --> 00:23:34.466
and we're restoring an object
that no longer corresponds

499
00:23:34.466 --> 00:23:35.836
to anything in the database.

500
00:23:35.836 --> 00:23:38.636
You might have synchronized
the database or changed things

501
00:23:38.636 --> 00:23:40.496
so that that object
doesn't exist.

502
00:23:41.046 --> 00:23:44.156
You can look in the coder
to find out if indeed

503
00:23:44.156 --> 00:23:47.206
that object is still around
or not, and if it isn't,

504
00:23:47.206 --> 00:23:49.046
you can just return
nill from this method.

505
00:23:49.336 --> 00:23:52.236
We'll be fine; we'll just
stop paying attention to it,

506
00:23:52.236 --> 00:23:55.186
we won't try to restore
its state.

507
00:23:55.666 --> 00:23:58.126
You return one of these
state restoring objects,

508
00:23:58.526 --> 00:24:01.036
and you'll all done.

509
00:23:58.526 --> 00:24:01.036
and you'll all done.

510
00:24:01.856 --> 00:24:04.656
So now let's look at when
we launched the app before.

511
00:24:04.656 --> 00:24:07.246
I mentioned when
you call application

512
00:24:07.246 --> 00:24:10.626
willFinishLaunchingwithOptions,
or rather, when we call it,

513
00:24:10.876 --> 00:24:13.686
you don't have to do anything
different than you already did

514
00:24:13.686 --> 00:24:14.936
when the app started up.

515
00:24:15.246 --> 00:24:18.726
But remember, in that method,
you're setting up the basis

516
00:24:18.756 --> 00:24:22.126
for your application, and if
we have a data source object

517
00:24:22.126 --> 00:24:24.756
that we want to refer to,
you're probably going to have

518
00:24:24.816 --> 00:24:28.206
to do something to connect that
up when you do your launch code.

519
00:24:28.596 --> 00:24:31.676
And here I'm adding
one line to register it

520
00:24:31.676 --> 00:24:32.796
for state restoration.

521
00:24:32.936 --> 00:24:36.286
Just as I showed you before,
we've given it an identifier,

522
00:24:36.596 --> 00:24:40.246
we've set up our object, and now
we know about it, we can find it

523
00:24:40.246 --> 00:24:43.166
if you refer to it while you're
restoring state, and when you go

524
00:24:43.166 --> 00:24:45.876
to save state, we'll
keep track of it for you.

525
00:24:46.416 --> 00:24:50.366
So let's go back to
that segway code.

526
00:24:51.026 --> 00:24:54.036
So before we even save state,
remember that we want it

527
00:24:54.036 --> 00:24:56.066
to switch to this
image controller.

528
00:24:57.336 --> 00:24:59.236
We're going to also hand
that image controller

529
00:24:59.236 --> 00:25:02.476
to the data source as well;
that way, it knows who to ask

530
00:24:59.236 --> 00:25:02.476
to the data source as well;
that way, it knows who to ask

531
00:25:02.676 --> 00:25:06.766
to get the actual image
file and to get the title.

532
00:25:07.376 --> 00:25:08.176
So here we go.

533
00:25:08.826 --> 00:25:10.996
Now, we've got all the
information we need

534
00:25:10.996 --> 00:25:13.796
and we've got a nice shared
object that we're using

535
00:25:14.196 --> 00:25:15.476
to keep track of everything.

536
00:25:16.176 --> 00:25:19.046
So what do we do
when we save state?

537
00:25:19.856 --> 00:25:23.156
Well, again, we want to
keep track of that image

538
00:25:23.156 --> 00:25:25.976
and the title, so we're going
to write out an identifier

539
00:25:25.976 --> 00:25:27.436
for those, but we're
going to write

540
00:25:27.436 --> 00:25:29.866
out an additional
thing, and what's that?

541
00:25:30.166 --> 00:25:32.876
Well, we want to keep
track of the data source,

542
00:25:33.136 --> 00:25:37.196
so that when we restoreState, we
can get a pointer back to that

543
00:25:37.196 --> 00:25:39.836
without having to do
an EndRun with globals

544
00:25:39.836 --> 00:25:42.036
or doing something
contrived to try to find it.

545
00:25:42.306 --> 00:25:43.516
We can just refer to it.

546
00:25:43.516 --> 00:25:45.686
How do we do it?

547
00:25:45.946 --> 00:25:48.856
Same way we save anything,
we'll just encode the object.

548
00:25:50.016 --> 00:25:51.936
Now, we're not going
to make a copy of this,

549
00:25:52.086 --> 00:25:54.756
because it's been registered for
state restoration and we know

550
00:25:54.756 --> 00:25:57.456
about it and we know that
it's a state restoring object,

551
00:25:57.906 --> 00:25:59.906
so we'll just save a reference.

552
00:26:00.096 --> 00:26:02.646
That way you don't end up with
a bunch of disjoined copies,

553
00:26:02.646 --> 00:26:07.616
strewn about your application
that aren't the right thing.

554
00:26:08.316 --> 00:26:09.286
How do we restore it?

555
00:26:09.946 --> 00:26:12.276
Well, you can probably guess
what's going to happen here.

556
00:26:12.756 --> 00:26:14.726
We're going to pull that
data source back in.

557
00:26:14.726 --> 00:26:17.946
That's going to inform
us of what image we want.

558
00:26:18.106 --> 00:26:20.616
Remember, we saved and
restored the image identifier.

559
00:26:21.266 --> 00:26:23.756
And now we're pointing back
at that data source object

560
00:26:23.756 --> 00:26:26.676
so we can use it and
everything's wired up just

561
00:26:26.676 --> 00:26:29.156
as it was when the
application was last running.

562
00:26:29.466 --> 00:26:33.316
So it makes it really simple
to maintain object graphs.

563
00:26:33.846 --> 00:26:39.046
And again, we just use that
coder, simple little line

564
00:26:39.046 --> 00:26:41.606
of code there, decode it,
and you're good to go.

565
00:26:43.566 --> 00:26:46.966
Okay, I'm going to show another
demo that adds on the first

566
00:26:46.966 --> 00:26:48.556
so let's take a quick look.

567
00:26:49.716 --> 00:26:53.616
Okay, so here we are,
back where we were before.

568
00:26:53.956 --> 00:26:57.466
Let's go back to this image,
make it a little bigger.

569
00:26:58.056 --> 00:27:01.966
So let's say that we want to
put a cool sepia effect on it.

570
00:26:58.056 --> 00:27:01.966
So let's say that we want to
put a cool sepia effect on it.

571
00:27:02.516 --> 00:27:05.936
So here's that Inspector --
you might recognize it from one

572
00:27:05.936 --> 00:27:07.226
of my screenshots earlier --

573
00:27:07.726 --> 00:27:09.906
and I'm going to dial in
a whole bunch of sepia

574
00:27:09.966 --> 00:27:11.986
because I don't think you
can ever have too much.

575
00:27:13.016 --> 00:27:14.016
See what it looks like.

576
00:27:15.566 --> 00:27:17.406
I'm a big fan of
sepia, actually.

577
00:27:17.996 --> 00:27:28.066
I think it can use
even a little more.

578
00:27:28.366 --> 00:27:29.576
Yeah, I like that,
nice and gold.

579
00:27:29.576 --> 00:27:33.226
And maybe I can soften
it up with some blur --

580
00:27:33.686 --> 00:27:34.776
that's my other filter.

581
00:27:36.966 --> 00:27:39.006
Not so much.

582
00:27:39.006 --> 00:27:43.156
I don't really like that, so
I'm just going to turn it off,

583
00:27:43.156 --> 00:27:44.816
but I'm going to keep
it in my back pocket.

584
00:27:44.816 --> 00:27:46.326
Maybe I can tweak
it a little more,

585
00:27:46.526 --> 00:27:47.816
make it kind of nice again.

586
00:27:48.736 --> 00:27:51.386
All right so let's put the
application in the background,

587
00:27:51.696 --> 00:27:55.006
want to go off and do something
else, there's something exciting

588
00:27:55.006 --> 00:27:57.596
on the Internet, don't
want to miss that.

589
00:27:57.946 --> 00:28:02.896
And then I usually
spend probably too long

590
00:27:57.946 --> 00:28:02.896
And then I usually
spend probably too long

591
00:28:02.896 --> 00:28:05.836
on the Internet, so the
application is exited now,

592
00:28:06.436 --> 00:28:07.886
so we're going to
start it back up.

593
00:28:07.886 --> 00:28:09.756
And let's hope that
it comes back.

594
00:28:10.356 --> 00:28:12.966
Again, my goal here
is unexcitement.

595
00:28:13.486 --> 00:28:15.856
So there it is.

596
00:28:16.256 --> 00:28:20.126
Now, it remembered that we were
showing this filter inspector.

597
00:28:20.126 --> 00:28:23.816
It also remembered that it
was disabled and that I had

598
00:28:23.816 --> 00:28:27.756
that radius set kind of
low, and it even remembered

599
00:28:27.756 --> 00:28:30.006
that we'd already applied
a filter to that image.

600
00:28:30.486 --> 00:28:33.366
Now, in an image editing
app, you'd probably play

601
00:28:33.366 --> 00:28:35.596
around with filters and
eventually you'd commit them

602
00:28:35.596 --> 00:28:37.886
and then it would save that
information in the database,

603
00:28:38.246 --> 00:28:40.946
but here I'm kind of in
an editing or playful mode

604
00:28:40.946 --> 00:28:42.886
where I haven't really
committed anything;

605
00:28:42.886 --> 00:28:45.246
I haven't modified this
image in the database,

606
00:28:45.496 --> 00:28:48.646
so I want state restoration to
keep track of what I was doing.

607
00:28:48.646 --> 00:28:53.646
So it got everything else,
too, just like it did before.

608
00:28:53.646 --> 00:28:57.776
If we go back there we can see
it's got our collection view

609
00:28:57.776 --> 00:29:01.226
and all that good stuff --
okay, so we got everything back,

610
00:28:57.776 --> 00:29:01.226
and all that good stuff --
okay, so we got everything back,

611
00:29:01.226 --> 00:29:03.246
no gasping, no flashing.

612
00:29:04.296 --> 00:29:06.606
Great. All right, what happened?

613
00:29:06.686 --> 00:29:08.116
What did we actually do?

614
00:29:09.466 --> 00:29:11.146
Well, just like before,

615
00:29:11.396 --> 00:29:13.516
we brought back the image
and the image title.

616
00:29:14.776 --> 00:29:17.026
but now we added
this new inspector.

617
00:29:17.026 --> 00:29:20.946
And it was presented, it was
a presented view controller,

618
00:29:21.336 --> 00:29:23.656
and that just kind of came
back in the right place.

619
00:29:23.886 --> 00:29:24.836
Everything was good.

620
00:29:25.876 --> 00:29:29.836
And we also had two filters
and these were those new types

621
00:29:29.836 --> 00:29:33.146
of objects that also get to
play with state restoration,

622
00:29:33.886 --> 00:29:35.636
and they had a little
bit of state,

623
00:29:35.636 --> 00:29:37.536
which they saved and restored.

624
00:29:38.776 --> 00:29:41.916
And then finally, we
actually were able to apply

625
00:29:42.196 --> 00:29:45.016
that to the image, and I did
that kind of behind the scenes.

626
00:29:45.426 --> 00:29:48.636
And this is interesting, because
when you do state restoration

627
00:29:48.636 --> 00:29:50.846
you don't want to just have
one of those Hollywood houses

628
00:29:50.846 --> 00:29:52.286
where it looks like a house

629
00:29:52.286 --> 00:29:54.856
but if you ever walked inside
there's nothing behind it.

630
00:29:55.386 --> 00:29:58.346
You actually want to restore
the entire structure of the app

631
00:29:58.586 --> 00:30:01.356
so that it presents
kind of a continuous

632
00:29:58.586 --> 00:30:01.356
so that it presents
kind of a continuous

633
00:30:01.356 --> 00:30:03.806
and seamless experience
when the user navigates back

634
00:30:04.016 --> 00:30:07.136
to where they were, that they
don't get anything unexpected.

635
00:30:08.596 --> 00:30:12.386
Now, when we initially
presented that inspector --

636
00:30:12.526 --> 00:30:17.086
again, I'm using storyboards and
I did a segway -- what did I do?

637
00:30:17.346 --> 00:30:22.346
I created that filter object
and then when I present it,

638
00:30:22.786 --> 00:30:24.716
it had that filter to refer to.

639
00:30:25.446 --> 00:30:27.036
That way I could
share the filter

640
00:30:27.416 --> 00:30:30.736
between both this
inspector and my image.

641
00:30:31.026 --> 00:30:34.126
You may have multiple objects
that are all sharing some state.

642
00:30:34.456 --> 00:30:37.906
I don't want to get two separate
filters eventually when I want

643
00:30:37.906 --> 00:30:41.586
to restore state, because as
I change the settings here,

644
00:30:41.876 --> 00:30:43.016
I want it to be operating

645
00:30:43.016 --> 00:30:45.466
on the same filter that's
being used by the image.

646
00:30:46.666 --> 00:30:48.576
By the way, again, this
is what's happening

647
00:30:48.576 --> 00:30:51.076
in the application before
I've even saved state.

648
00:30:51.386 --> 00:30:54.356
This is the, how did I
get to where I am piece.

649
00:30:54.716 --> 00:30:58.366
Now we want to save that off
so we can restore ourselves.

650
00:30:58.786 --> 00:31:00.046
So what do we do?

651
00:30:58.786 --> 00:31:00.046
So what do we do?

652
00:31:00.396 --> 00:31:00.906
Again,

653
00:31:01.226 --> 00:31:03.526
we use encodeRestorableState
with Coder.

654
00:31:03.526 --> 00:31:06.566
We're going to want to
save, whether or not

655
00:31:06.566 --> 00:31:11.486
that filter's enabled, and
also what we've got it set to.

656
00:31:11.826 --> 00:31:13.316
But here's the interesting
thing.

657
00:31:13.646 --> 00:31:15.876
Remember that I've got
this filter object.

658
00:31:16.846 --> 00:31:18.686
Why don't we use
that to inform us

659
00:31:18.686 --> 00:31:21.566
when we restore our state
rather than save it separately

660
00:31:21.566 --> 00:31:24.146
in the inspector, so
all the inspector has

661
00:31:24.206 --> 00:31:27.256
to save here is a reference
to this filter object.

662
00:31:27.956 --> 00:31:30.356
And this filter object
itself will implement,

663
00:31:30.356 --> 00:31:34.776
encode and decode, so
it will save its state.

664
00:31:35.256 --> 00:31:39.636
And we had one other object that
also referred to the filter,

665
00:31:40.166 --> 00:31:41.876
and that was the
image view controller.

666
00:31:42.466 --> 00:31:44.956
It'll also save a
reference to the filter,

667
00:31:45.316 --> 00:31:48.116
but they're both pointing
at the same object.

668
00:31:48.616 --> 00:31:50.026
So let's look at restoration.

669
00:31:51.806 --> 00:31:53.416
Yes, the filter object
is shared.

670
00:31:54.376 --> 00:31:58.896
So let's go through it in
a little bit more detail.

671
00:31:59.566 --> 00:32:01.426
So when we wanted to save state,

672
00:31:59.566 --> 00:32:01.426
So when we wanted to save state,

673
00:32:01.646 --> 00:32:05.476
we needed to register the filter
objects with state restoration.

674
00:32:05.476 --> 00:32:07.576
I've drawn them in a big
bright blue on the side

675
00:32:07.576 --> 00:32:08.546
so you can't miss them.

676
00:32:09.406 --> 00:32:11.406
We need to save references
to them.

677
00:32:12.476 --> 00:32:15.486
We want to save the information
that those filters have,

678
00:32:16.756 --> 00:32:19.336
so what we need to do is
we need to register them.

679
00:32:19.766 --> 00:32:22.356
Very simple, similar to what
we did with the data source.

680
00:32:22.856 --> 00:32:26.936
We're going to save a reference
from our image view controller

681
00:32:26.936 --> 00:32:31.206
to those filters and also
from the sepia inspector.

682
00:32:32.126 --> 00:32:35.976
And then the filters themselves
will save their own info.

683
00:32:37.246 --> 00:32:40.726
That's just whether they're
enabled, what the intensity is.

684
00:32:41.386 --> 00:32:44.446
Now, we're going to do
everything kind of in reverse

685
00:32:44.446 --> 00:32:46.446
when we restore, so
it's very symmetrical.

686
00:32:46.806 --> 00:32:48.566
But there's one other
thing we need to do

687
00:32:48.566 --> 00:32:50.126
when we're restoring state.

688
00:32:51.526 --> 00:32:54.136
Remember that these filters
may not have existed;

689
00:32:54.266 --> 00:32:56.636
if I hadn't used them,
they wouldn't be there,

690
00:32:56.636 --> 00:32:57.586
so I wouldn't need them.

691
00:32:58.206 --> 00:33:00.406
So we're going to consult
the restoration class

692
00:32:58.206 --> 00:33:00.406
So we're going to consult
the restoration class

693
00:33:00.406 --> 00:33:02.386
to restore them only
in the cases

694
00:33:02.386 --> 00:33:05.156
where the user was actually
using them, when they existed

695
00:33:05.156 --> 00:33:06.386
at the time we saved state.

696
00:33:06.716 --> 00:33:08.066
So that's what we'll do here.

697
00:33:08.976 --> 00:33:10.256
So we'll recreate them,

698
00:33:11.196 --> 00:33:14.566
we'll then restore
references, here's our filters.

699
00:33:15.006 --> 00:33:16.956
So we've just created
them again.

700
00:33:18.216 --> 00:33:21.746
The state restoration runtime
will ask the restoration class

701
00:33:21.746 --> 00:33:24.416
to create them by calling
objectWithRestoration

702
00:33:24.416 --> 00:33:25.136
identifier path.

703
00:33:25.586 --> 00:33:27.816
Now, you'll notice they
don't have any state yet,

704
00:33:27.816 --> 00:33:29.306
so what's going to happen next?

705
00:33:29.786 --> 00:33:32.526
Well, we're going to restore
our references to them,

706
00:33:32.866 --> 00:33:34.406
but they still don't
have any state.

707
00:33:34.406 --> 00:33:37.506
We're just going to wire them
up to our view controllers,

708
00:33:37.636 --> 00:33:39.826
so we can see there I
haven't actually applied

709
00:33:39.826 --> 00:33:40.656
that filter yet.

710
00:33:42.016 --> 00:33:45.206
So we'll let the filter
object restore its own state

711
00:33:45.206 --> 00:33:46.146
recalling decode.

712
00:33:46.816 --> 00:33:48.256
So now it's restored its state.

713
00:33:48.256 --> 00:33:50.146
I don't want you
to have to worry

714
00:33:50.146 --> 00:33:52.566
about what order this all
happens in, so I'm going to talk

715
00:33:52.566 --> 00:33:55.806
about how we can leverage this
later and make it real simple

716
00:33:55.806 --> 00:33:58.496
to apply it so that
you then eventually get

717
00:33:58.496 --> 00:34:00.676
that nice sepia look
on your picture,

718
00:33:58.496 --> 00:34:00.676
that nice sepia look
on your picture,

719
00:34:01.416 --> 00:34:05.316
and we're back to where we were.

720
00:34:05.966 --> 00:34:07.756
So let's talk about
how we apply the state.

721
00:34:08.085 --> 00:34:11.056
The first thing we do as we're
restoring is get back our image.

722
00:34:11.056 --> 00:34:13.755
But we can't go and
apply that filter yet.

723
00:34:13.926 --> 00:34:15.886
The filter might not
even exist at this point.

724
00:34:15.886 --> 00:34:19.485
We're just in the decode method
for this view controller object.

725
00:34:20.326 --> 00:34:22.626
And at some point we are
going to go grab that filter.

726
00:34:22.626 --> 00:34:24.886
It'll get created, it
will restore it state.

727
00:34:25.176 --> 00:34:26.366
Now we're good to go.

728
00:34:26.505 --> 00:34:28.206
Now we can apply that filter.

729
00:34:28.636 --> 00:34:30.456
But when? How do we know?

730
00:34:31.576 --> 00:34:33.505
So we've added a new method.

731
00:34:35.255 --> 00:34:37.966
This method's for view
controllers as well as any

732
00:34:37.966 --> 00:34:39.565
of the state restoring objects,

733
00:34:39.636 --> 00:34:42.946
and it decouples decoding
your state from trying

734
00:34:42.946 --> 00:34:45.466
to apply what might be
more of a global state

735
00:34:45.466 --> 00:34:46.726
across the whole application.

736
00:34:46.726 --> 00:34:49.286
It's just a simple
little method,

737
00:34:49.286 --> 00:34:51.716
application finished
restoring state.

738
00:34:52.016 --> 00:34:53.626
It's kind of like awakeFromNib.

739
00:34:53.916 --> 00:34:56.795
It's telling you, everything
is restored at state;

740
00:34:56.795 --> 00:34:58.936
everything is created
that we know about;

741
00:34:58.936 --> 00:35:00.246
it's safe to go in the water.

742
00:34:58.936 --> 00:35:00.246
it's safe to go in the water.

743
00:35:00.556 --> 00:35:02.226
Go on, apply your filter.

744
00:35:02.806 --> 00:35:07.936
So if we didn't have this, you'd
probably have code like this.

745
00:35:07.936 --> 00:35:10.046
Now, I mentioned I wasn't
going to show you much code;

746
00:35:10.046 --> 00:35:11.736
this is actually the
only code slide --

747
00:35:12.176 --> 00:35:14.866
so mainly because I
like this cool effect.

748
00:35:15.646 --> 00:35:18.716
So the idea here is I don't
want to update the image

749
00:35:18.716 --> 00:35:20.026
when I'm decoding my state

750
00:35:20.026 --> 00:35:23.126
because everything else might
not exist yet, so I'm just going

751
00:35:23.126 --> 00:35:25.196
to decode my state
and not do that thing.

752
00:35:25.746 --> 00:35:29.266
And then when application
FinishedResotringState is

753
00:35:29.266 --> 00:35:31.326
called, I'll call updateImage.

754
00:35:32.246 --> 00:35:34.706
And if you're wondering,
what's this updateImage,

755
00:35:35.566 --> 00:35:37.356
imagine I don't have
any stateRestoration.

756
00:35:38.076 --> 00:35:39.746
I have a segway to
a view controller,

757
00:35:39.746 --> 00:35:41.526
I tell it what image
I want it to show,

758
00:35:41.646 --> 00:35:43.766
there might be some
filters that are set up.

759
00:35:43.766 --> 00:35:46.086
So I'm going to write some
code that goes and fetches

760
00:35:46.086 --> 00:35:48.996
that imageAppliestoFilter,
sets the title, do all of that.

761
00:35:49.346 --> 00:35:51.356
That's updateImage,
and if you look

762
00:35:51.356 --> 00:35:54.276
at the sample code you'll see
that I'm able to just reuse

763
00:35:54.276 --> 00:35:58.126
that method when the application
restores its state here,

764
00:35:58.126 --> 00:36:01.376
so I don't have to go and write
a whole big bifurcated strategy

765
00:35:58.126 --> 00:36:01.376
so I don't have to go and write
a whole big bifurcated strategy

766
00:36:01.846 --> 00:36:04.776
for restoring the image and
setting it up in this case

767
00:36:04.776 --> 00:36:10.126
versus that case; got one
cute little piece of code.

768
00:36:10.326 --> 00:36:13.656
So there is one area where
we got a number of questions

769
00:36:13.656 --> 00:36:15.276
and they were kind
of the same question.

770
00:36:16.356 --> 00:36:18.886
When do I have to
create my objects,

771
00:36:19.136 --> 00:36:21.476
and when will you
automatically find the ones I've

772
00:36:21.516 --> 00:36:22.476
already created?

773
00:36:22.886 --> 00:36:24.386
You have a lot of
view controllers.

774
00:36:24.596 --> 00:36:26.896
You have some of these new
state resorting objects.

775
00:36:27.286 --> 00:36:30.966
And some of them exist when
the application starts up;

776
00:36:31.336 --> 00:36:33.176
others come into
being dynamically.

777
00:36:33.666 --> 00:36:35.626
So let's look at that
in a little more detail.

778
00:36:36.216 --> 00:36:39.356
So if you think of the set of
application objects you have,

779
00:36:40.006 --> 00:36:42.356
I like to refer to
everything that exists

780
00:36:42.356 --> 00:36:45.546
when the application is
already started as base objects.

781
00:36:45.966 --> 00:36:49.476
These are loaded from a
storyboard or from various nibs.

782
00:36:50.076 --> 00:36:51.366
They're created by your code

783
00:36:51.366 --> 00:36:53.766
in application
WillFinishLaunchingwithOptions.

784
00:36:54.166 --> 00:36:55.926
Before we do state restoration,

785
00:36:56.176 --> 00:36:58.416
they're already in
play, they exist.

786
00:36:58.776 --> 00:37:02.116
So if they're going to be using
state restoration and we need

787
00:36:58.776 --> 00:37:02.116
So if they're going to be using
state restoration and we need

788
00:37:02.116 --> 00:37:04.776
to find them, you don't
have to do anything.

789
00:37:05.226 --> 00:37:07.256
We'll just be able to
find them and look them

790
00:37:07.256 --> 00:37:09.326
up because we've got some
magical little tables

791
00:37:09.326 --> 00:37:10.796
where we keep track
of everything.

792
00:37:11.566 --> 00:37:14.396
What about all the
dynamic objects?

793
00:37:14.556 --> 00:37:16.576
These are presented controllers,

794
00:37:16.816 --> 00:37:19.626
view controllers you might have
pushed on a navigation stack,

795
00:37:20.216 --> 00:37:21.706
some of these restorable objects

796
00:37:21.706 --> 00:37:26.056
like those filters --
how do you get them?

797
00:37:26.286 --> 00:37:29.066
Well, if it's a view controller
and it's in a storyboard,

798
00:37:29.656 --> 00:37:31.826
you actually can get
it completely for free.

799
00:37:32.086 --> 00:37:33.096
We'll just find it.

800
00:37:33.336 --> 00:37:35.896
That's because we know what
storyboard it came from,

801
00:37:35.896 --> 00:37:38.016
we know what its
storyboard identifier was,

802
00:37:38.326 --> 00:37:39.516
so we can keep track of it.

803
00:37:40.106 --> 00:37:42.326
So you'll notice
when I presented some

804
00:37:42.326 --> 00:37:45.156
of those view controllers there,
I didn't show any code to have

805
00:37:45.226 --> 00:37:48.206
to recreate them and represent
them; we were able to go

806
00:37:48.206 --> 00:37:50.646
and hoist them out of
storyboards ourselves.

807
00:37:51.536 --> 00:37:54.476
However, if it's
not in a storyboard,

808
00:37:54.996 --> 00:37:56.906
or if you want a
little bit more control,

809
00:37:56.906 --> 00:37:58.736
you have to write a
little bit of code,

810
00:37:58.866 --> 00:38:00.946
and that's where the
restoration class comes in.

811
00:37:58.866 --> 00:38:00.946
and that's where the
restoration class comes in.

812
00:38:02.276 --> 00:38:05.166
So you can use a restoration
class for view controllers

813
00:38:05.166 --> 00:38:08.686
in the same way I showed you for
these new generalized objects.

814
00:38:09.266 --> 00:38:12.696
And also for view
controllers, as a fallback,

815
00:38:13.086 --> 00:38:14.786
we'll ask the application
delegate

816
00:38:14.786 --> 00:38:16.806
for them if all else fails.

817
00:38:17.426 --> 00:38:19.756
Now, if you implement
a restoration class,

818
00:38:20.146 --> 00:38:21.686
that trumps everything.

819
00:38:22.526 --> 00:38:23.766
That gives you control.

820
00:38:24.136 --> 00:38:26.766
Let's say -- going back
to my earlier example --

821
00:38:27.686 --> 00:38:30.316
maybe you have a dynamic
database with images.

822
00:38:30.316 --> 00:38:33.386
These can synchronize and
images come, images go.

823
00:38:33.796 --> 00:38:37.486
So if the image that was being
shown when you saved state isn't

824
00:38:37.486 --> 00:38:40.276
in the database when you
restore it, you may not want

825
00:38:40.276 --> 00:38:41.926
to bring back that
view controller

826
00:38:41.926 --> 00:38:44.476
and show us something
ugly like imageNotFound.

827
00:38:45.536 --> 00:38:47.116
You want to just
avoid it altogether.

828
00:38:47.116 --> 00:38:49.796
And it's always fine to
return nill when we ask

829
00:38:49.796 --> 00:38:50.726
for a view controller.

830
00:38:50.726 --> 00:38:51.826
We'll do the right thing.

831
00:38:51.906 --> 00:38:54.296
If it was presented, we
just won't present it;

832
00:38:54.296 --> 00:38:56.716
if it was pushed on
the navigation stack,

833
00:38:57.626 --> 00:39:00.106
we'll go one back and
so on until we get

834
00:38:57.626 --> 00:39:00.106
we'll go one back and
so on until we get

835
00:39:00.106 --> 00:39:02.136
to a view controller
that still exists.

836
00:39:02.956 --> 00:39:05.896
So we give you that control
to make sure that we don't go

837
00:39:06.046 --> 00:39:08.376
and force you into
some boundary situation

838
00:39:08.376 --> 00:39:11.636
where you don't have all the
assets you need that make sense.

839
00:39:14.436 --> 00:39:18.056
So here's the base objects in
the example app I showed you:

840
00:39:18.546 --> 00:39:21.666
the data source, that
navigation controller,

841
00:39:22.356 --> 00:39:23.266
and the collection view.

842
00:39:23.546 --> 00:39:25.306
They were all in
my main storyboard;

843
00:39:25.436 --> 00:39:27.106
they just got created
by the time I got

844
00:39:27.106 --> 00:39:29.606
into application
WillFinishLaunchingwithOptions.

845
00:39:29.916 --> 00:39:35.086
And I put that Inspector in a
storyboard, so then I was able

846
00:39:35.086 --> 00:39:36.476
to just completely
forget about it.

847
00:39:36.476 --> 00:39:37.956
I didn't have to recreate it;

848
00:39:37.956 --> 00:39:40.396
it just magically came
back, it was presented.

849
00:39:41.246 --> 00:39:43.456
Now, if I want a
little more control,

850
00:39:43.956 --> 00:39:46.796
I can take that image
controller, and even if it's

851
00:39:46.796 --> 00:39:49.576
in a storyboard I can still
give it a restoration class,

852
00:39:49.806 --> 00:39:52.976
or if I was creating it out
of whole cloth, myself encode,

853
00:39:53.126 --> 00:39:54.736
I'd give it a restoration class.

854
00:39:55.166 --> 00:39:58.856
And the filters, as we saw,
had a restoration class

855
00:39:59.106 --> 00:40:00.806
which recreated them on demand.

856
00:39:59.106 --> 00:40:00.806
which recreated them on demand.

857
00:40:01.066 --> 00:40:03.236
So when you think
about your objects

858
00:40:03.236 --> 00:40:05.596
and which ones need
a restoration class,

859
00:40:05.686 --> 00:40:07.496
which ones you'll
have to recreate

860
00:40:07.496 --> 00:40:08.496
when we're restoring state,

861
00:40:08.836 --> 00:40:11.426
break them up in your
mind, what's a base object.

862
00:40:12.466 --> 00:40:13.636
Then you don't have
to do anything,

863
00:40:14.026 --> 00:40:15.656
and of the dynamic objects,

864
00:40:15.926 --> 00:40:18.086
which ones do I actually
need control of

865
00:40:18.086 --> 00:40:19.666
or what am I going
to have to create?

866
00:40:20.186 --> 00:40:21.156
Makes it a lot simpler.

867
00:40:21.636 --> 00:40:27.216
I mentioned we did a lot
with Snapshot handling.

868
00:40:27.866 --> 00:40:31.136
So in iOS 6, we wouldn't
use the Snapshot at all.

869
00:40:31.136 --> 00:40:32.946
And that was kind of jarring,

870
00:40:32.946 --> 00:40:35.706
because the application would
come up with the default PNG,

871
00:40:36.066 --> 00:40:39.506
restore its state and then kind
of slap you when it went back

872
00:40:39.506 --> 00:40:40.896
to where it actually was.

873
00:40:41.056 --> 00:40:43.636
So we're trying to be
much more aggressive now.

874
00:40:43.686 --> 00:40:47.106
And we'll show the
Snapshot wherever we can.

875
00:40:48.106 --> 00:40:49.666
So when we launch
an application,

876
00:40:49.926 --> 00:40:51.596
if the Snapshot's available

877
00:40:51.596 --> 00:40:54.426
and if we can use
it, we'll show that.

878
00:40:54.426 --> 00:40:56.356
It looks much more seamless.

879
00:40:56.896 --> 00:40:59.806
However, there might be cases
where you want to use it,

880
00:40:59.806 --> 00:41:01.426
so we give you some control.

881
00:40:59.806 --> 00:41:01.426
so we give you some control.

882
00:41:01.426 --> 00:41:02.656
We've added a new API.

883
00:41:03.386 --> 00:41:06.246
This is on UI application
and you can tell it

884
00:41:06.246 --> 00:41:09.166
to ignore Snapshot
on the next launch.

885
00:41:09.736 --> 00:41:12.366
You'll do this while
we're saving your state.

886
00:41:12.836 --> 00:41:15.846
So if we're saving state in
one of your view controllers,

887
00:41:16.086 --> 00:41:19.316
notices, this is kind of tricky.

888
00:41:19.796 --> 00:41:21.166
I might not come back exactly

889
00:41:21.166 --> 00:41:24.126
to the same place,
ignore the Snapshot.

890
00:41:24.746 --> 00:41:26.116
Then we'll use the default PNG.

891
00:41:26.756 --> 00:41:29.796
That means only one of two
things will ever happen.

892
00:41:30.576 --> 00:41:33.896
We'll show the same Snapshot
that we're going to launch to,

893
00:41:34.216 --> 00:41:37.146
or we'll show the default
PNG, which is predictable

894
00:41:37.146 --> 00:41:40.206
and at least it's somewhat
familiar, second best choice.

895
00:41:40.826 --> 00:41:43.936
So why would you want us to
ignore the Snapshot, though?

896
00:41:44.566 --> 00:41:45.716
Well, here's some examples.

897
00:41:46.506 --> 00:41:49.206
Maybe your application is
showing a network error.

898
00:41:50.076 --> 00:41:52.186
Can't get on network;
please try again later.

899
00:41:52.186 --> 00:41:55.306
Click the application in
the background, it exits,

900
00:41:55.556 --> 00:41:58.886
user goes to maybe a better
coffee shop with free Wi-Fi,

901
00:41:59.576 --> 00:42:01.136
they start the app up again.

902
00:41:59.576 --> 00:42:01.136
they start the app up again.

903
00:42:01.136 --> 00:42:04.736
And it would be kind of
silly for this network thing

904
00:42:04.736 --> 00:42:06.376
to be showing, seeing

905
00:42:06.376 --> 00:42:08.916
that there's an error
freaking the poor user out,

906
00:42:08.916 --> 00:42:11.046
and then have it
just dismiss itself

907
00:42:11.046 --> 00:42:12.546
or disappear when
the app started.

908
00:42:14.336 --> 00:42:17.616
You also might have things
like a table view of data

909
00:42:17.616 --> 00:42:18.826
that changes frequently.

910
00:42:19.566 --> 00:42:22.176
Maybe you have the top
10 awesome kitten videos

911
00:42:22.176 --> 00:42:25.556
of the day, something
like that, and they tend

912
00:42:25.556 --> 00:42:28.076
to change pretty quickly, I
can tell you from experience.

913
00:42:28.396 --> 00:42:35.016
So the application when it
starts up, you might not want

914
00:42:35.016 --> 00:42:37.956
to show a list of things
that you're actually not --

915
00:42:37.956 --> 00:42:41.606
eventually going to land on,
and the user's stabbing away

916
00:42:41.606 --> 00:42:44.216
at this video and it doesn't
show up, so it might be better

917
00:42:44.566 --> 00:42:45.776
to avoid that altogether.

918
00:42:47.406 --> 00:42:49.306
There's also some implicit cases

919
00:42:49.306 --> 00:42:53.046
where we'll actually detect
Snapshot wouldn't be the best

920
00:42:53.046 --> 00:42:55.356
choice, so there's
a couple there.

921
00:42:55.616 --> 00:42:58.466
One is, if the top most view
controller doesn't have a

922
00:42:58.466 --> 00:43:01.496
restoration identifier,
we're going to assume, okay,

923
00:42:58.466 --> 00:43:01.496
restoration identifier,
we're going to assume, okay,

924
00:43:01.496 --> 00:43:02.636
you're app's pretty awesome

925
00:43:02.636 --> 00:43:04.296
and it restores state,
which is great.

926
00:43:04.456 --> 00:43:06.256
Thank you, but we can
tell that you're not going

927
00:43:06.256 --> 00:43:07.206
to restore to this one.

928
00:43:07.616 --> 00:43:09.846
There might be some
boundary area of the app

929
00:43:09.896 --> 00:43:12.556
that users rarely go
to, setting something

930
00:43:12.556 --> 00:43:14.276
up that they would
typically only do once.

931
00:43:14.676 --> 00:43:17.566
That might not be a battle worth
fighting for the first release,

932
00:43:17.606 --> 00:43:20.846
so you may not save the state of
that particular view controller

933
00:43:20.846 --> 00:43:23.426
and you may be focusing
on more important things,

934
00:43:23.906 --> 00:43:25.926
such as articles they're
reading and things like that.

935
00:43:26.416 --> 00:43:29.536
So in that case, if we
detect there's no restoration

936
00:43:29.536 --> 00:43:31.946
identifier, we won't show
the Snapshot; we don't want

937
00:43:31.946 --> 00:43:34.936
to give the user false hope
when it's starting back up.

938
00:43:35.886 --> 00:43:39.516
Also, there may be some
things that we don't restore,

939
00:43:40.136 --> 00:43:41.776
and I'll show you
an example of that.

940
00:43:42.216 --> 00:43:44.136
So there's a whole
bunch of areas

941
00:43:44.136 --> 00:43:47.386
where it's either inefficient
to try to restore everything

942
00:43:47.386 --> 00:43:49.086
or it's just complicated enough

943
00:43:49.386 --> 00:43:50.696
that we haven't gotten
to it yet.

944
00:43:50.696 --> 00:43:52.796
Similar to the advice
I gave last year

945
00:43:52.796 --> 00:43:54.676
where you take an
approach where you start

946
00:43:54.676 --> 00:43:57.226
with the most important
things and then add to it,

947
00:43:57.686 --> 00:43:59.066
we're in the same boat.

948
00:43:59.066 --> 00:44:01.006
So we don't want
to show a Snapshot

949
00:43:59.066 --> 00:44:01.006
So we don't want
to show a Snapshot

950
00:44:01.006 --> 00:44:01.946
if we know we're not going

951
00:44:01.946 --> 00:44:04.026
to come exactly back
to the same place.

952
00:44:04.816 --> 00:44:08.596
So I'm going to do another demo,
but this one's kind of quick,

953
00:44:08.696 --> 00:44:12.706
so I'm actually going
to use a movie.

954
00:44:13.106 --> 00:44:15.796
So here's our application,
we're looking at the image,

955
00:44:16.146 --> 00:44:18.406
and let's say that I go
to the activity sheet.

956
00:44:19.676 --> 00:44:24.186
Okay, so we actually don't share
the activity view controller

957
00:44:24.186 --> 00:44:27.126
state, and there's a couple
of reasons why we don't.

958
00:44:27.876 --> 00:44:30.916
Mostly, it's because the
application is handing us a

959
00:44:30.916 --> 00:44:31.946
whole bunch of data.

960
00:44:31.946 --> 00:44:34.656
It could have handed us a
video to mail to somebody

961
00:44:34.656 --> 00:44:38.666
to really annoy them, it could
have handed us a lot of content,

962
00:44:39.166 --> 00:44:42.326
and it can often be a
[inaudible] content or something

963
00:44:42.326 --> 00:44:45.376
that may not exist when the
application starts back up.

964
00:44:45.616 --> 00:44:48.026
So it would be both
be very costly for us

965
00:44:48.076 --> 00:44:52.906
to save all this data
and it might also bite us

966
00:44:52.906 --> 00:44:55.026
when we start the app back
up but we can't find it.

967
00:44:55.396 --> 00:44:57.366
And it could be confusing
for the user

968
00:44:57.726 --> 00:44:59.626
if they start the
application back up

969
00:44:59.626 --> 00:45:01.666
and they just see this
activity view controller

970
00:44:59.626 --> 00:45:01.666
and they just see this
activity view controller

971
00:45:01.666 --> 00:45:04.176
and they're not really sure what
it was they were trying to share

972
00:45:04.176 --> 00:45:05.366
or what they were trying to do.

973
00:45:05.536 --> 00:45:06.906
And you can see the
image peaking

974
00:45:06.906 --> 00:45:07.906
through a little bit here,

975
00:45:07.906 --> 00:45:09.856
but in other cases you
might not see that.

976
00:45:10.656 --> 00:45:15.086
So what do we do if we put the
application in the background

977
00:45:15.086 --> 00:45:17.346
and it exits and we
start it back up?

978
00:45:18.406 --> 00:45:21.586
So let's take a look.

979
00:45:22.146 --> 00:45:25.326
So I did something
kind of subtle here.

980
00:45:25.536 --> 00:45:27.876
It might not have jumped out
at you, so I'm going to replay

981
00:45:27.876 --> 00:45:29.486
that kind of in slow motion.

982
00:45:29.946 --> 00:45:33.706
So let's see the
application start back up,

983
00:45:34.426 --> 00:45:35.976
now watch the transition.

984
00:45:36.516 --> 00:45:38.086
See how it kind of faded in?

985
00:45:38.646 --> 00:45:42.426
It's very subtle, but let's
look at it if it doesn't do it.

986
00:45:43.416 --> 00:45:45.136
Starts up, boom.

987
00:45:45.796 --> 00:45:48.326
Kind of jarring,
kind of disjoint.

988
00:45:48.566 --> 00:45:49.336
See it again.

989
00:45:49.926 --> 00:45:54.156
So that's kind of unpleasant
as a user, and let's look

990
00:45:54.156 --> 00:45:56.126
at what we do regular speed.

991
00:45:56.766 --> 00:46:00.346
Nice. It just kind
of fades right there.

992
00:45:56.766 --> 00:46:00.346
Nice. It just kind
of fades right there.

993
00:46:00.646 --> 00:46:03.656
So at least we're not
slapping the user's attention

994
00:46:03.656 --> 00:46:04.366
around with this.

995
00:46:05.106 --> 00:46:07.726
So that shows a few
different things.

996
00:46:08.176 --> 00:46:10.706
Already in the previous
demos that I did,

997
00:46:10.946 --> 00:46:14.066
you saw us using the Snapshot,
so that covers the first part.

998
00:46:14.116 --> 00:46:16.676
Now when the application
starts up in restoreState,

999
00:46:16.826 --> 00:46:18.596
it really does look seamless.

1000
00:46:18.996 --> 00:46:20.416
You might have even
thought I'm cheating

1001
00:46:20.416 --> 00:46:23.146
and I didn't really kill the
application but I promise I did.

1002
00:46:23.776 --> 00:46:24.936
And in this example,

1003
00:46:25.146 --> 00:46:28.086
we're showing how you
both have control,

1004
00:46:28.086 --> 00:46:30.796
how we'll sometimes
implicitly notice

1005
00:46:30.796 --> 00:46:33.616
that we shouldn't use the
Snapshot, and how we'll do kind

1006
00:46:33.616 --> 00:46:36.706
of a nice transition
in these cases to sort

1007
00:46:36.706 --> 00:46:38.726
of ease the user back in.

1008
00:46:39.296 --> 00:46:42.796
So we've added a
few enhancements.

1009
00:46:42.796 --> 00:46:45.046
I'm just going to go over
them kind of briefly now.

1010
00:46:46.436 --> 00:46:49.526
We've got some keys that are
available in every coder.

1011
00:46:50.346 --> 00:46:52.466
So in the initial
implementation when we came

1012
00:46:52.466 --> 00:46:55.266
out with this last year,
an application could look

1013
00:46:55.266 --> 00:46:59.976
at the bundled version that
was used when it saved state.

1014
00:47:00.536 --> 00:47:03.216
So it could tell,
this old version

1015
00:47:03.216 --> 00:47:06.046
of the app saveState
I've changed drastically

1016
00:47:06.046 --> 00:47:08.056
so as I restore the
state I might have

1017
00:47:08.086 --> 00:47:11.206
to do some transformations,
or maybe I don't actually want

1018
00:47:11.206 --> 00:47:13.666
to restore state from this
very, very old version

1019
00:47:13.666 --> 00:47:15.536
of the app, it's just too much.

1020
00:47:16.306 --> 00:47:18.326
And that information
was available

1021
00:47:18.326 --> 00:47:19.626
in every one of the coders.

1022
00:47:20.166 --> 00:47:22.546
Most of your app might be
fine with this old state

1023
00:47:22.546 --> 00:47:24.956
but there might be one view
controller that's changed more

1024
00:47:24.956 --> 00:47:26.476
radically, so it
would look at this

1025
00:47:26.476 --> 00:47:28.036
and say, "hey, wait a minute.

1026
00:47:28.226 --> 00:47:31.396
Let me see who saved this state,
our old version of the app."

1027
00:47:32.416 --> 00:47:36.226
We've added a few new keys that
accomplish very similar things.

1028
00:47:36.396 --> 00:47:38.466
The first one is to tell
you the system version.

1029
00:47:39.626 --> 00:47:43.086
You may have noticed iOS 7
changed a little bit from iOS 6,

1030
00:47:43.576 --> 00:47:45.656
so your app might
need to adjust metrics

1031
00:47:45.656 --> 00:47:47.926
or do something different
when it's restoring state,

1032
00:47:47.926 --> 00:47:51.146
so you can tell what version
it ran on when it saved state.

1033
00:47:51.876 --> 00:47:55.066
Also, we put the time stamp
from when we saved state.

1034
00:47:55.376 --> 00:47:58.206
This was a very common
request, as it's so useful.

1035
00:47:59.006 --> 00:48:02.846
In some cases, after an app's
been inactive for awhile,

1036
00:47:59.006 --> 00:48:02.846
In some cases, after an app's
been inactive for awhile,

1037
00:48:02.846 --> 00:48:03.876
you might actually want

1038
00:48:03.876 --> 00:48:05.826
to restore something a
little bit different.

1039
00:48:05.826 --> 00:48:07.676
You might want to go
back up to the beginning.

1040
00:48:08.536 --> 00:48:11.626
Because it might be confusing
to the user if they dig way,

1041
00:48:11.626 --> 00:48:14.146
way down in the app
and then a month later,

1042
00:48:14.146 --> 00:48:16.496
when they run it again,
it goes to something

1043
00:48:16.496 --> 00:48:18.266
that doesn't even make
any sense anymore,

1044
00:48:18.266 --> 00:48:19.756
something that's
no longer relevant.

1045
00:48:20.296 --> 00:48:23.066
So you'll want to take
maybe a little bit of notice

1046
00:48:23.066 --> 00:48:25.456
of what time or the date
that this was saved.

1047
00:48:26.056 --> 00:48:31.266
It made it easier to
handle static table views

1048
00:48:31.266 --> 00:48:32.776
where their content
doesn't change.

1049
00:48:34.036 --> 00:48:36.876
Now, because a table view
can have dynamic content,

1050
00:48:37.406 --> 00:48:41.436
in the first release of
this, when we saved state

1051
00:48:41.436 --> 00:48:45.446
and we wanted to keep track of
selected cells and the top cell

1052
00:48:45.446 --> 00:48:46.416
that you were scrolled to,

1053
00:48:46.806 --> 00:48:49.666
we would actually ask the data
source for the table view,

1054
00:48:50.786 --> 00:48:55.176
what is an identifier for this
cell that makes sense to you?

1055
00:48:55.586 --> 00:48:58.696
The reason we did that
was because the cell

1056
00:48:58.736 --> 00:49:02.806
at index 3 today may not be
the cell at index 3 tomorrow.

1057
00:48:58.736 --> 00:49:02.806
at index 3 today may not be
the cell at index 3 tomorrow.

1058
00:49:02.806 --> 00:49:06.286
It may not even be the cell at
index 3 in 5 minutes or an hour.

1059
00:49:06.906 --> 00:49:09.546
So we don't want to just
select something based

1060
00:49:09.546 --> 00:49:12.226
on its index path if
that data could change.

1061
00:49:12.606 --> 00:49:15.936
So we would ask the data source,
who knows all about the data,

1062
00:49:16.516 --> 00:49:19.116
to give us some identifier,
which we would save instead

1063
00:49:19.116 --> 00:49:20.716
of just the index path.

1064
00:49:21.486 --> 00:49:25.826
And when we restored state,
we would then do the converse

1065
00:49:25.826 --> 00:49:28.866
and say, "here's an identifier;
where's the index path now?"

1066
00:49:29.486 --> 00:49:31.976
And that works out great,
especially if you have something

1067
00:49:31.976 --> 00:49:36.046
like music or photos or a set
of articles that could be moving

1068
00:49:36.046 --> 00:49:38.286
around and getting
sorted and changed

1069
00:49:38.286 --> 00:49:40.096
with things getting
deleted and added.

1070
00:49:40.816 --> 00:49:43.426
However, it's also pretty
common to use table view

1071
00:49:43.646 --> 00:49:45.066
for a static set of things,

1072
00:49:45.066 --> 00:49:46.836
maybe some switches
that you have.

1073
00:49:47.266 --> 00:49:49.216
Maybe that inspector
I have there might end

1074
00:49:49.216 --> 00:49:50.546
up with a fancy table view

1075
00:49:50.546 --> 00:49:51.966
with a whole bunch
of different items.

1076
00:49:52.236 --> 00:49:54.196
And it's kind of a
lot of work to have

1077
00:49:54.196 --> 00:49:57.406
to convert these index
paths into some identifier

1078
00:49:57.406 --> 00:49:59.436
that you contrive
and convert it back

1079
00:49:59.436 --> 00:50:00.576
when they're never
going to move.

1080
00:49:59.436 --> 00:50:00.576
when they're never
going to move.

1081
00:50:01.326 --> 00:50:04.916
So now, if your data source
doesn't implement the protocol

1082
00:50:04.916 --> 00:50:08.486
we detect to ask this
question, we'll just go

1083
00:50:08.486 --> 00:50:10.216
and save the index
path directly,

1084
00:50:10.326 --> 00:50:11.536
and it can be really useful.

1085
00:50:12.646 --> 00:50:17.686
And speaking of selected and
scrolled, we now added support

1086
00:50:17.686 --> 00:50:18.886
to UI collection view.

1087
00:50:19.176 --> 00:50:22.196
We'll remember all the selected
cells in a collection view

1088
00:50:22.276 --> 00:50:23.926
and also of the scroll position.

1089
00:50:24.316 --> 00:50:26.056
And you actually saw
that in the demo,

1090
00:50:26.386 --> 00:50:27.816
so we do that all for free.

1091
00:50:28.616 --> 00:50:33.286
And then finally, one thing that
can be extremely frustrating

1092
00:50:33.286 --> 00:50:36.066
to a user is when
they're composing mail.

1093
00:50:36.066 --> 00:50:38.716
Let's say that you find
a really awesome image

1094
00:50:38.976 --> 00:50:41.266
or an interesting article
and you want to share it,

1095
00:50:41.476 --> 00:50:44.126
so you bring up the activity
sheet as I showed before,

1096
00:50:44.446 --> 00:50:46.576
and continue all
the way to mail.

1097
00:50:46.806 --> 00:50:47.676
So now you're not

1098
00:50:47.676 --> 00:50:49.646
in the activity view
controller anymore.

1099
00:50:49.896 --> 00:50:52.146
That's gone, you're now actually

1100
00:50:52.146 --> 00:50:54.216
in a mail composition
controller.

1101
00:50:54.696 --> 00:50:56.546
And you type this
elaborate message,

1102
00:50:57.006 --> 00:50:59.836
put the app in the background
for whatever reason, it exits,

1103
00:51:00.366 --> 00:51:02.506
start it back up -- oh, no.

1104
00:51:02.906 --> 00:51:05.786
Gone. So we thought that
was a really important thing

1105
00:51:05.786 --> 00:51:09.316
to keep track of for users as
mail can be fairly lengthy.

1106
00:51:09.446 --> 00:51:12.726
So if you have an
activity view controller

1107
00:51:12.726 --> 00:51:16.426
and you give it a restoration
identifier, we'll keep track

1108
00:51:16.426 --> 00:51:18.686
of mail drafts and
we'll save them

1109
00:51:18.686 --> 00:51:21.226
and we'll bring the user
right back and restore them.

1110
00:51:21.746 --> 00:51:25.056
And over time we plan to
add more to this as well

1111
00:51:25.056 --> 00:51:27.956
so that we'll start saving more
and more specific activities,

1112
00:51:28.116 --> 00:51:30.276
but we thought mail was
the best place to start.

1113
00:51:36.376 --> 00:51:40.286
So I just want to take a moment
to talk about security and how

1114
00:51:40.286 --> 00:51:41.956
that relates to state
restoration.

1115
00:51:43.726 --> 00:51:47.816
We actually use data protection
on the archive itself.

1116
00:51:48.676 --> 00:51:52.926
So the state restoration archive
that's saved is not accessible

1117
00:51:52.926 --> 00:51:54.136
when the device is locked.

1118
00:51:55.376 --> 00:51:58.476
It's an encrypted file, and
if the device is locked,

1119
00:51:58.476 --> 00:52:01.026
even if somebody stole your
phone, managed to break

1120
00:51:58.476 --> 00:52:01.026
even if somebody stole your
phone, managed to break

1121
00:52:01.026 --> 00:52:02.996
into the file system
and pulled that off,

1122
00:52:03.246 --> 00:52:06.476
they wouldn't be
able to look at it.

1123
00:52:06.476 --> 00:52:07.806
So why do we do that?

1124
00:52:08.256 --> 00:52:11.176
Why is it important
to protect this file?

1125
00:52:11.486 --> 00:52:12.716
Well, there's a few reasons.

1126
00:52:13.136 --> 00:52:16.906
One is it's really easy to
leak sensitive information

1127
00:52:16.906 --> 00:52:17.526
by mistake.

1128
00:52:18.746 --> 00:52:20.846
You might keep track
of the scroll position,

1129
00:52:21.766 --> 00:52:23.176
which could inform somebody

1130
00:52:23.176 --> 00:52:25.156
who really knows what
the app's all about,

1131
00:52:25.586 --> 00:52:28.586
how many entries you have
and how you've been using it.

1132
00:52:29.086 --> 00:52:31.536
There might be identifiers
that you use for some

1133
00:52:31.536 --> 00:52:33.656
of your view controllers
or some of these objects

1134
00:52:33.976 --> 00:52:36.216
that actually give away a
little bit of information

1135
00:52:36.216 --> 00:52:38.066
about what a user is
doing with the app,

1136
00:52:38.276 --> 00:52:41.136
and for some business apps
or sensitive personal apps,

1137
00:52:41.486 --> 00:52:43.516
you might not want
anybody to know about this.

1138
00:52:43.846 --> 00:52:45.786
You might be adding
a new contact

1139
00:52:45.786 --> 00:52:48.326
and it's not saved
completely, but you're adding

1140
00:52:48.326 --> 00:52:50.056
in someone's personal
information;

1141
00:52:50.296 --> 00:52:52.046
you want that to
be kept private.

1142
00:52:52.916 --> 00:52:57.576
Also, your application already
may be keeping things private.

1143
00:52:57.576 --> 00:53:01.746
You may already be using data
protection for the application,

1144
00:52:57.576 --> 00:53:01.746
You may already be using data
protection for the application,

1145
00:53:02.156 --> 00:53:04.686
and we don't want to be the
weak link in that chain,

1146
00:53:05.026 --> 00:53:08.616
so we felt that it was
very important to make sure

1147
00:53:08.616 --> 00:53:11.986
that the state restoration
archive was protected

1148
00:53:11.986 --> 00:53:13.796
and that you didn't
have to worry about it.

1149
00:53:14.006 --> 00:53:17.186
So the action on your part,
you don't have to do anything.

1150
00:53:17.316 --> 00:53:20.146
You can put whatever you
want in there and not worry

1151
00:53:20.146 --> 00:53:22.866
about anything leaking out
because we're protecting it.

1152
00:53:24.076 --> 00:53:26.466
I'm going to come back to
that in a minute and see how

1153
00:53:26.466 --> 00:53:28.136
that relates to this topic.

1154
00:53:29.276 --> 00:53:32.036
So we added something
really neat on iOS 7

1155
00:53:32.296 --> 00:53:35.096
that allows applications
to run in the background,

1156
00:53:36.206 --> 00:53:39.706
and they can go and fetch assets
or do calculations or get ready

1157
00:53:39.706 --> 00:53:40.756
for when the user's going

1158
00:53:40.756 --> 00:53:43.136
to use the application,
which is pretty cool.

1159
00:53:43.606 --> 00:53:46.396
So if we're doing some
background operation

1160
00:53:47.786 --> 00:53:50.796
and the application
does state restoration,

1161
00:53:51.016 --> 00:53:51.916
we want to make sure

1162
00:53:51.916 --> 00:53:53.916
that everything comes
back predictably.

1163
00:53:54.296 --> 00:53:55.176
So what do we do?

1164
00:53:55.666 --> 00:53:58.056
So this is my application,
and let's say

1165
00:53:58.056 --> 00:54:00.996
that your application just gets
started up in the background

1166
00:53:58.056 --> 00:54:00.996
that your application just gets
started up in the background

1167
00:54:00.996 --> 00:54:03.686
and here's my little magic wand.

1168
00:54:04.316 --> 00:54:07.546
So your application just
ran unbeknownst to the user,

1169
00:54:07.756 --> 00:54:10.716
did its thing, and since
it participates the state

1170
00:54:10.716 --> 00:54:14.566
restoration and since the device
unlocked, when it starts up,

1171
00:54:14.566 --> 00:54:17.366
we go through the standard
state restoration flow just

1172
00:54:17.366 --> 00:54:18.356
like we normally would.

1173
00:54:18.686 --> 00:54:21.966
That's because the user might
take their unlocked device

1174
00:54:21.966 --> 00:54:24.696
and switch over to your
application, and we'd want it

1175
00:54:24.696 --> 00:54:27.996
to a restored state and be back
where the user expects it to.

1176
00:54:28.656 --> 00:54:32.716
But what do we do if
the device is locked?

1177
00:54:33.906 --> 00:54:36.846
Well, we can't access that
state restoration archive,

1178
00:54:37.566 --> 00:54:40.546
so in this case we
take a simpler path.

1179
00:54:41.096 --> 00:54:44.526
We let the application get its
work done, fetch its assets,

1180
00:54:44.826 --> 00:54:48.486
do whatever it needs to do in
the background, but we don't try

1181
00:54:48.486 --> 00:54:51.186
to restore state, we won't
be able to access the file

1182
00:54:51.186 --> 00:54:53.756
and it will fail,
and very importantly,

1183
00:54:54.246 --> 00:54:57.916
when the application finishes
running in the background,

1184
00:54:58.106 --> 00:54:59.576
we won't clobber the state

1185
00:54:59.616 --> 00:55:02.526
by saving whatever
its current state is.

1186
00:54:59.616 --> 00:55:02.526
by saving whatever
its current state is.

1187
00:55:02.736 --> 00:55:06.216
If the application is running
while the device is unlocked,

1188
00:55:06.216 --> 00:55:07.366
if it runs in the background,

1189
00:55:07.636 --> 00:55:10.606
when it completes its
background task and notifies us,

1190
00:55:10.866 --> 00:55:12.226
we'll save state again.

1191
00:55:12.226 --> 00:55:14.826
The application may have
changed its appearance,

1192
00:55:14.826 --> 00:55:17.886
it may have changed some of
the behavior when it did this

1193
00:55:17.886 --> 00:55:20.746
in the background, but
if the device is locked

1194
00:55:20.746 --> 00:55:23.836
and it couldn't restore state in
the first place, we're not going

1195
00:55:23.836 --> 00:55:26.506
to have it save state; in fact,
the app's just going to exit

1196
00:55:26.506 --> 00:55:27.926
after it's all done
with its work,

1197
00:55:28.226 --> 00:55:31.896
so that it's just getting work
done, loading those assets,

1198
00:55:32.266 --> 00:55:34.956
but not perturbing the user,
and when they start it back

1199
00:55:34.956 --> 00:55:37.906
up it'll go back to where
it was last time the device

1200
00:55:38.216 --> 00:55:41.256
was unlocked.

1201
00:55:42.066 --> 00:55:45.656
One other thing about this,
now that it's more likely

1202
00:55:45.656 --> 00:55:48.966
or that there's more potential
for our application to run

1203
00:55:49.226 --> 00:55:52.936
in the background, if you're
restoring state, keep in mind

1204
00:55:52.936 --> 00:55:54.266
when you start up,

1205
00:55:54.266 --> 00:55:56.556
the application's
data may be different

1206
00:55:57.336 --> 00:55:59.086
and that you might want
to take that into account.

1207
00:55:59.176 --> 00:56:02.066
And state restoration
is built around the idea

1208
00:55:59.176 --> 00:56:02.066
And state restoration
is built around the idea

1209
00:56:02.066 --> 00:56:05.426
that you should be able to save
state and then restore it even

1210
00:56:05.426 --> 00:56:06.936
if all your data has changed.

1211
00:56:06.936 --> 00:56:09.496
Many of the things I was
describing before are

1212
00:56:09.496 --> 00:56:10.686
about that very thing.

1213
00:56:11.126 --> 00:56:16.536
But just be sensitive
and keep it in mind.

1214
00:56:17.546 --> 00:56:20.606
So now you've gone and
implemented state restoration,

1215
00:56:20.986 --> 00:56:21.776
but you want to be sure

1216
00:56:21.776 --> 00:56:23.586
that your application's
doing the right thing.

1217
00:56:24.146 --> 00:56:26.086
So do we have any tools
that can help you?

1218
00:56:26.946 --> 00:56:30.536
Well, one of the problems
with developing this

1219
00:56:30.536 --> 00:56:34.736
that you might run into, the
archive itself is fairly opaque.

1220
00:56:34.736 --> 00:56:36.006
It's not a text file.

1221
00:56:36.006 --> 00:56:37.586
You can't just go and look at.

1222
00:56:37.906 --> 00:56:39.556
So how do you tell
what's in there?

1223
00:56:39.986 --> 00:56:43.506
How can you ensure that you've
actually saved what you intended

1224
00:56:43.506 --> 00:56:46.266
to save and make sure
that we've kept track

1225
00:56:46.266 --> 00:56:48.036
of everything that you expect?

1226
00:56:48.766 --> 00:56:52.016
Well, we have a new tool that
we're going to make available

1227
00:56:52.486 --> 00:56:53.996
from our developer support.

1228
00:56:54.396 --> 00:56:57.396
You can run this tool and
it'll output everything that's

1229
00:56:57.396 --> 00:56:58.106
in the archive.

1230
00:56:58.216 --> 00:57:00.456
I'm just going to show
you a little bit of that.

1231
00:56:58.216 --> 00:57:00.456
I'm just going to show
you a little bit of that.

1232
00:57:01.156 --> 00:57:04.466
Kind of looks like one of those
1960s movies about computers

1233
00:57:04.526 --> 00:57:07.876
so very textual but
very informative.

1234
00:57:08.406 --> 00:57:10.916
So you're going to see a whole
bunch of stuff like this,

1235
00:57:10.916 --> 00:57:12.556
and this is just kind
of the top of it.

1236
00:57:13.666 --> 00:57:16.986
So this first tells you what
objects have restoration

1237
00:57:16.986 --> 00:57:20.196
classes, and that's real useful
because a common problem is

1238
00:57:20.196 --> 00:57:23.556
when you forget to set a
restoration class or you set one

1239
00:57:23.556 --> 00:57:25.376
by mistake on something
that doesn't need it

1240
00:57:25.376 --> 00:57:26.136
and you're wondering,

1241
00:57:26.506 --> 00:57:28.376
either you're not
getting any objects back

1242
00:57:28.376 --> 00:57:30.316
or you're getting two
for the price of one.

1243
00:57:30.736 --> 00:57:34.066
So right here you can look and
see everything that we expect

1244
00:57:34.066 --> 00:57:35.626
to use a restoration class.

1245
00:57:36.916 --> 00:57:39.886
Also, we just have a set
of top level information.

1246
00:57:39.886 --> 00:57:42.456
So I mentioned we keep
track of the bundle version.

1247
00:57:43.016 --> 00:57:46.236
We also have these new keys,
when did you save your state.

1248
00:57:46.566 --> 00:57:48.826
What was the system
version that was used

1249
00:57:48.826 --> 00:57:49.796
when we saved the state?

1250
00:57:50.776 --> 00:57:54.256
And then for all of the
objects that are participating,

1251
00:57:54.636 --> 00:57:56.576
we save a bunch of
information about those.

1252
00:57:56.916 --> 00:57:58.556
So here's our image
view controller.

1253
00:57:59.196 --> 00:58:01.926
So you can see on the top
there highlighted in yellow,

1254
00:57:59.196 --> 00:58:01.926
So you can see on the top
there highlighted in yellow,

1255
00:58:02.306 --> 00:58:05.336
we tell you the type of object
it is, so you can kind of scan

1256
00:58:05.336 --> 00:58:07.316
down -- very quickly
looking for view controller,

1257
00:58:07.316 --> 00:58:10.136
view controller -- and it also
tells you the class of it,

1258
00:58:10.416 --> 00:58:12.006
so you can look at
it and go, "hm,

1259
00:58:12.006 --> 00:58:13.526
that's not the class I expected.

1260
00:58:13.526 --> 00:58:14.476
How did that happen?"

1261
00:58:14.536 --> 00:58:17.056
And you can also look
at what it saved.

1262
00:58:17.056 --> 00:58:20.166
And this stuff is very,
very straightforward, right?

1263
00:58:20.596 --> 00:58:22.346
We referred to our data source.

1264
00:58:22.656 --> 00:58:25.576
Notice it says, "object
identifier proxy."

1265
00:58:25.776 --> 00:58:28.046
That means this is a reference

1266
00:58:28.046 --> 00:58:30.126
to an object that's
also participating

1267
00:58:30.126 --> 00:58:32.686
in state restoration and
not an actual object.

1268
00:58:33.446 --> 00:58:36.856
Here, I actually put my
filters into a dictionary,

1269
00:58:37.006 --> 00:58:40.016
so this is just a textual
representation of a dictionary.

1270
00:58:40.366 --> 00:58:42.536
So the dictionary
itself was encoded

1271
00:58:43.476 --> 00:58:46.106
and the keys were encoded,
but you'll notice again,

1272
00:58:46.216 --> 00:58:48.696
we're using proxies
for the actual objects,

1273
00:58:48.876 --> 00:58:50.496
the filter objects
in the dictionary.

1274
00:58:51.006 --> 00:58:54.816
And here's the identifier
for the image as well.

1275
00:58:55.326 --> 00:58:58.316
So sometimes when you're
trying to diagnose issues,

1276
00:58:58.546 --> 00:59:00.296
you can learn quite a lot simply

1277
00:58:58.546 --> 00:59:00.296
you can learn quite a lot simply

1278
00:59:00.296 --> 00:59:02.456
by taking a look
at your archive.

1279
00:59:02.786 --> 00:59:06.156
And I think it's very useful
as you're building new code

1280
00:59:06.156 --> 00:59:09.096
and you're testing things,
to just take the time to go

1281
00:59:09.096 --> 00:59:12.886
through here and make sure
everything you expect is in it.

1282
00:59:14.596 --> 00:59:16.716
Now, I mentioned that
we can pull things

1283
00:59:16.716 --> 00:59:18.466
out of the storyboard
automatically.

1284
00:59:18.886 --> 00:59:21.686
So here I'm just showing that
we keep track of the name

1285
00:59:21.686 --> 00:59:25.426
of the storyboard and also what
the storyboard identifier was.

1286
00:59:25.816 --> 00:59:27.776
And that might be
useful to you as well,

1287
00:59:27.776 --> 00:59:29.866
even if you're not
depending on this behavior,

1288
00:59:30.266 --> 00:59:32.586
just so that it helps
you to triangulate

1289
00:59:32.586 --> 00:59:34.816
on what this object actually is.

1290
00:59:34.926 --> 00:59:37.116
You're not going to have a
picture of the view controller

1291
00:59:37.116 --> 00:59:39.386
on the right as I'm showing
here; you're just going

1292
00:59:39.386 --> 00:59:41.446
to be looking at text
and you might think,

1293
00:59:41.446 --> 00:59:42.886
what is this thing
I'm looking at?

1294
00:59:43.066 --> 00:59:44.766
Oh, came out of the storyboard.

1295
00:59:45.266 --> 00:59:45.726
There we go.

1296
00:59:46.496 --> 00:59:49.426
Okay. How about these
generalized objects?

1297
00:59:49.786 --> 00:59:51.296
Again, we do the same thing.

1298
00:59:51.296 --> 00:59:54.426
We're showing that it's
just a general object,

1299
00:59:54.426 --> 00:59:56.956
it says restorable object
-- that's my terminology.

1300
00:59:57.556 --> 01:00:01.036
We show the class of it, and
it saved a couple things,

1301
00:59:57.556 --> 01:00:01.036
We show the class of it, and
it saved a couple things,

1302
01:00:01.156 --> 01:00:02.796
so we just keep track
of all of that.

1303
01:00:03.186 --> 01:00:06.436
So pretty dry, but I think
it's very interesting

1304
01:00:06.596 --> 01:00:07.646
when you see all of this.

1305
01:00:08.336 --> 01:00:09.996
Okay, I'm kind of
running out of time,

1306
01:00:09.996 --> 01:00:11.496
but I have a couple more things.

1307
01:00:11.876 --> 01:00:14.706
We've added a profile
you can install

1308
01:00:14.706 --> 01:00:17.036
and we'll log a little
bit of extra information.

1309
01:00:17.406 --> 01:00:19.636
You can also set a
default for the simulator.

1310
01:00:19.826 --> 01:00:23.576
So you get kind of a play
by play in Xcode's console

1311
01:00:23.576 --> 01:00:25.916
as your app is saving
state and restoring it,

1312
01:00:25.916 --> 01:00:28.266
and it could be pretty
useful to look at that, too.

1313
01:00:28.886 --> 01:00:32.686
And we have a profile that
you can install that puts you

1314
01:00:32.686 --> 01:00:34.046
in what I call developer mode.

1315
01:00:34.396 --> 01:00:36.156
That's what I was
using in my demo

1316
01:00:36.156 --> 01:00:38.126
so that I could kill
the application

1317
01:00:38.386 --> 01:00:40.156
without losing state
restoration.

1318
01:00:40.546 --> 01:00:42.716
And it's really useful
when you're chasing a bug

1319
01:00:42.716 --> 01:00:45.426
or you just want to check things
and you want to be able to go

1320
01:00:45.426 --> 01:00:51.226
on the switcher and kill it but
not actually lose the archive.

1321
01:00:51.786 --> 01:00:53.646
So we did a recap.

1322
01:00:53.646 --> 01:00:55.976
I'm hoping that if you
haven't used state restoration,

1323
01:00:56.256 --> 01:00:59.056
this shows you just how easy
it can be to incorporate it

1324
01:00:59.116 --> 01:01:02.536
in your app, and you'll go back
and you'll want to take a look

1325
01:00:59.116 --> 01:01:02.536
in your app, and you'll go back
and you'll want to take a look

1326
01:01:02.536 --> 01:01:03.906
at this and see what you can do.

1327
01:01:04.486 --> 01:01:06.296
And for those of you who
have already been using it

1328
01:01:06.296 --> 01:01:09.976
and new people as well, I hope
that the new features show you

1329
01:01:09.976 --> 01:01:11.816
that you can also extend things

1330
01:01:11.816 --> 01:01:13.826
and it makes it even
easier to use.

1331
01:01:14.036 --> 01:01:16.126
Talked a little bit
about security

1332
01:01:16.476 --> 01:01:18.046
