[ Silence ]

2
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.486
>> Todd Fernandez: Good morning,
and welcome Session 300,

3
00:00:12.486 --> 00:00:13.556
Managing Apple Devices.

4
00:00:14.096 --> 00:00:16.616
I'm Todd Fernandez and
I'm very happy to be here

5
00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:19.066
with you this morning
representing not only my own

6
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:21.476
engineering teams, but
a number of other teams

7
00:00:21.476 --> 00:00:23.366
from across the company
who had been hard

8
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:25.556
at work making some
exciting changes

9
00:00:25.556 --> 00:00:27.266
in how Apple devices
can be managed

10
00:00:27.486 --> 00:00:29.226
in education and enterprise.

11
00:00:29.686 --> 00:00:31.206
Look out, I just
said the E word.

12
00:00:32.375 --> 00:00:37.896
In days of yore, device
management was based

13
00:00:37.896 --> 00:00:39.316
on the desktop PC model.

14
00:00:39.986 --> 00:00:42.356
IT departments would receive
a shipment of computers,

15
00:00:43.006 --> 00:00:46.656
they'd erase them, install
a corporate custom image

16
00:00:46.896 --> 00:00:49.796
containing whatever software
and policies and settings

17
00:00:49.796 --> 00:00:50.976
that they felt were appropriate.

18
00:00:52.016 --> 00:00:54.326
They distribute those computers
out to their end users.

19
00:00:55.006 --> 00:00:57.036
Periodically, IT
may update them.

20
00:00:58.276 --> 00:01:00.736
This model worked reasonably
well for a long time,

21
00:00:58.276 --> 00:01:00.736
This model worked reasonably
well for a long time,

22
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:04.426
but times have changed
and we here

23
00:01:04.426 --> 00:01:06.236
at Apple will modestly
take most of the credit.

24
00:01:07.236 --> 00:01:09.306
Customers now have much
higher expectations.

25
00:01:09.716 --> 00:01:11.636
They're no longer
satisfied with the static

26
00:01:11.636 --> 00:01:14.156
and monolithic system imaging
methodologies of the past.

27
00:01:15.176 --> 00:01:17.136
They now expect from their
device management tools

28
00:01:17.476 --> 00:01:19.126
that they are dynamic
and on demand

29
00:01:19.126 --> 00:01:21.296
and provide over-the-air
device management capabilities.

30
00:01:22.116 --> 00:01:24.426
In short, devices
are now mobile.

31
00:01:24.576 --> 00:01:29.156
iOS and the App Store introduced
the new model for deployment

32
00:01:29.156 --> 00:01:31.696
and management and we want
to complete that transition

33
00:01:31.696 --> 00:01:32.936
for all Apple devices.

34
00:01:34.316 --> 00:01:36.416
People are now buying their
own devices and wanting

35
00:01:36.416 --> 00:01:38.496
to bring them and use
them at school and work.

36
00:01:39.286 --> 00:01:41.486
They're very comfortable
installing their own apps

37
00:01:41.556 --> 00:01:44.376
and configuring those
devices to access resources

38
00:01:44.376 --> 00:01:46.526
and information whether
they're on the road,

39
00:01:46.796 --> 00:01:49.106
in the office, at
school or at home.

40
00:01:50.146 --> 00:01:52.396
This has presented IT
departments with the challenge

41
00:01:52.396 --> 00:01:53.886
of supporting this multitude

42
00:01:53.886 --> 00:01:57.256
of deployment models while
still providing easy setup,

43
00:01:57.926 --> 00:02:00.636
enforcing security policies
and distributing apps

44
00:01:57.926 --> 00:02:00.636
enforcing security policies
and distributing apps

45
00:02:00.636 --> 00:02:02.376
and other content out
to their end users.

46
00:02:03.316 --> 00:02:07.346
Our goal is to enable those
organizations to manage all

47
00:02:07.346 --> 00:02:10.645
of their Apple devices in the
same ways with the same tools.

48
00:02:11.596 --> 00:02:13.686
We've been working towards
this goal for some time

49
00:02:13.736 --> 00:02:15.376
and we're taking
a big step forward

50
00:02:15.676 --> 00:02:17.896
with some powerful new device
management capabilities

51
00:02:17.896 --> 00:02:21.676
that we've built in to both
iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks.

52
00:02:24.166 --> 00:02:27.806
People love how easy it is to
set up their new Mac, or iPad

53
00:02:27.806 --> 00:02:29.366
or iPhone or iPod Touch.

54
00:02:29.866 --> 00:02:32.136
Within minutes, they are
connected to the internet,

55
00:02:32.466 --> 00:02:34.296
installing apps and
communicating

56
00:02:34.296 --> 00:02:35.356
with their friends and family.

57
00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:40.636
And now, the same experience
is available to businesses

58
00:02:40.636 --> 00:02:44.156
and schools to simplify
setup and management

59
00:02:44.156 --> 00:02:46.016
of large numbers
of Apple devices.

60
00:02:48.016 --> 00:02:50.436
We've greatly enhanced
app and book management,

61
00:02:50.956 --> 00:02:53.596
dramatically simplified
device enrollment interval,

62
00:02:53.596 --> 00:02:57.876
remote device management systems
and made a ton of enhancements

63
00:02:57.876 --> 00:03:01.036
and added new capabilities
that enable organizations

64
00:02:57.876 --> 00:03:01.036
and added new capabilities
that enable organizations

65
00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:05.026
to get more control over their
devices while still preserving

66
00:03:05.026 --> 00:03:07.966
the great experience that users
have come to expect from Apple.

67
00:03:08.536 --> 00:03:13.876
So our agenda today, we'll begin
by covering the large number

68
00:03:13.876 --> 00:03:16.126
of small to medium size
changes that we've made

69
00:03:16.126 --> 00:03:19.106
to the MDM protocol and
configuration profiles

70
00:03:19.396 --> 00:03:22.026
in both iOS and OS
X and I'll point

71
00:03:22.026 --> 00:03:24.366
out the remaining OS
specific differences as we go.

72
00:03:25.206 --> 00:03:28.096
Now that work taken together
alone would be a huge advance,

73
00:03:28.196 --> 00:03:29.286
but we didn't stop there.

74
00:03:29.986 --> 00:03:31.946
We've also made big changes

75
00:03:31.946 --> 00:03:33.746
to the App Store
Volume Purchase Program

76
00:03:34.306 --> 00:03:35.986
and we're introducing
a new service

77
00:03:36.046 --> 00:03:39.076
that makes it much easier
to get devices enrolled

78
00:03:39.076 --> 00:03:42.466
in the MDM server solution that
the organization is deploying.

79
00:03:43.066 --> 00:03:46.556
Now, this session is primarily
targeted at developers

80
00:03:46.556 --> 00:03:49.376
that are creating MDM and other
device management solutions.

81
00:03:50.376 --> 00:03:53.486
Because we've done a lot of
work already, but we really rely

82
00:03:53.486 --> 00:03:55.646
on you just as with the 1500

83
00:03:55.646 --> 00:03:57.546
and more APIs we've
introduced this week

84
00:03:58.346 --> 00:04:00.796
to fully take advantage of these
new capabilities we're offering

85
00:03:58.346 --> 00:04:00.796
to fully take advantage of these
new capabilities we're offering

86
00:04:00.796 --> 00:04:02.786
to you to make the experience

87
00:04:02.786 --> 00:04:04.616
of our joint customers
much greater.

88
00:04:05.576 --> 00:04:07.246
But of course it will
also be of interest

89
00:04:07.246 --> 00:04:10.646
to anyone who's managing large
numbers of Apple devices as well

90
00:04:10.646 --> 00:04:13.046
as app developers who want
to make their app attractive

91
00:04:13.046 --> 00:04:15.926
to education and enterprise
customers who are buying

92
00:04:15.926 --> 00:04:17.935
and deploying large
numbers of Apple devices

93
00:04:18.526 --> 00:04:20.966
and may very well be interested
in buying large numbers

94
00:04:20.966 --> 00:04:22.256
of copies of your apps.

95
00:04:22.786 --> 00:04:25.146
Now, I'm no marketing executive,
but I think that might be

96
00:04:25.146 --> 00:04:26.646
of interest to some of you.

97
00:04:28.286 --> 00:04:29.316
So let's get started.

98
00:04:31.356 --> 00:04:33.236
Before we get into what's new,

99
00:04:33.426 --> 00:04:35.866
I wanted to just
give a brief recap

100
00:04:35.866 --> 00:04:38.876
about the foundational tools
that Apple provides to those

101
00:04:38.876 --> 00:04:41.256
of you who are building
device management tools

102
00:04:41.256 --> 00:04:42.406
for the Apple ecosystem.

103
00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:46.616
The first of which is our MDM
protocol which you can implement

104
00:04:46.686 --> 00:04:49.376
to be able to over the air
communicate with Apple devices

105
00:04:49.996 --> 00:04:54.376
and get information about that
device, be able to remotely lock

106
00:04:54.376 --> 00:04:57.716
or wipe the device if it's
lost, to be able to install apps

107
00:04:57.776 --> 00:04:59.976
over the air, as well

108
00:04:59.976 --> 00:05:01.806
as installing configuration
profiles.

109
00:04:59.976 --> 00:05:01.806
as installing configuration
profiles.

110
00:05:02.506 --> 00:05:05.036
Now, configuration profiles were
the second foundational tool.

111
00:05:05.076 --> 00:05:08.146
And they are collections
of settings

112
00:05:08.626 --> 00:05:11.646
that can configure things on a
device such as accounts, mail,

113
00:05:11.646 --> 00:05:15.186
context, calendars and so
on, in post restrictions

114
00:05:15.426 --> 00:05:18.586
such as disabling the camera
if this device will be used

115
00:05:18.586 --> 00:05:21.916
in a particularly sensitive
location, to provide access

116
00:05:21.916 --> 00:05:24.126
to services like
networking and printers,

117
00:05:25.126 --> 00:05:28.366
as well as to actually complete
MDM enrollment and establish

118
00:05:28.366 --> 00:05:30.156
that connection back
to the MDM server.

119
00:05:30.946 --> 00:05:33.226
Now, for those of you who
may not have actually solved

120
00:05:33.226 --> 00:05:36.136
that problem of getting devices
enrolled in your MDM solution,

121
00:05:36.416 --> 00:05:37.276
you may be thinking, "Well,

122
00:05:37.316 --> 00:05:38.776
Todd isn't that a
chicken and egg problem?

123
00:05:38.776 --> 00:05:41.526
You've got the MDM protocol
that you need to be established

124
00:05:41.526 --> 00:05:43.046
to deliver the configuration
profile

125
00:05:43.046 --> 00:05:44.566
which establishes
the MDM protocol?"

126
00:05:45.536 --> 00:05:47.206
But in fact, we'll
leave that egg

127
00:05:47.206 --> 00:05:48.306
to hatch later in the session.

128
00:05:48.886 --> 00:05:52.016
So, just to give
you a quick scope

129
00:05:52.016 --> 00:05:56.026
of what change we've introduced
in these new OS releases,

130
00:05:56.656 --> 00:05:57.936
I'm only going to
highlight a few of these

131
00:05:57.936 --> 00:05:59.086
and talk about them in detail.

132
00:05:59.286 --> 00:06:01.736
But this is a huge amount of
work and we're looking forward

133
00:05:59.286 --> 00:06:01.736
But this is a huge amount of
work and we're looking forward

134
00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:04.386
to you integrating
these new capabilities

135
00:06:04.386 --> 00:06:06.756
into your device
management solutions.

136
00:06:07.266 --> 00:06:12.876
And I'm going to talk in some
detail about five of them.

137
00:06:13.336 --> 00:06:16.776
The first four are
primarily of interest

138
00:06:16.896 --> 00:06:18.196
to enterprise deployments.

139
00:06:18.616 --> 00:06:21.626
But I think the fifth one will
be compelling for both education

140
00:06:21.626 --> 00:06:24.656
and enterprise customers
that are installing Apple TVs

141
00:06:24.656 --> 00:06:26.726
in their conference
and classrooms.

142
00:06:27.966 --> 00:06:29.406
But before I get
into the details,

143
00:06:29.706 --> 00:06:32.546
I want to spend the moment
talking about a problem

144
00:06:32.546 --> 00:06:34.436
that the mobile device
industry is facing.

145
00:06:34.516 --> 00:06:39.656
And that is how to keep separate
the user's personal private data

146
00:06:40.456 --> 00:06:43.846
and the company's secure data.

147
00:06:44.966 --> 00:06:48.166
Now, some in the industry
seemed to have concluded

148
00:06:48.166 --> 00:06:49.806
that the answer is
dual personas.

149
00:06:50.966 --> 00:06:52.246
That the user should have

150
00:06:52.246 --> 00:06:54.346
to decide whether
they're using their device

151
00:06:54.606 --> 00:06:57.676
as their personal device with
access to their own private data

152
00:06:58.406 --> 00:07:01.476
or they're using it as their
company's device with access

153
00:06:58.406 --> 00:07:01.476
or they're using it as their
company's device with access

154
00:07:01.476 --> 00:07:02.546
to the corporate secure data.

155
00:07:03.896 --> 00:07:05.496
We don't think this
is the right approach.

156
00:07:06.286 --> 00:07:08.496
We think that place is the
burden on the employee to make

157
00:07:08.496 --> 00:07:10.476
that decision and
that's not how you--

158
00:07:10.716 --> 00:07:12.166
people are using their devices.

159
00:07:13.126 --> 00:07:15.506
We think the solution
needs to separate the data

160
00:07:15.916 --> 00:07:17.736
without creating
separate workspaces.

161
00:07:18.416 --> 00:07:22.436
And so, the features I'm going
to talk about now are part

162
00:07:22.436 --> 00:07:25.236
of that solution and are focused

163
00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:29.996
on keeping the user's personal
data protected and private

164
00:07:29.996 --> 00:07:32.806
and the corporate data
protected and secure.

165
00:07:33.406 --> 00:07:38.106
So the first feature I want to
talk about is very much in part

166
00:07:38.106 --> 00:07:40.556
of that solution and
it's Manage Apps on iOS.

167
00:07:41.356 --> 00:07:43.256
Now, this is not a
new feature in iOS 7.

168
00:07:44.076 --> 00:07:47.326
What you can do previously
is install apps via MDM

169
00:07:47.406 --> 00:07:51.036
on an iOS device and because the
organization has installed those

170
00:07:51.036 --> 00:07:53.436
apps on that device, they
have additional rights

171
00:07:53.436 --> 00:07:56.136
over those devices--
over those apps

172
00:07:56.296 --> 00:07:58.446
and can therefore have
more control over the data

173
00:07:58.446 --> 00:08:00.556
to prevent their secure
data leaking out in ways

174
00:07:58.446 --> 00:08:00.556
to prevent their secure
data leaking out in ways

175
00:08:00.556 --> 00:08:03.506
that they don't want including
being able to delete that app

176
00:08:03.506 --> 00:08:05.856
and its data and
prevent that apps data

177
00:08:05.856 --> 00:08:07.176
from being backed up to iCloud.

178
00:08:08.336 --> 00:08:13.146
In iOS 7, writing a number
of new capabilities including

179
00:08:13.146 --> 00:08:16.056
on supervise devices, and
that little guy there is going

180
00:08:16.056 --> 00:08:18.126
to indicate that
particular setting

181
00:08:18.126 --> 00:08:21.006
or capability is only available
on supervised iOS devices

182
00:08:21.156 --> 00:08:24.016
through out this session,
that apps can be installed

183
00:08:24.016 --> 00:08:26.426
without user interaction on
supervised devices [applause].

184
00:08:31.766 --> 00:08:33.416
I'm glad you like that
but there's way more.

185
00:08:33.696 --> 00:08:37.366
And it's also possible
to configure device--

186
00:08:37.366 --> 00:08:40.296
configure apps over the
air to provide the defaults

187
00:08:40.296 --> 00:08:42.086
to change their behavior
once they're installed

188
00:08:42.086 --> 00:08:42.846
on the device [applause].

189
00:08:47.256 --> 00:08:48.256
I agree, it's really cool.

190
00:08:48.856 --> 00:08:51.016
But we also have
the opposite of that

191
00:08:51.016 --> 00:08:54.366
where using the MDM protocol,
you can then pull data back

192
00:08:54.576 --> 00:08:58.126
from the app that has been
stored in the App Sandbox back

193
00:08:58.166 --> 00:09:00.416
to the MDM server to provide
to the organization [applause].

194
00:08:58.166 --> 00:09:00.416
to the MDM server to provide
to the organization [applause].

195
00:09:04.486 --> 00:09:07.236
And then finally, this one
again is a big part of how--

196
00:09:07.276 --> 00:09:10.666
of keeping that data separate
is Managed Open In [applause].

197
00:09:14.996 --> 00:09:16.386
Apparently, you all
know what that means.

198
00:09:17.636 --> 00:09:19.996
What that means is that the
organization can have greater

199
00:09:19.996 --> 00:09:22.366
control over how their
users open documents

200
00:09:22.366 --> 00:09:23.976
in Managed Apps and Accounts.

201
00:09:24.376 --> 00:09:26.786
They can restrict the
list of apps that appear

202
00:09:27.096 --> 00:09:29.956
in the Share Sheet thereby
keeping better control

203
00:09:29.956 --> 00:09:31.896
over that data and again,
preventing it from leaking

204
00:09:31.896 --> 00:09:34.066
out in ways that
they don't want.

205
00:09:36.316 --> 00:09:39.346
The next feature I want to talk
about is called Single Sign On,

206
00:09:39.596 --> 00:09:41.056
and this is really
building on some

207
00:09:41.056 --> 00:09:43.746
of the concepts we introduced
in iOS 6 with the integration

208
00:09:43.746 --> 00:09:46.196
of the Twitter and Facebook
credentials that are--

209
00:09:46.196 --> 00:09:47.576
can be used in multiple apps.

210
00:09:47.936 --> 00:09:50.136
We've now generalized
that to be able to be used

211
00:09:50.136 --> 00:09:53.336
across the system where a set
of credentials can be stored

212
00:09:53.336 --> 00:09:55.666
in one place provided
by configuration profile

213
00:09:55.666 --> 00:09:58.696
and then used by multiple
apps for authentication.

214
00:10:00.456 --> 00:10:02.726
This, we think, will be
great for app developers

215
00:10:02.726 --> 00:10:05.206
to help them solve the
authentication problem

216
00:10:05.586 --> 00:10:07.596
and help get their apps
adopted more wildly.

217
00:10:08.276 --> 00:10:10.466
It takes the form
of a new payload

218
00:10:10.466 --> 00:10:13.326
that provides the credentials,
as well as optionally a set

219
00:10:13.366 --> 00:10:17.386
of URL prefixes where, if a
user goes to one of those URLs,

220
00:10:17.386 --> 00:10:19.646
those credentials can be
used for authentication,

221
00:10:20.446 --> 00:10:22.836
or in addition, they
can also provide a list

222
00:10:22.836 --> 00:10:25.436
of app identifiers that are
for apps that are allowed

223
00:10:25.436 --> 00:10:27.286
to use these credentials
for authentication.

224
00:10:27.646 --> 00:10:31.906
Next, we move on to
one of the features

225
00:10:31.906 --> 00:10:33.446
that Craig briefly
mentioned yesterday

226
00:10:33.446 --> 00:10:36.046
and there's one brief shoutout
of excitement about that,

227
00:10:36.046 --> 00:10:38.036
hopefully more of you are
excited about Per-App VPN

228
00:10:38.606 --> 00:10:40.716
because this is another big
piece of the puzzle of how

229
00:10:40.716 --> 00:10:42.506
to solve that data
separation problem.

230
00:10:43.796 --> 00:10:47.296
Per-App VPN allows organizations
to more narrowly focus

231
00:10:47.686 --> 00:10:50.906
which apps are going to use the
secure and private network back

232
00:10:51.016 --> 00:10:53.236
to their remote services
at their company.

233
00:10:54.276 --> 00:10:55.696
What this means is that instead

234
00:10:55.696 --> 00:10:57.826
of having the VPN
cover the entire system

235
00:10:57.826 --> 00:11:00.216
and have all data go
through that private network,

236
00:10:57.826 --> 00:11:00.216
and have all data go
through that private network,

237
00:11:00.646 --> 00:11:02.416
only the corporate
secure data will go

238
00:11:02.416 --> 00:11:05.526
through the secure network, the
users private data does not.

239
00:11:06.246 --> 00:11:09.086
So, this is better for both the
organization and the end user.

240
00:11:09.086 --> 00:11:11.656
And there's one additional
detail for those of you

241
00:11:11.656 --> 00:11:15.396
who are going to be implementing
this is that on iOS,

242
00:11:15.396 --> 00:11:17.466
the Managed App needs
to be configured

243
00:11:17.466 --> 00:11:19.496
to use Per-App VPN
when it's installed.

244
00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:24.216
If you didn't notice one
more detail about that,

245
00:11:24.216 --> 00:11:26.386
since it didn't have the iOS
badge up there when they cleared

246
00:11:26.386 --> 00:11:29.436
that Per-App VPN, is
available on both OS X and iOS.

247
00:11:30.686 --> 00:11:33.176
Now, moving on to an
OS X specific feature,

248
00:11:33.266 --> 00:11:35.206
FileVault of course is not new

249
00:11:35.206 --> 00:11:37.246
and even managing
FileVault is not new,

250
00:11:37.246 --> 00:11:40.626
but we've added a great
number of new capabilities

251
00:11:40.626 --> 00:11:44.436
that you can now manage
remotely for OS X systems

252
00:11:44.436 --> 00:11:47.566
that are using FileVault,
including querying the status

253
00:11:47.566 --> 00:11:50.716
of whether FileVault is enabled,
as well as preventing users

254
00:11:50.716 --> 00:11:52.736
from disabling FileVault
once it's been enabled.

255
00:11:53.186 --> 00:11:58.456
During the process of
enabling FileVault,

256
00:11:58.456 --> 00:12:00.216
an individual recovery
key is generated

257
00:11:58.456 --> 00:12:00.216
an individual recovery
key is generated

258
00:12:00.216 --> 00:12:01.306
and provided to the user.

259
00:12:02.206 --> 00:12:04.556
Instead of that being
sent to Apple for help--

260
00:12:04.736 --> 00:12:08.096
the AppleCare, organizations
can now configure the device

261
00:12:08.096 --> 00:12:11.286
so that key is sent back to the
company instead of to Apple.

262
00:12:12.166 --> 00:12:14.486
They can also add
whatever period of--

263
00:12:14.486 --> 00:12:16.246
periodicity they
feel is appropriate

264
00:12:16.246 --> 00:12:17.436
for their security policies,

265
00:12:17.986 --> 00:12:22.736
they can rotate the
institutional recovery key via

266
00:12:22.736 --> 00:12:22.826
MDM [applause].

267
00:12:23.046 --> 00:12:23.596
Thank you.

268
00:12:23.706 --> 00:12:28.606
All right, we appreciate
your enthusiasm.

269
00:12:29.346 --> 00:12:31.446
All right, moving on
to AirPlay Mirroring.

270
00:12:31.446 --> 00:12:33.466
This is the feature that
I mentioned earlier.

271
00:12:33.466 --> 00:12:35.026
I think it will be
great for both education

272
00:12:35.026 --> 00:12:36.396
and enterprise deployments.

273
00:12:37.606 --> 00:12:41.286
We are adding a new MDM command
that allows the MDM server

274
00:12:41.286 --> 00:12:43.876
to tell a specific device
to begin AirPlay Mirroring

275
00:12:43.876 --> 00:12:45.636
to a specific AirPlay
destination.

276
00:12:46.726 --> 00:12:48.516
We're also providing
a new payload

277
00:12:48.516 --> 00:12:50.736
that allows configuring
a whitelist

278
00:12:50.736 --> 00:12:54.186
of allowed destinations on
supervised devices as well

279
00:12:54.186 --> 00:12:57.206
as pre-configuring passwords
for AirPlay destinations

280
00:12:57.556 --> 00:12:59.666
in the payload so that users
don't have to answer them.

281
00:12:59.956 --> 00:13:03.726
And you can have the Apple TVs
locked down but still not have

282
00:12:59.956 --> 00:13:03.726
And you can have the Apple TVs
locked down but still not have

283
00:13:03.726 --> 00:13:06.256
to have each end user
know what the password is.

284
00:13:08.396 --> 00:13:10.346
I'm also very pleased
to announce

285
00:13:10.516 --> 00:13:13.446
that Apple TVs can now be
enrolled and managed via MDM.

286
00:13:18.126 --> 00:13:18.486
[applause] We agree.

287
00:13:18.486 --> 00:13:20.466
This is very exciting
including querying

288
00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:21.896
and setting the language
in locale

289
00:13:22.226 --> 00:13:24.356
and configuring our
network access including

290
00:13:24.356 --> 00:13:26.446
to protect the 802.1X networks.

291
00:13:26.946 --> 00:13:31.266
But that's just the first couple
that I wanted to highlight,

292
00:13:31.266 --> 00:13:34.576
there's so much more including
the ability to install fonts

293
00:13:34.576 --> 00:13:37.246
on both iOS and OS X via
configuration profile.

294
00:13:37.946 --> 00:13:40.316
We've enhanced the Wi-Fi
payload to add support

295
00:13:40.316 --> 00:13:42.196
for the new Wi-Fi Hotspot 2.0.

296
00:13:42.236 --> 00:13:47.076
On iOS, we're allowing you to
configure AirPrint destinations.

297
00:13:47.766 --> 00:13:50.056
All right, somebody's
using AirPrint?

298
00:13:51.316 --> 00:13:52.626
Single App Mode is not new

299
00:13:52.626 --> 00:13:55.396
but you can now configure a
lot more accessibility options

300
00:13:55.396 --> 00:13:57.026
which we think will
be great in schools

301
00:13:57.026 --> 00:13:59.226
for doing testing
on iOS devices.

302
00:14:00.226 --> 00:14:01.646
We're also providing
a new payload

303
00:14:01.646 --> 00:14:03.486
that provides web
content filtering

304
00:14:03.486 --> 00:14:05.126
on supervised iOS devices.

305
00:14:05.646 --> 00:14:08.906
And a few OS 10 specific
changes,

306
00:14:09.196 --> 00:14:11.436
the exchange web services
payload is not new

307
00:14:11.436 --> 00:14:14.496
but it now supports all
five account types; Context,

308
00:14:14.496 --> 00:14:17.486
Calendars, Email,
Notes and Reminders.

309
00:14:22.586 --> 00:14:24.476
[applause] The passcode policy
of course is not new either,

310
00:14:24.476 --> 00:14:27.086
it's been supported all
along on both iOS and OS X,

311
00:14:27.386 --> 00:14:30.566
but there were a small number
of settings that did not--

312
00:14:30.656 --> 00:14:32.976
were not supported
on OS X and we now

313
00:14:32.976 --> 00:14:36.186
in OS X Mavericks have
complete parody with iOS,

314
00:14:36.286 --> 00:14:37.926
so you're being confident

315
00:14:38.026 --> 00:14:41.526
that your passcode policies
are applied the same way

316
00:14:41.526 --> 00:14:43.246
across both OS's.

317
00:14:44.836 --> 00:14:47.566
There are also, as you can
see, many new restrictions,

318
00:14:47.656 --> 00:14:49.486
the first six there
available only

319
00:14:49.486 --> 00:14:53.276
on supervised devices including
preventing users from creating

320
00:14:53.276 --> 00:14:54.636
or modifying accounts.

321
00:14:54.946 --> 00:14:59.416
Again, another way to
help separate the data

322
00:14:59.416 --> 00:15:02.146
between the users personal data
and the corporate secure data.

323
00:14:59.416 --> 00:15:02.146
between the users personal data
and the corporate secure data.

324
00:15:03.346 --> 00:15:06.346
There's also a new restriction
controlling whether a supervised

325
00:15:06.346 --> 00:15:10.166
devices can pair to other
Macs but I'm going to talk

326
00:15:10.166 --> 00:15:12.446
about that more a bit
later in the session.

327
00:15:14.786 --> 00:15:16.416
Finally, there are a number

328
00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:19.286
of additional enhancements
to the MDM protocol.

329
00:15:19.286 --> 00:15:21.696
I already mentioned one new
command, but there are a number

330
00:15:21.696 --> 00:15:25.636
of new queries where you can
ask the device whether certain

331
00:15:25.636 --> 00:15:27.936
features are enabled
or not; Mobile HotSpot,

332
00:15:27.936 --> 00:15:29.456
Do Not Disturb, Find My iPhone.

333
00:15:29.906 --> 00:15:31.106
And you can also ask the device

334
00:15:31.106 --> 00:15:33.346
if it has an iTunes
account signed in.

335
00:15:34.156 --> 00:15:37.916
In addition to the new command
to begin AirPlay Mirroring

336
00:15:37.916 --> 00:15:41.396
to a destination, you can also
now set a custom lock screen

337
00:15:41.396 --> 00:15:41.646
via MDM.

338
00:15:42.156 --> 00:15:43.686
You can put the device
in lost mode

339
00:15:43.686 --> 00:15:46.076
which adds contact
information to the lock screen,

340
00:15:46.076 --> 00:15:47.836
so that if somebody
finds your lost device,

341
00:15:47.836 --> 00:15:48.776
they can get it back to you.

342
00:15:49.336 --> 00:15:52.306
And you can also disable
the Personal Hotspot.

343
00:15:52.846 --> 00:15:58.206
So, that's a lot of work and
lot of talking by me and I now

344
00:15:58.206 --> 00:15:59.816
like to ask Jussi
and Chris to come up

345
00:16:00.136 --> 00:16:02.306
and show off those new managed
app enhancements that you were

346
00:16:02.306 --> 00:16:04.056
so excited about and
they are really cool.

347
00:16:04.106 --> 00:16:04.936
So, guys take it away.

348
00:16:05.516 --> 00:16:10.636
[ Applause ]

349
00:16:11.136 --> 00:16:12.236
>> Jussi: All right,
thank you Todd.

350
00:16:12.766 --> 00:16:13.906
So, first I'm going
to show you some

351
00:16:13.906 --> 00:16:15.876
of the new management
features for Managed Apps.

352
00:16:16.246 --> 00:16:18.486
So, Todd mentioned
managed configuration

353
00:16:18.486 --> 00:16:21.286
and managed feedback for
managed applications.

354
00:16:21.286 --> 00:16:24.706
So, here I have a sample
application that seems

355
00:16:24.706 --> 00:16:26.876
to be stuck in time
back in 1993.

356
00:16:26.876 --> 00:16:28.816
If anybody remember or
saw San Jose Conferences,

357
00:16:29.036 --> 00:16:30.866
can you raise your hand?

358
00:16:30.866 --> 00:16:32.226
[applause] Oh, thank
you for coming back

359
00:16:32.226 --> 00:16:33.056
and sticking with the platform.

360
00:16:33.056 --> 00:16:35.136
So, this used to be Newton
App, if you remember,

361
00:16:35.136 --> 00:16:38.756
and we can update it to some
modern conference location.

362
00:16:38.756 --> 00:16:41.076
So, if Chris is now
sending an app update,

363
00:16:41.076 --> 00:16:43.656
so you notice right now
we're in San Francisco,

364
00:16:43.656 --> 00:16:44.896
we just came back to the future.

365
00:16:45.196 --> 00:16:46.276
And what just happened is

366
00:16:46.276 --> 00:16:49.096
that there was an application
configuration payload

367
00:16:49.536 --> 00:16:53.586
that was sent over MDM, so this
app got an instantaneous update

368
00:16:53.586 --> 00:16:57.036
of a Push Notification and
as an application developer,

369
00:16:57.306 --> 00:17:00.006
you want to think of what
kind of settings would you

370
00:16:57.306 --> 00:17:00.006
you want to think of what
kind of settings would you

371
00:17:00.006 --> 00:17:01.686
like to implement
as live updates?

372
00:17:01.766 --> 00:17:04.016
This is effectively
life preferences

373
00:17:04.016 --> 00:17:05.026
for some app settings.

374
00:17:05.126 --> 00:17:07.906
And as an MDM vendor, you'd
want to implement the method

375
00:17:07.906 --> 00:17:10.496
for sending these
application-specific payloads--

376
00:17:10.536 --> 00:17:12.526
configuration payloads
that they're not--

377
00:17:12.526 --> 00:17:14.376
the developer has
taken advantage of.

378
00:17:14.965 --> 00:17:16.886
So, that's all fine and great

379
00:17:16.886 --> 00:17:19.476
but then we also have
a support for feedback.

380
00:17:19.476 --> 00:17:21.236
So, gathering feedback
from the application

381
00:17:21.776 --> 00:17:25.046
and this is an awesome
conference if I could type that,

382
00:17:25.396 --> 00:17:26.435
[inaudible] conference.

383
00:17:26.566 --> 00:17:28.976
No, let's try that again.

384
00:17:29.516 --> 00:17:33.536
[ Pause ]

385
00:17:34.036 --> 00:17:36.096
Also in conference again.

386
00:17:36.656 --> 00:17:38.956
And now, Chris is going
to send an MDM command.

387
00:17:39.456 --> 00:17:42.016
Again, another command that MDM
vendors will want to implement

388
00:17:42.586 --> 00:17:46.326
and let's see how that
output looks on the Console.

389
00:17:47.096 --> 00:17:49.696
So, here we have a feedback
dictionary that's returned

390
00:17:49.696 --> 00:17:51.966
over the MDM protocol
to the MDM server.

391
00:17:52.346 --> 00:17:54.036
So, as an MDM vendor, given

392
00:17:54.036 --> 00:17:56.276
that there's probably
several thousand applications

393
00:17:56.276 --> 00:17:58.266
that will have managed
configuration preferences,

394
00:17:58.576 --> 00:17:59.936
you will not necessarily
have able--

395
00:18:00.156 --> 00:18:00.926
you will not be able

396
00:18:00.926 --> 00:18:03.796
to implement a [inaudible]
mechanism or--

397
00:18:03.796 --> 00:18:06.016
and reporting mechanism
for each every app.

398
00:18:06.016 --> 00:18:08.056
So, what you want to do
is provide mechanisms

399
00:18:08.056 --> 00:18:10.976
for this feedback data
that we gathered and stored

400
00:18:10.976 --> 00:18:12.256
and then further process

401
00:18:12.326 --> 00:18:14.376
by a site-specific
application or Backend.

402
00:18:14.666 --> 00:18:17.816
So, you act as a conduit
for gathering feedback

403
00:18:17.816 --> 00:18:19.836
from the application
and then delivering it

404
00:18:19.836 --> 00:18:22.746
to some other application that
will then process it further.

405
00:18:23.236 --> 00:18:25.776
So, that's a quick
overview of the App Feedback

406
00:18:25.776 --> 00:18:27.886
and App Managed Preferences.

407
00:18:28.146 --> 00:18:30.346
If you want to know more
about these specific features,

408
00:18:30.616 --> 00:18:33.966
there's a session today at
3:15 regarding Extending Your

409
00:18:33.966 --> 00:18:35.976
Applications for
Education and Enterprise use

410
00:18:36.276 --> 00:18:38.376
and there'll be more information

411
00:18:38.376 --> 00:18:40.036
about these specific
things there.

412
00:18:40.436 --> 00:18:44.196
So, the next thing is Managed
Open In back to default.

413
00:18:44.446 --> 00:18:45.826
So, enterprises.

414
00:18:45.826 --> 00:18:51.306
So, we have apparently some
mail here and this seems

415
00:18:51.306 --> 00:18:53.226
to be the new iOS
Enterprise Deployment Guide,

416
00:18:53.736 --> 00:18:55.506
and that's great.

417
00:18:56.006 --> 00:18:58.336
So, let's see if we can
send this over to somebody

418
00:18:58.336 --> 00:19:02.126
that has a Dropbox
account or whatnot.

419
00:18:58.336 --> 00:19:02.126
that has a Dropbox
account or whatnot.

420
00:19:02.126 --> 00:19:03.496
But that's not necessarily
ideal.

421
00:19:03.496 --> 00:19:05.766
This is a draft document,
not to be shared.

422
00:19:06.046 --> 00:19:09.006
So, I need to be able to
lock this account down

423
00:19:09.006 --> 00:19:12.696
and restrict the ability of
this document to be shared.

424
00:19:13.066 --> 00:19:17.086
So, with Managed Open In,
this mail account is managed.

425
00:19:17.336 --> 00:19:20.396
So, my MDM payload
configured this account.

426
00:19:20.746 --> 00:19:22.566
I also installed
some applications

427
00:19:22.566 --> 00:19:23.876
as Managed Applications.

428
00:19:24.196 --> 00:19:27.606
So, Chris is now going to
send a configuration profile

429
00:19:27.606 --> 00:19:30.796
that restricts my ability
to open the document

430
00:19:30.796 --> 00:19:33.126
in any other application
besides the ones

431
00:19:33.126 --> 00:19:34.696
that the administrator
has chosen

432
00:19:34.886 --> 00:19:35.856
for this app to be opened.

433
00:19:35.856 --> 00:19:39.256
And you'll notice that
I just lost Dropbox,

434
00:19:39.256 --> 00:19:42.846
I lost Google Drive, I only
have GoodReader as an option

435
00:19:42.846 --> 00:19:43.796
to open this document in.

436
00:19:44.106 --> 00:19:45.626
So, this is basically a way

437
00:19:45.626 --> 00:19:50.076
of compartmentalizing
your application data

438
00:19:50.076 --> 00:19:52.706
and your user data without
compromising the iOS

439
00:19:52.706 --> 00:19:53.416
user experience.

440
00:19:53.416 --> 00:19:53.526
So--

441
00:19:54.516 --> 00:19:59.996
[ Applause ]

442
00:20:00.496 --> 00:20:03.496
So, that's Managed Open
In, and now back to Todd.

443
00:20:04.286 --> 00:20:05.506
>> Todd Fernandez: All right,
thank you very much guys.

444
00:20:06.276 --> 00:20:08.656
All right, so that's
already a lot of change

445
00:20:08.736 --> 00:20:09.826
but we're just getting started.

446
00:20:11.266 --> 00:20:12.126
Now, I'd like to talk to you

447
00:20:12.126 --> 00:20:13.866
about the App Store
Volume Purchase Program.

448
00:20:14.496 --> 00:20:17.326
Many of you may be aware
of this already, but today,

449
00:20:18.156 --> 00:20:21.276
education enterprise
organizations can purchase app

450
00:20:21.456 --> 00:20:23.616
and education books
codes in bulk.

451
00:20:24.446 --> 00:20:27.896
The App Store or B2B
Store and MDM vendors many

452
00:20:27.896 --> 00:20:30.346
of which have integrated code
management and distribution

453
00:20:30.346 --> 00:20:32.836
into their MDM solutions
to enable organizations

454
00:20:33.276 --> 00:20:35.906
to install those apps on
their end user systems.

455
00:20:36.376 --> 00:20:40.366
But of course, this involves
managing spreadsheets

456
00:20:40.426 --> 00:20:43.566
of redemption codes and
nobody really likes that,

457
00:20:44.466 --> 00:20:46.406
for two reasons,
one, it's very clumsy

458
00:20:46.406 --> 00:20:49.296
but more importantly it
involves a permanent transfer

459
00:20:49.296 --> 00:20:52.026
of ownership of that
asset to the end user.

460
00:20:52.266 --> 00:20:54.006
So, I'm very pleased to announce

461
00:20:54.456 --> 00:20:58.006
that we are allowing
organizations

462
00:20:58.006 --> 00:21:00.416
to purchase licenses
that are revocable

463
00:20:58.006 --> 00:21:00.416
to purchase licenses
that are revocable

464
00:21:00.416 --> 00:21:08.306
for apps instead of codes.

465
00:21:08.456 --> 00:21:09.306
[applause] But that's not all.

466
00:21:09.956 --> 00:21:11.286
We're adding Mac Apps
as well [applause].

467
00:21:15.566 --> 00:21:18.686
We're adding books
for enterprise and--

468
00:21:19.796 --> 00:21:21.146
all right fine, nobody wants

469
00:21:21.146 --> 00:21:24.016
to read technical
manuals, I get it.

470
00:21:24.426 --> 00:21:27.636
But even better for those of you
who are working on MDM products,

471
00:21:27.906 --> 00:21:30.196
we're going to provide a
rich set of Web Services APIs

472
00:21:30.196 --> 00:21:32.626
to allow you to fully
integrate this new system

473
00:21:32.626 --> 00:21:34.756
into your products and
give a great experience

474
00:21:34.756 --> 00:21:35.486
to our customers.

475
00:21:39.766 --> 00:21:41.386
[applause] So, let's talk
about how this system is going

476
00:21:41.386 --> 00:21:42.866
to work starting of course

477
00:21:42.866 --> 00:21:44.756
with what the end
user will experience.

478
00:21:45.496 --> 00:21:46.946
Once an assignment of one

479
00:21:46.946 --> 00:21:49.396
of these revocable
licenses has been made,

480
00:21:49.636 --> 00:21:52.196
the assigned app appears in
the user's purchase list just

481
00:21:52.196 --> 00:21:53.686
as if they purchased
it themselves.

482
00:21:54.176 --> 00:21:55.566
And that's great
for self-service,

483
00:21:55.566 --> 00:21:57.066
they can then tap
it to download it.

484
00:21:57.736 --> 00:21:59.636
But we are also providing
an MDM command

485
00:21:59.636 --> 00:22:02.526
that allows the organization
to tell the device to install

486
00:21:59.636 --> 00:22:02.526
that allows the organization
to tell the device to install

487
00:22:02.566 --> 00:22:04.656
that app, which will
then be a managed app

488
00:22:04.656 --> 00:22:08.866
on iOS allowing enterprises
to get the right apps

489
00:22:08.866 --> 00:22:12.116
on their employees' devices,
allowing schools to make sure

490
00:22:12.116 --> 00:22:15.096
that the students have the
apps that they need to learn

491
00:22:15.096 --> 00:22:16.896
and not be taking up class time.

492
00:22:17.676 --> 00:22:18.686
So that's great.

493
00:22:18.686 --> 00:22:20.336
That's how to get the
apps on the devices.

494
00:22:20.986 --> 00:22:23.046
What about revoking a license

495
00:22:23.046 --> 00:22:26.886
when an employee leaves their
job or student graduates?

496
00:22:27.386 --> 00:22:29.836
Well, when the command
to revoke that license

497
00:22:29.836 --> 00:22:31.776
from that particular user
is sent to the store,

498
00:22:32.576 --> 00:22:34.026
that app will just
no longer appear

499
00:22:34.026 --> 00:22:35.226
in that user's Purchased list.

500
00:22:35.776 --> 00:22:37.936
That of course means that
it can no longer be updated

501
00:22:38.186 --> 00:22:40.606
or redownloaded on
additional devices that has

502
00:22:40.606 --> 00:22:42.276
that same iTunes
account logged in.

503
00:22:43.396 --> 00:22:47.186
This will be notified that that
app has been revoked and prompt

504
00:22:47.186 --> 00:22:48.856
to buy, which I'm
sure will make those

505
00:22:48.926 --> 00:22:51.416
of you app developers happy
to buy their own copy.

506
00:22:52.526 --> 00:22:55.546
Now, because the security model
is different on iOS from OS X,

507
00:22:55.546 --> 00:22:56.806
there are some differences

508
00:22:56.806 --> 00:22:59.656
in exactly how the Apple
behaves once it's been revoked.

509
00:23:00.356 --> 00:23:03.786
On iOS, because apps are not
allowed to exit themselves,

510
00:23:04.406 --> 00:23:07.566
the OS itself will enforce
that if the app will not launch

511
00:23:07.566 --> 00:23:10.436
after a 30-day grace period
allowing the user time

512
00:23:10.436 --> 00:23:11.476
to purchase their own copy.

513
00:23:12.826 --> 00:23:16.136
On OS X, the app will
need to check the receipt

514
00:23:16.136 --> 00:23:19.046
and once the receipt has
expired after that grace period,

515
00:23:19.046 --> 00:23:20.566
the app can then quit on launch.

516
00:23:20.886 --> 00:23:23.406
And for those of you
OS X app developers not

517
00:23:23.406 --> 00:23:26.106
yet checking receipts, there's
a session later this week

518
00:23:26.106 --> 00:23:26.946
that will teach you how to do it

519
00:23:26.946 --> 00:23:28.826
and I will give you
all the details

520
00:23:28.826 --> 00:23:29.716
at the end of this session.

521
00:23:30.256 --> 00:23:34.466
All right, so that's
the end user experience.

522
00:23:34.896 --> 00:23:38.476
Now, let's talk about what the
MDM product developers will need

523
00:23:38.476 --> 00:23:39.876
to do to support
this new system.

524
00:23:40.346 --> 00:23:43.296
And it really breaks down to
three areas of functionality.

525
00:23:43.816 --> 00:23:46.516
First, authenticating this
organization's account

526
00:23:46.606 --> 00:23:48.296
with the Volume Purchase
Program,

527
00:23:49.986 --> 00:23:53.066
sending a user an invitation
to link their Apple ID

528
00:23:53.066 --> 00:23:55.026
to your organization
and I'll talk much more

529
00:23:55.026 --> 00:23:55.816
about that in a moment.

530
00:23:56.016 --> 00:23:57.626
And then of course the
heart of the matter,

531
00:23:57.906 --> 00:24:00.766
being able to assign licenses,
to be able to revoke them

532
00:23:57.906 --> 00:24:00.766
being able to assign licenses,
to be able to revoke them

533
00:24:00.976 --> 00:24:02.566
and then assign into
some other user.

534
00:24:03.146 --> 00:24:05.726
So let's talk about
each one in turn.

535
00:24:07.136 --> 00:24:09.936
The organization will
obtain a secure token

536
00:24:10.086 --> 00:24:12.136
from the VPP website
where they're going

537
00:24:12.136 --> 00:24:14.096
to purchase their
content in bulk.

538
00:24:15.306 --> 00:24:17.106
This works great because
then you don't have

539
00:24:17.106 --> 00:24:18.966
to store their credentials
for them, you just need

540
00:24:18.966 --> 00:24:21.476
to provide URI for them
to enter their token.

541
00:24:22.086 --> 00:24:24.846
It's relatively long-lived
but will currently plan

542
00:24:24.846 --> 00:24:26.096
to expire after a year.

543
00:24:26.246 --> 00:24:27.456
So, it is something
that they will have

544
00:24:27.456 --> 00:24:29.416
to do periodically
but not frequently.

545
00:24:31.626 --> 00:24:33.026
Now, user invitations.

546
00:24:33.366 --> 00:24:35.476
This is a really
important part of the system

547
00:24:35.476 --> 00:24:36.866
that preserves user privacy.

548
00:24:38.156 --> 00:24:41.186
We don't want to force users to
reveal their private Apple ID

549
00:24:41.256 --> 00:24:43.246
to the organization or
the school that's going

550
00:24:43.246 --> 00:24:44.886
to provide them with
this content.

551
00:24:45.726 --> 00:24:48.346
So there's a one-time
process to link their Apple ID

552
00:24:48.346 --> 00:24:51.376
with the organization providing
content in the iTunes Store.

553
00:24:52.676 --> 00:24:56.666
The MDM server will request
an individual URL for the user

554
00:24:56.666 --> 00:25:00.736
that they are tracking in their
system and then be able to use

555
00:24:56.666 --> 00:25:00.736
that they are tracking in their
system and then be able to use

556
00:25:00.736 --> 00:25:02.446
that URL to construct
an invitation

557
00:25:02.446 --> 00:25:05.436
and they can send it via
email, construct a web portal,

558
00:25:05.746 --> 00:25:08.686
or send it over MDM, which
we think is the best approach

559
00:25:08.686 --> 00:25:10.556
if the user has a
device enrolled

560
00:25:10.936 --> 00:25:14.436
that the MDM server knows about
and we'll show that later on.

561
00:25:15.616 --> 00:25:18.046
Finally, the process

562
00:25:18.046 --> 00:25:19.536
of the assigning license
couldn't be easier.

563
00:25:19.866 --> 00:25:22.056
The MDM server can--
once it's authenticated,

564
00:25:22.056 --> 00:25:25.476
the account with the iTunes
Store can request the list

565
00:25:25.476 --> 00:25:28.236
of app and book purchases
that organization has made.

566
00:25:29.206 --> 00:25:31.566
They can send request to
say assign this list of apps

567
00:25:31.566 --> 00:25:33.116
and books to these
lists of users.

568
00:25:34.486 --> 00:25:37.626
And then, if desired,
that's already sufficient

569
00:25:37.626 --> 00:25:40.006
to get the content out to
those users, but if they want

570
00:25:40.006 --> 00:25:42.816
to tell the device to
install the app on the device,

571
00:25:43.236 --> 00:25:45.446
they can send the
MDM command out.

572
00:25:46.666 --> 00:25:48.576
Revocations are the opposite.

573
00:25:48.606 --> 00:25:51.486
They can send a list of
revoked licenses for this app

574
00:25:52.676 --> 00:25:54.406
from these lists of users.

575
00:25:55.406 --> 00:25:59.536
However, book assignments
just like code based model,

576
00:25:59.536 --> 00:26:02.226
it's still permanent, a
transfer of ownership.

577
00:25:59.536 --> 00:26:02.226
it's still permanent, a
transfer of ownership.

578
00:26:02.616 --> 00:26:04.706
We decide to add that
to the new system

579
00:26:04.706 --> 00:26:07.446
because that will enable
MDM providers as well

580
00:26:07.446 --> 00:26:10.006
as organizations to use the
same system to manage both types

581
00:26:10.006 --> 00:26:12.296
of content, but for
now at least,

582
00:26:12.606 --> 00:26:13.846
book assignments are permanent.

583
00:26:14.356 --> 00:26:17.296
All right, let me
give you a short--

584
00:26:17.386 --> 00:26:19.246
walk you through a short
architecture diagram

585
00:26:19.246 --> 00:26:20.466
to give you another
way of thinking

586
00:26:20.466 --> 00:26:21.706
about the way the system works.

587
00:26:22.396 --> 00:26:24.926
Each organization will go
to the [inaudible] website

588
00:26:24.926 --> 00:26:27.256
and purchase whatever
app and book licenses

589
00:26:27.256 --> 00:26:28.106
that they wish to have.

590
00:26:28.826 --> 00:26:30.826
That information flows
into the iTunes Store.

591
00:26:32.206 --> 00:26:35.496
The MDM server can query the
iTunes Store for those licenses

592
00:26:36.086 --> 00:26:38.686
and then send up requests
to make assignments.

593
00:26:39.236 --> 00:26:42.646
Once that's been done, the
device can check in with the--

594
00:26:42.756 --> 00:26:44.036
the device will be notified

595
00:26:44.166 --> 00:26:47.566
to pull its Purchased
list and update its UI.

596
00:26:48.336 --> 00:26:51.246
At that time, again, the user
can freely download those

597
00:26:51.246 --> 00:26:56.336
assigned apps and books or the
MDM server can send the command

598
00:26:56.466 --> 00:27:00.396
down to the device to tell it
to download particular book

599
00:26:56.466 --> 00:27:00.396
down to the device to tell it
to download particular book

600
00:27:00.396 --> 00:27:03.006
or books-- sorry,
particular app or apps.

601
00:27:04.176 --> 00:27:07.146
All right, so let's get down
another level into details

602
00:27:07.146 --> 00:27:09.456
of how these APIs will work
and how you'll use them.

603
00:27:10.716 --> 00:27:12.816
There's a common URL prefix

604
00:27:12.876 --> 00:27:14.936
that then you'll append
the specific service

605
00:27:14.936 --> 00:27:15.846
that you want to use.

606
00:27:16.536 --> 00:27:20.056
Now, the various tips and
advice that I will pass along

607
00:27:20.266 --> 00:27:21.896
through the remainder of
this section of the session.

608
00:27:22.486 --> 00:27:25.306
One-- Important one is not the
hard code, those service URLs.

609
00:27:25.306 --> 00:27:27.886
They may change over
time but the ser--

610
00:27:27.886 --> 00:27:30.616
the VPPServiceConfigSrv
will always be able

611
00:27:30.616 --> 00:27:32.566
to provide you the
latest service URLs.

612
00:27:33.936 --> 00:27:38.156
You'll provide the parameters to
these services as JSON strings

613
00:27:38.966 --> 00:27:40.456
and the secure token

614
00:27:40.456 --> 00:27:42.476
that I mentioned
earlier will be provided

615
00:27:42.476 --> 00:27:44.736
with all service requests
to authenticate the call.

616
00:27:45.266 --> 00:27:49.406
What you'll get back
is also in JSON format.

617
00:27:50.136 --> 00:27:52.036
If there are any fields
that don't have a value,

618
00:27:52.236 --> 00:27:53.416
those will not be included.

619
00:27:54.076 --> 00:27:56.496
And, if for some strange
reason there's an error,

620
00:27:56.566 --> 00:28:00.716
you'll get both an ErrorNumber
and user readable ErrorMessage

621
00:27:56.566 --> 00:28:00.716
you'll get both an ErrorNumber
and user readable ErrorMessage

622
00:28:00.716 --> 00:28:04.716
that you can provide
in your UI to the user.

623
00:28:04.716 --> 00:28:05.726
I want to clarify that.

624
00:28:05.726 --> 00:28:08.286
An ErrorMessage will map
back to a single ErrorNumber,

625
00:28:08.286 --> 00:28:10.756
unique ErrorNumber but each
ErrorNumber may represent a

626
00:28:10.756 --> 00:28:13.226
number of different user
visible ErrorMessages.

627
00:28:13.556 --> 00:28:17.556
And just to give you an
idea of the kinds of errors

628
00:28:17.556 --> 00:28:20.086
that may happen, of course,
they'll never be any errors

629
00:28:20.116 --> 00:28:21.986
but you probably should
handle them anyway.

630
00:28:23.836 --> 00:28:26.276
All right, now let me walk
you through a specific example

631
00:28:26.276 --> 00:28:27.876
of how you would use
one of the services

632
00:28:27.916 --> 00:28:29.316
and this service is the one

633
00:28:29.316 --> 00:28:31.626
where you actually
associate a particular license

634
00:28:31.656 --> 00:28:34.076
with a particular user
effectively assigning it

635
00:28:34.816 --> 00:28:36.016
to them.

636
00:28:36.206 --> 00:28:38.616
Provide some information
including the secure token,

637
00:28:39.366 --> 00:28:42.536
call the service, and then the
response might look something

638
00:28:42.536 --> 00:28:44.746
like this where you get
some additional details

639
00:28:44.746 --> 00:28:47.196
about the license that's been
assigned including its ID,

640
00:28:47.646 --> 00:28:48.956
whether it's revocable or not.

641
00:28:49.776 --> 00:28:51.736
Some other details
about what that app was.

642
00:28:52.786 --> 00:28:54.616
You also get all the
details about the user.

643
00:28:55.176 --> 00:28:58.356
And there are several different
ways to reference the user

644
00:28:58.356 --> 00:28:59.716
and I'm going to cover
that in a moment.

645
00:29:00.386 --> 00:29:03.576
So breaking this down
into their various tasks,

646
00:29:03.576 --> 00:29:06.016
you need to perform and the
services that you'll use

647
00:29:06.016 --> 00:29:07.036
to perform those tasks.

648
00:29:07.216 --> 00:29:09.706
I already mentioned
the VPPServiceConfigSrv

649
00:29:09.786 --> 00:29:11.686
that you'll use to
fetch the current names

650
00:29:11.686 --> 00:29:12.996
for all of these services.

651
00:29:14.076 --> 00:29:17.286
The registered VPPUserSrv is
what you will use to obtain

652
00:29:17.336 --> 00:29:20.836
that individualized invitation
URL to construct the invitation

653
00:29:20.946 --> 00:29:22.886
to invite users to
link to the program.

654
00:29:25.906 --> 00:29:28.596
There's a service that will
allow you to get all the details

655
00:29:28.596 --> 00:29:31.616
about a specific user including
any licenses currently assigned

656
00:29:31.616 --> 00:29:32.176
to that user.

657
00:29:33.416 --> 00:29:35.096
You can of course get
a list of all the users

658
00:29:35.096 --> 00:29:38.366
in your organization including
fetching only the users

659
00:29:38.366 --> 00:29:39.246
that have been modified

660
00:29:39.246 --> 00:29:41.226
since the last time you
downloaded the list.

661
00:29:42.626 --> 00:29:45.056
You can also request a
list of every license

662
00:29:45.106 --> 00:29:48.166
that that organization
has purchased including

663
00:29:48.226 --> 00:29:50.106
if there is a user
assigned to any of them.

664
00:29:50.976 --> 00:29:55.116
And then finally, the pair-- the
one that I showed you an example

665
00:29:55.116 --> 00:29:56.506
of that actually
assigns a license

666
00:29:56.556 --> 00:29:59.066
to a user and then revokes it.

667
00:30:00.496 --> 00:30:02.176
There are a few additional
services

668
00:30:02.176 --> 00:30:04.636
that performs an important
housekeeping tasks including

669
00:30:04.636 --> 00:30:06.406
if you want to update
any of the user metadata,

670
00:30:06.406 --> 00:30:09.266
if you want to store
some additional metadata

671
00:30:09.266 --> 00:30:14.736
for the organization, and if
a user leaves the organization

672
00:30:14.736 --> 00:30:18.766
for whatever reason or no longer
needs to be provided assets,

673
00:30:19.546 --> 00:30:20.916
you can retire that user

674
00:30:21.076 --> 00:30:22.776
and disassociate
their iTunes account

675
00:30:22.936 --> 00:30:25.616
which will also revoke any
revocable licenses currently

676
00:30:25.616 --> 00:30:26.516
assigned to that user.

677
00:30:27.506 --> 00:30:31.006
You can of course later reinvite
that retired user if desired

678
00:30:32.376 --> 00:30:35.386
by passing along their
previous user string

679
00:30:35.776 --> 00:30:37.566
to the registered service.

680
00:30:38.606 --> 00:30:40.436
Now, I mentioned earlier
there are a number

681
00:30:40.436 --> 00:30:42.256
of different user
concepts within the system.

682
00:30:42.376 --> 00:30:43.906
So let's talk about that now.

683
00:30:44.676 --> 00:30:47.716
The first is your MDM
solutions idea of the user.

684
00:30:48.346 --> 00:30:51.276
That's represented in the system
by the client user ID string,

685
00:30:51.996 --> 00:30:53.716
which is typically
going to be a UUID

686
00:30:53.926 --> 00:30:55.876
and this may be the
representation coming

687
00:30:55.876 --> 00:30:58.116
out of the directory
that's feeding users

688
00:30:58.116 --> 00:30:59.276
in groups into your solution.

689
00:31:00.296 --> 00:31:03.366
The second is the VPP--

690
00:31:03.366 --> 00:31:05.536
the Volume Purchase
Programs ID of the user.

691
00:31:05.536 --> 00:31:07.286
And that's represented
by the user ID.

692
00:31:08.706 --> 00:31:10.566
Finally, there's
the user's Apple ID,

693
00:31:10.766 --> 00:31:13.356
which again we don't want to
reveal to the MDM solution

694
00:31:13.356 --> 00:31:14.276
and the organization,

695
00:31:14.566 --> 00:31:18.286
so you will receive
Hash of that Apple ID.

696
00:31:18.916 --> 00:31:21.326
So there's three kinds
of users can be combined

697
00:31:21.326 --> 00:31:23.686
at the two different key forms
or the ways that represent--

698
00:31:23.686 --> 00:31:25.846
or referring to a
particular user.

699
00:31:26.686 --> 00:31:28.716
The user ID is just
a single long

700
00:31:29.636 --> 00:31:33.076
and then the other form is tuple
of the client user ID string,

701
00:31:33.076 --> 00:31:36.446
again typically UUID and
the Hash of the Apple ID.

702
00:31:37.106 --> 00:31:40.166
Now, these two key forms
have a one-to-one association

703
00:31:40.166 --> 00:31:42.756
at any one given time,
but that's not immutable,

704
00:31:43.056 --> 00:31:47.116
that link can change if a
user is retired and reinvited.

705
00:31:47.116 --> 00:31:51.346
So, let's talk a little
about the user ID key form.

706
00:31:51.926 --> 00:31:53.656
This one is very easy
to track as it's just

707
00:31:53.656 --> 00:31:58.276
that one single long
integer, and as I mentioned,

708
00:31:58.276 --> 00:32:01.386
it's always tied to exactly
one client user ID string

709
00:31:58.276 --> 00:32:01.386
it's always tied to exactly
one client user ID string

710
00:32:01.656 --> 00:32:05.216
but that reference can
change, and in fact can change

711
00:32:05.216 --> 00:32:07.076
when the user accepts
the invitation.

712
00:32:07.646 --> 00:32:11.076
So, I'm going to illustrate that
again with a little diagram.

713
00:32:11.516 --> 00:32:15.296
So, at this point, the
MDM solution has its idea

714
00:32:15.296 --> 00:32:19.466
of what this user's UUID
is from their directory

715
00:32:19.536 --> 00:32:21.806
and has called the
register service

716
00:32:21.876 --> 00:32:25.546
to obtain an individualized
URL for that user,

717
00:32:26.006 --> 00:32:27.956
which now is identified
with user ID2 .

718
00:32:28.716 --> 00:32:30.456
That invitation sent
out to the user

719
00:32:30.976 --> 00:32:34.626
and when the user accepts it,
the MDM server will be provided

720
00:32:34.626 --> 00:32:37.196
with the Hash of that Apple ID.

721
00:32:37.626 --> 00:32:39.796
Now, let's imagine that
for whatever reason

722
00:32:39.796 --> 00:32:44.336
that user is retired, and in
fact this is not the first time

723
00:32:44.336 --> 00:32:46.476
that this has happened,
there was a former user ID1,

724
00:32:46.476 --> 00:32:52.906
but now retired that link,
generate a new invitation

725
00:32:52.906 --> 00:32:55.816
for user ID3 which could be
sent out to the user again

726
00:32:56.146 --> 00:32:58.866
which could accept-- who could
accept it with the same Apple ID

727
00:32:58.866 --> 00:32:59.896
or different Apple ID.

728
00:33:00.436 --> 00:33:04.266
Now, let's talk about
the other key form based

729
00:33:04.266 --> 00:33:07.716
on the MDM's servers
idea of the user.

730
00:33:08.246 --> 00:33:11.506
Now, this more directly
maps between the MDM user

731
00:33:11.506 --> 00:33:16.986
and the Apple ID be it Hash.

732
00:33:17.196 --> 00:33:19.236
What you'll see is that
that hash will be null

733
00:33:19.236 --> 00:33:21.356
until the end user has
accepted the invitation.

734
00:33:22.076 --> 00:33:24.976
Once the user has accepted the
invitation that hash uniquely

735
00:33:24.976 --> 00:33:28.706
and of course opaquely refers
to that end user's Apple ID,

736
00:33:29.496 --> 00:33:32.486
however, there is a potential
problem here when you send

737
00:33:32.486 --> 00:33:33.276
out an invitation

738
00:33:33.276 --> 00:33:34.986
for a particular
client user ID string.

739
00:33:35.476 --> 00:33:37.236
If that invitation,
for whatever reason

740
00:33:37.236 --> 00:33:39.746
and let's say a student
forwards their invitation to one

741
00:33:39.746 --> 00:33:40.546
of their classmates,

742
00:33:41.426 --> 00:33:43.716
two different Apple IDs
can accept that invitation.

743
00:33:43.936 --> 00:33:45.186
There's no way to prevent that

744
00:33:45.456 --> 00:33:47.396
but this is almost certainly
something the admin is going

745
00:33:47.396 --> 00:33:48.186
to want to know about.

746
00:33:50.576 --> 00:33:54.666
Primarily because in that case,
there will be two MDM users

747
00:33:54.666 --> 00:33:58.496
and two VPP users and they
will allocate two licenses

748
00:33:58.576 --> 00:34:02.476
for an app perhaps
but they will not get

749
00:33:58.576 --> 00:34:02.476
for an app perhaps
but they will not get

750
00:34:02.476 --> 00:34:03.576
to two different Apple IDs,

751
00:34:03.576 --> 00:34:05.476
two different actual
users on devices.

752
00:34:06.306 --> 00:34:08.386
So again, let me illustrate
this with a simple diagram.

753
00:34:08.866 --> 00:34:10.735
Imagine two different MDM users.

754
00:34:11.315 --> 00:34:13.626
The MDM server generates

755
00:34:13.626 --> 00:34:15.876
or requests two different
invitation URLs and sends

756
00:34:15.876 --> 00:34:16.846
out those invitations.

757
00:34:18.606 --> 00:34:20.746
One of them is accepted
with a particular Apple ID

758
00:34:22.136 --> 00:34:24.235
and the other one is
accepted by the same Apple ID.

759
00:34:24.235 --> 00:34:26.186
And this is the state
that you want to detect

760
00:34:26.446 --> 00:34:30.106
and alert the user of
your admin console of.

761
00:34:33.116 --> 00:34:35.446
So again, emphasize that there--

762
00:34:35.446 --> 00:34:37.476
there's only one
active VPP user account

763
00:34:37.476 --> 00:34:39.775
for any given client user
ID string at one time.

764
00:34:39.775 --> 00:34:42.906
You're going to use that
string to identify this

765
00:34:42.906 --> 00:34:44.835
if you're using this
key form as opposed

766
00:34:44.835 --> 00:34:46.666
to the user ID VPP key form.

767
00:34:48.116 --> 00:34:52.636
If you want to get a retired
user back, you'll also have

768
00:34:52.636 --> 00:34:57.056
to provide the Hash that
you had for that user.

769
00:34:57.196 --> 00:34:59.826
So now I want to pass
along some advice from some

770
00:34:59.826 --> 00:35:02.766
of the engineers on my team who
are the first to adopt this API

771
00:34:59.826 --> 00:35:02.766
of the engineers on my team who
are the first to adopt this API

772
00:35:02.766 --> 00:35:04.706
and they have some
things that they'd

773
00:35:04.706 --> 00:35:05.576
like me to share with you.

774
00:35:06.756 --> 00:35:09.386
So one important decision is
which key form you want to use

775
00:35:09.556 --> 00:35:11.596
and they strongly recommend
that you choose one of them

776
00:35:11.596 --> 00:35:14.386
and always use that consistently
because if you want--

777
00:35:14.386 --> 00:35:15.726
if you try to mix them,
you're going to have

778
00:35:15.726 --> 00:35:17.616
to very carefully keep
them strictly in sync.

779
00:35:18.126 --> 00:35:24.496
Next, I want to talk about
a few individual areas

780
00:35:24.646 --> 00:35:26.346
of the system, first, users.

781
00:35:27.606 --> 00:35:29.956
When choo-- I've already
mentioned this several times

782
00:35:29.956 --> 00:35:33.066
that when you're choosing
what to represent each user

783
00:35:33.066 --> 00:35:37.396
in your MDM Solution, you
want to pick a Primary Key

784
00:35:37.396 --> 00:35:39.696
that won't change so you
don't want to use a username

785
00:35:39.696 --> 00:35:42.266
or an email address
'cause you won't be able

786
00:35:42.266 --> 00:35:44.466
to change this once they have
been invited and enrolled.

787
00:35:45.606 --> 00:35:47.506
We strongly recommend a UUID.

788
00:35:48.026 --> 00:35:51.996
You can make your server
the truth for user accounts

789
00:35:52.276 --> 00:35:54.696
but you're going to have to
handle retired accounts then

790
00:35:54.996 --> 00:35:56.936
which you can always fetch using

791
00:35:56.936 --> 00:36:02.856
to get VPP user service
'cause users may unenroll

792
00:35:56.936 --> 00:36:02.856
to get VPP user service
'cause users may unenroll

793
00:36:02.856 --> 00:36:04.956
from the service,
you may retire them.

794
00:36:05.856 --> 00:36:08.516
You can always reregister that
user and send a new invitation

795
00:36:08.626 --> 00:36:14.846
but of course that may be
linked from a new Apple ID.

796
00:36:14.966 --> 00:36:17.466
One important reason to keep
track of retired users is

797
00:36:17.466 --> 00:36:19.956
that if you have actually
transferred any irrevocable

798
00:36:19.956 --> 00:36:24.346
licenses for books because you
won't want to assign another--

799
00:36:24.346 --> 00:36:27.876
if the user was retired by
accident or for whatever reason,

800
00:36:27.876 --> 00:36:30.316
the student came back to
school, you don't want to end

801
00:36:30.316 --> 00:36:33.176
up transferring a second
irrevocable book license to them

802
00:36:33.176 --> 00:36:34.106
when they already have one.

803
00:36:34.946 --> 00:36:37.806
Next, let's talk a little
bit more about licenses.

804
00:36:38.536 --> 00:36:42.766
So similar to not relying on
the names of the service URLs,

805
00:36:43.286 --> 00:36:45.246
you don't want to assume
that you know forever

806
00:36:45.366 --> 00:36:47.796
which license types are
revocable and which are not.

807
00:36:48.116 --> 00:36:50.736
You want to always use-- is
that irrevocable attribute

808
00:36:50.836 --> 00:36:52.486
to determine whether a
particular license can

809
00:36:52.486 --> 00:36:52.996
be revoked.

810
00:36:53.386 --> 00:36:58.096
Another important consideration
is how to handle the difference

811
00:36:58.096 --> 00:37:00.066
between assigning a
license to the user

812
00:36:58.096 --> 00:37:00.066
between assigning a
license to the user

813
00:37:00.516 --> 00:37:02.676
and actually sending
the MDM Command

814
00:37:02.706 --> 00:37:07.966
to tell the device
to install that app.

815
00:37:08.226 --> 00:37:12.166
You can assign licenses before
inviting the user has accepted

816
00:37:12.166 --> 00:37:16.176
the invitation and associate
their Apple ID but you may want

817
00:37:16.176 --> 00:37:18.616
to wait until they've actually
accepted the invitation

818
00:37:18.616 --> 00:37:20.556
and that you have a
hash for their Apple ID

819
00:37:21.126 --> 00:37:23.576
because you don't want to end
up assigning licenses to users

820
00:37:23.576 --> 00:37:24.936
that never actually used them.

821
00:37:25.646 --> 00:37:27.896
And you want to incur-- make
it easy for organizations

822
00:37:27.896 --> 00:37:29.016
to prevent that from happening.

823
00:37:30.096 --> 00:37:32.656
Now similarly, you can make
the MDM Server the truth

824
00:37:32.656 --> 00:37:35.406
for revocable license
assignments but you don't have

825
00:37:35.406 --> 00:37:37.696
to worry about tracking
unassigned license IDs

826
00:37:37.696 --> 00:37:40.456
because when you call that
service to assign a license

827
00:37:40.676 --> 00:37:42.526
to a user, it will pick one

828
00:37:42.526 --> 00:37:44.086
of the unassigned
licenses from the pool.

829
00:37:45.456 --> 00:37:48.316
However, once you've assigned
a revocable license you do want

830
00:37:48.316 --> 00:37:50.346
to track those because
you'll need the license ID

831
00:37:50.346 --> 00:37:53.576
in order to revoke them.

832
00:37:53.786 --> 00:37:58.806
Finally, when thinking about
installing apps in the command,

833
00:37:58.916 --> 00:38:02.346
you've probably in the UI want
to separate the assignment

834
00:37:58.916 --> 00:38:02.346
you've probably in the UI want
to separate the assignment

835
00:38:02.346 --> 00:38:03.466
from the installation.

836
00:38:03.466 --> 00:38:06.176
It may seem at first like a
great idea to be able to do both

837
00:38:06.176 --> 00:38:10.066
at once but because of
the hugely scalable nature

838
00:38:10.066 --> 00:38:12.156
of the iTunes Store,
there may be some delay

839
00:38:12.156 --> 00:38:13.766
in the notification of--

840
00:38:13.766 --> 00:38:15.806
to the device that
assignment has been made

841
00:38:16.436 --> 00:38:18.696
and if the command comes
in before the assignment,

842
00:38:18.696 --> 00:38:20.396
before the device
knows it's entitled

843
00:38:20.396 --> 00:38:21.906
to that app, it will fail.

844
00:38:23.116 --> 00:38:24.896
There's also the
possibility that a student

845
00:38:24.946 --> 00:38:26.816
for whatever reason may
have signed out with

846
00:38:26.816 --> 00:38:30.746
that iTunes account and if the--
that account is not signed in,

847
00:38:31.356 --> 00:38:33.786
the device won't know that
it's authorized for that app

848
00:38:33.786 --> 00:38:38.116
and again, the command
will fail.

849
00:38:38.326 --> 00:38:41.326
So in summarizing, we
have made some big changes

850
00:38:41.326 --> 00:38:43.046
to the App Store
Volume Purchase Program.

851
00:38:43.236 --> 00:38:45.096
We've added revocable
app assignments.

852
00:38:45.736 --> 00:38:47.016
We've allowed new systems

853
00:38:47.016 --> 00:38:48.776
that also support
permanent book assignments.

854
00:38:49.456 --> 00:38:51.446
There's a new MDM
Command to tell the device

855
00:38:51.446 --> 00:38:53.786
to install whatever apps
are assigned to them.

856
00:38:54.716 --> 00:38:57.436
All of these is fully
integrated with iOS Managed apps

857
00:38:57.726 --> 00:38:59.656
so that organizations
can be confident

858
00:39:00.136 --> 00:39:03.056
in using this new system while
still protecting their secured

859
00:39:03.056 --> 00:39:06.336
data being used by those apps,
whatever those apps may be

860
00:39:07.106 --> 00:39:10.476
and all of this works really
great with OS X caching server

861
00:39:11.256 --> 00:39:13.866
so that even if a
school for example needs

862
00:39:13.866 --> 00:39:18.656
to assign a thousand copies of
20 apps to all their devices

863
00:39:18.656 --> 00:39:20.756
on campus, they can only--

864
00:39:20.756 --> 00:39:23.096
they only have to download
each app once to their site

865
00:39:23.096 --> 00:39:24.016
to the caching server.

866
00:39:24.576 --> 00:39:28.486
And with that, I'd like to turn

867
00:39:28.486 --> 00:39:30.586
to our final section
of the session today.

868
00:39:31.326 --> 00:39:33.436
And I know some of you might
be wondering what I mean

869
00:39:33.436 --> 00:39:34.816
by Streamlined Device
Enrollment.

870
00:39:36.196 --> 00:39:37.276
Well, those of you
who have worked

871
00:39:37.276 --> 00:39:40.666
on MDM products have already
had to solve this problem

872
00:39:40.666 --> 00:39:42.656
of how do I establish
that initial connection

873
00:39:42.656 --> 00:39:44.656
from each device back
to my MDM server.

874
00:39:45.476 --> 00:39:47.366
Some of you have created
apps for the App Store.

875
00:39:47.926 --> 00:39:50.826
Some of you created web
portals but those require

876
00:39:50.826 --> 00:39:53.376
that the organization using your
product then train their users

877
00:39:53.376 --> 00:39:55.516
how to use those apps,
where to find them,

878
00:39:55.906 --> 00:39:57.276
how to complete the enrollment.

879
00:39:57.636 --> 00:39:59.556
Some of you have documented
how to use our own tools

880
00:39:59.556 --> 00:40:02.196
like Apple Configurator to
complete that initial step.

881
00:39:59.556 --> 00:40:02.196
like Apple Configurator to
complete that initial step.

882
00:40:03.396 --> 00:40:05.786
But wouldn't it be easier
if we gave you this.

883
00:40:07.876 --> 00:40:09.836
[laughter] An easy button
for device enrollment.

884
00:40:12.336 --> 00:40:13.016
We think so.

885
00:40:13.016 --> 00:40:14.966
We think this will be great
both for the organization

886
00:40:15.106 --> 00:40:17.036
and for the end users and
that's what we're doing.

887
00:40:17.626 --> 00:40:20.926
We're adding a new
enrollment method solely

888
00:40:20.926 --> 00:40:22.886
for devices purchased
by an organization.

889
00:40:22.886 --> 00:40:27.136
This is not for BYOD but for
organization-owned devices,

890
00:40:27.596 --> 00:40:28.576
there's two steps.

891
00:40:29.066 --> 00:40:32.856
One for the organization, they
need to provide a small number

892
00:40:32.856 --> 00:40:35.506
of settings for how they want
this enrollment to be performed

893
00:40:35.616 --> 00:40:36.776
to this new Apple service

894
00:40:37.936 --> 00:40:40.336
and we have integrated the
enrollment process right

895
00:40:40.336 --> 00:40:43.826
into the Setup Assistant in
both iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks

896
00:40:44.116 --> 00:40:46.546
to give the user the
standard out-of-box device

897
00:40:46.546 --> 00:40:46.986
experience [applause].

898
00:40:51.266 --> 00:40:53.576
So let's talk about
how this will look

899
00:40:53.576 --> 00:40:55.836
from both the organization
and the end user perspective.

900
00:40:56.306 --> 00:40:57.106
So what's the workflow

901
00:40:57.106 --> 00:40:59.276
for an organization now
using this new service?

902
00:40:59.886 --> 00:41:01.826
Well, they hopefully
order lots and lots

903
00:40:59.886 --> 00:41:01.826
Well, they hopefully
order lots and lots

904
00:41:01.826 --> 00:41:03.666
of Apple devices from us.

905
00:41:04.516 --> 00:41:07.636
They assign those devices
to this new service.

906
00:41:08.896 --> 00:41:11.106
They decide which settings
that they want to use

907
00:41:11.206 --> 00:41:12.376
for those devices to be enrolled

908
00:41:12.376 --> 00:41:14.256
and they can use different
settings for different groups

909
00:41:14.256 --> 00:41:16.506
of devices, for example
different schools.

910
00:41:16.856 --> 00:41:21.196
They receive their shipment of
the devices and they hand them

911
00:41:21.196 --> 00:41:22.946
out in the box to
their end user.

912
00:41:24.266 --> 00:41:25.396
That's all they have to do.

913
00:41:28.576 --> 00:41:30.656
[applause] So what does the
user do when they get this box?

914
00:41:30.656 --> 00:41:31.656
Well, they open it just

915
00:41:31.656 --> 00:41:33.316
as if they purchased it
from the Apple store.

916
00:41:33.886 --> 00:41:36.046
They begin walking through
the Standard Setup Assistant.

917
00:41:36.376 --> 00:41:40.596
They choose their network
then they're prompted

918
00:41:40.596 --> 00:41:43.596
by your MDM Solution for
credentials to authenticate

919
00:41:43.596 --> 00:41:45.486
who they are to make sure

920
00:41:45.486 --> 00:41:47.566
that only authorized
users are enrolling

921
00:41:47.566 --> 00:41:49.996
in the Device Management
System deployed

922
00:41:49.996 --> 00:41:55.146
by that organization, that's it.

923
00:41:55.426 --> 00:41:56.896
So let's start talking
about a little bit of--

924
00:41:56.896 --> 00:41:57.706
few of the details.

925
00:41:58.766 --> 00:42:00.326
There are a couple
of critical settings,

926
00:41:58.766 --> 00:42:00.326
There are a couple
of critical settings,

927
00:42:00.326 --> 00:42:03.176
the most important one
is the URL for enrolling

928
00:42:03.176 --> 00:42:04.796
in your Device Management
Solutions.

929
00:42:06.436 --> 00:42:09.256
There's also an option the
organization can decide whether

930
00:42:09.256 --> 00:42:11.556
or not they want to allow
the user to skip enrollment

931
00:42:11.556 --> 00:42:14.106
or whether they want to make it
mandatory and prevent the user

932
00:42:14.106 --> 00:42:16.276
from preceding through
setup and using the device

933
00:42:16.276 --> 00:42:18.856
without accepting enrollment
in Remote Device Management.

934
00:42:20.256 --> 00:42:23.116
There are a few additional
options specific to iOS devices,

935
00:42:24.086 --> 00:42:26.906
first of which is that you--
the organization could decide

936
00:42:26.906 --> 00:42:28.846
that they want to
supervise these devices.

937
00:42:29.416 --> 00:42:31.726
You may not realize
what that means,

938
00:42:31.726 --> 00:42:33.076
you'll no longer be required

939
00:42:33.076 --> 00:42:35.126
to use Apple Configurators
Supervised devices.

940
00:42:35.126 --> 00:42:37.056
It can now be done
over-the-air using this new

941
00:42:37.056 --> 00:42:37.956
enrollment service.

942
00:42:42.346 --> 00:42:44.246
[applause] I alluded to
this earlier but in addition

943
00:42:44.246 --> 00:42:45.896
to that change to supervision,

944
00:42:46.156 --> 00:42:47.666
we're also separating
the concept

945
00:42:47.666 --> 00:42:50.356
of supervision giving you access
to additional restrictions

946
00:42:50.356 --> 00:42:52.736
in settings from the
pairing restrictions

947
00:42:53.306 --> 00:42:55.796
and the organization can now
choose whether or not they want

948
00:42:55.796 --> 00:42:57.656
to prevent the supervised device

949
00:42:57.656 --> 00:42:59.706
from pairing from--
with any Mac.

950
00:43:02.556 --> 00:43:04.206
[applause] We think this
will be great in schools

951
00:43:04.206 --> 00:43:05.966
where students-- where
schools really want

952
00:43:05.966 --> 00:43:07.596
to have the additional
restrictions

953
00:43:07.596 --> 00:43:09.916
but also want their students
to be able to connect a Mac--

954
00:43:10.276 --> 00:43:13.236
or sorry connect an iOS device
to a Mac to get their photo

955
00:43:13.236 --> 00:43:15.866
or video content off to
edit in iPhoto or iMovie.

956
00:43:16.656 --> 00:43:19.946
And then finally, I think
you'll like this as well,

957
00:43:20.856 --> 00:43:23.876
for devices that have been
enrolled using this new service,

958
00:43:24.846 --> 00:43:26.906
the organization can also
choose to prevent their users

959
00:43:26.906 --> 00:43:28.516
from removing MDM enrollment

960
00:43:28.516 --> 00:43:30.836
so that they can be confident
the device will continue

961
00:43:30.836 --> 00:43:32.656
to be enrolled and
manageable over-the-air.

962
00:43:34.336 --> 00:43:37.946
Now that's all great, that's
all about device enrollment,

963
00:43:38.156 --> 00:43:39.336
but we didn't stop there either.

964
00:43:40.186 --> 00:43:42.806
We also wanted to streamline
the entire setup experience

965
00:43:42.956 --> 00:43:44.226
so that part of the Settings

966
00:43:44.226 --> 00:43:47.186
of this new service also allow
an organization to decide

967
00:43:47.186 --> 00:43:49.486
to skip certain panes
in the setup assistant.

968
00:43:49.886 --> 00:43:52.556
For example, if a school doesn't
want to ask their 10-year-olds

969
00:43:52.556 --> 00:43:54.966
to decide whether or not they
want a location service is

970
00:43:54.966 --> 00:43:56.636
enabled or whether they're going

971
00:43:56.636 --> 00:44:01.166
to send diagnostics
back to Apple.

972
00:43:56.636 --> 00:44:01.166
to send diagnostics
back to Apple.

973
00:44:01.166 --> 00:44:03.726
So again, let's turn from
the way the feature--

974
00:44:03.726 --> 00:44:06.276
the system works to
what work you need to do

975
00:44:06.826 --> 00:44:08.666
and it again breaks
down to three areas.

976
00:44:09.496 --> 00:44:13.056
Similar account authentication
to the new App Store VPP.

977
00:44:13.056 --> 00:44:16.666
You'll need to create a settings
editor for that small handful

978
00:44:16.666 --> 00:44:17.406
of settings for the--

979
00:44:17.406 --> 00:44:18.716
your customers to be able

980
00:44:18.716 --> 00:44:20.696
to specify how they want
their devices enrolled.

981
00:44:22.396 --> 00:44:25.436
And you'll need to be able to
communicate with the new service

982
00:44:25.596 --> 00:44:27.416
to tell it which groups
the device you should get

983
00:44:27.416 --> 00:44:28.246
which settings.

984
00:44:30.906 --> 00:44:33.116
So walk you through an
architecture diagram

985
00:44:33.116 --> 00:44:34.176
to show you how this will work.

986
00:44:35.516 --> 00:44:37.306
The organization
purchases devices.

987
00:44:38.726 --> 00:44:40.736
They add those devices
into this new service.

988
00:44:41.846 --> 00:44:44.596
Your MDM Solution talks to
the enrollment service to find

989
00:44:44.596 --> 00:44:47.596
out the list of devices that
are eligible for this service,

990
00:44:47.936 --> 00:44:50.086
pushes up the settings for
groups of those devices.

991
00:44:50.956 --> 00:44:53.696
Once that's been done,
as devices start to go

992
00:44:53.696 --> 00:44:54.766
through the setup assistant,

993
00:44:55.266 --> 00:44:57.816
they contact the enrollment
service to get their Settings

994
00:44:58.886 --> 00:45:02.486
and enroll in your MDM Server
which can then manage them

995
00:44:58.886 --> 00:45:02.486
and enroll in your MDM Server
which can then manage them

996
00:45:02.486 --> 00:45:03.546
in all of the ways we've talked

997
00:45:03.546 --> 00:45:05.346
about earlier via
the MDM Protocol

998
00:45:05.346 --> 00:45:06.566
and Configuration Profiles.

999
00:45:09.576 --> 00:45:11.846
So again there are a
couple of these tasks

1000
00:45:11.846 --> 00:45:13.666
and there are services
that you'll use

1001
00:45:13.666 --> 00:45:17.116
to perform those tasks to
get started with the service,

1002
00:45:17.116 --> 00:45:19.126
to get the account details
for that organization,

1003
00:45:19.576 --> 00:45:20.726
to fetch the device list,

1004
00:45:23.036 --> 00:45:25.796
handling the settings
whether you're defining them

1005
00:45:25.796 --> 00:45:27.836
and pushing them up to the
service and then assigning them

1006
00:45:27.836 --> 00:45:30.296
to groups of devices and
fetching the settings back.

1007
00:45:31.396 --> 00:45:33.586
And then some more
housekeeping services

1008
00:45:34.006 --> 00:45:35.916
that fetch specific
details about devices.

1009
00:45:35.916 --> 00:45:38.476
If you have to remove
devices from the services

1010
00:45:38.476 --> 00:45:39.986
if an organization sells them.

1011
00:45:41.006 --> 00:45:42.956
Or to remove settings that
they're no longer using.

1012
00:45:43.496 --> 00:45:49.556
And so just to further encourage
you to integrate this service

1013
00:45:49.556 --> 00:45:50.636
as quickly as possible,

1014
00:45:50.636 --> 00:45:52.866
I just want to quickly
illustrate what the OS X setup

1015
00:45:52.866 --> 00:45:54.496
experience looks like today.

1016
00:45:55.676 --> 00:45:58.526
You have to go through these 14
screens to get to where you want

1017
00:45:58.526 --> 00:46:02.336
to be which is that user-- using
their Mac to work or learn.

1018
00:45:58.526 --> 00:46:02.336
to be which is that user-- using
their Mac to work or learn.

1019
00:46:03.456 --> 00:46:04.886
Now I know you want
to see what it looks

1020
00:46:04.886 --> 00:46:07.286
like using the service fully.

1021
00:46:07.806 --> 00:46:09.186
But I don't want to show
it to you in slides.

1022
00:46:09.446 --> 00:46:11.296
I'm going to ask you to Jussi
and Chris to come back up

1023
00:46:11.656 --> 00:46:14.726
and show you the-- both of
these systems working together

1024
00:46:15.236 --> 00:46:17.876
so that all of you are really
excited about going off

1025
00:46:17.876 --> 00:46:19.366
and integrating both
of these services

1026
00:46:19.366 --> 00:46:21.536
so that together we can
provide our customers

1027
00:46:21.576 --> 00:46:23.886
with an outstanding
setup experience

1028
00:46:23.886 --> 00:46:25.156
in education and enterprise.

1029
00:46:25.456 --> 00:46:27.466
So we're going to show
you from taking the device

1030
00:46:27.466 --> 00:46:31.146
out of the box, enrolling it in
MDM and assigning it content.

1031
00:46:31.456 --> 00:46:32.426
So guys, take it away.

1032
00:46:32.686 --> 00:46:35.226
>> Jussi: All right,
thank you Todd.

1033
00:46:35.226 --> 00:46:38.106
So I'm not going to have
my Mac Book in a box.

1034
00:46:38.206 --> 00:46:41.006
So this is basically
imagine if this came in a box

1035
00:46:41.236 --> 00:46:43.576
on a container of like
thousands of Mac Books

1036
00:46:43.956 --> 00:46:45.586
and this is the setup that
I'm going to go through.

1037
00:46:45.846 --> 00:46:49.436
So power it up and I get
to see some of the panes

1038
00:46:49.436 --> 00:46:51.446
that I usually see, and it's not

1039
00:46:51.446 --> 00:46:53.776
that this setup experiences
is really slow today, I mean,

1040
00:46:53.896 --> 00:46:55.966
we have pretty fast going
through the setup today.

1041
00:46:56.266 --> 00:46:59.226
This is just faster than
what we have right now.

1042
00:46:59.656 --> 00:47:02.096
So I set my country,
set my keyboard

1043
00:46:59.656 --> 00:47:02.096
So I set my country,
set my keyboard

1044
00:47:02.516 --> 00:47:03.546
and the first thing that's--

1045
00:47:03.966 --> 00:47:05.486
or it still needs
to pick a network.

1046
00:47:06.586 --> 00:47:11.586
So let's go to ACME Wi-Fi, I
you have to Wi-Fi, go ACME.

1047
00:47:11.786 --> 00:47:15.036
And what Todd is--
Todd is explaining is

1048
00:47:15.036 --> 00:47:18.236
that we have MDM sever that has
implemented this streamlined

1049
00:47:18.236 --> 00:47:19.286
device enrollment protocol.

1050
00:47:19.576 --> 00:47:23.216
So now, my setup assistant
has just contacted Apple.

1051
00:47:23.216 --> 00:47:25.676
So what happened is
that the configuration

1052
00:47:25.736 --> 00:47:28.766
for this machine was found
in the Apple services

1053
00:47:29.066 --> 00:47:31.536
and it basically said
you are called ACME, Inc.

1054
00:47:31.646 --> 00:47:33.826
Here's the number to call if
you don't know what this is

1055
00:47:34.096 --> 00:47:36.236
and would you like to
apply these settings.

1056
00:47:36.616 --> 00:47:39.396
So-- and in this case, I have
an option of skipping this

1057
00:47:39.706 --> 00:47:41.326
or accepting the configuration.

1058
00:47:41.936 --> 00:47:45.346
So I will accept
this configuration.

1059
00:47:45.346 --> 00:47:46.306
And now what happened is

1060
00:47:46.306 --> 00:47:50.806
that the configuration
contains a call home URL.

1061
00:47:51.176 --> 00:47:53.436
So the MDM server
has a new feature

1062
00:47:53.436 --> 00:47:54.876
for authenticating users.

1063
00:47:55.086 --> 00:47:58.176
So this system is no longer
talking to Apple services.

1064
00:47:58.176 --> 00:48:01.146
This now talking to an MDM
server that will be hosted

1065
00:47:58.176 --> 00:48:01.146
This now talking to an MDM
server that will be hosted

1066
00:48:01.146 --> 00:48:03.986
by the organization would
be in the company or in--

1067
00:48:03.986 --> 00:48:07.106
at school and the username
password is what I would use

1068
00:48:07.276 --> 00:48:10.476
to log in to that company's,
that school's systems.

1069
00:48:10.866 --> 00:48:13.246
So I will be-- in this
case, I will be Jack.

1070
00:48:14.426 --> 00:48:16.946
And Jack is going to
have a password hopefully

1071
00:48:16.946 --> 00:48:17.536
that I can remember.

1072
00:48:17.536 --> 00:48:21.636
And now we are done
with the configuration.

1073
00:48:22.036 --> 00:48:24.086
So I still have to
create a local pass--

1074
00:48:24.086 --> 00:48:25.336
local user for this machine.

1075
00:48:25.866 --> 00:48:32.026
And there it goes,
Jack and that's it.

1076
00:48:32.406 --> 00:48:35.456
So if you saw the-- saw the
screens that we have before,

1077
00:48:35.726 --> 00:48:38.866
we didn't get to see a do I
want to register this machine

1078
00:48:38.866 --> 00:48:40.506
because this was
organization purchased.

1079
00:48:40.706 --> 00:48:41.636
It doesn't really make sense

1080
00:48:41.636 --> 00:48:43.316
to have the individuals
still register it again.

1081
00:48:43.716 --> 00:48:47.426
I didn't get to see an Apple ID
because the organization decided

1082
00:48:47.426 --> 00:48:49.926
that that may not be applicable
for this system or this user.

1083
00:48:50.446 --> 00:48:51.476
And here we are.

1084
00:48:51.476 --> 00:48:53.426
We are ready to set
the system or ready

1085
00:48:53.426 --> 00:48:54.716
to put the system in use.

1086
00:48:55.046 --> 00:48:58.976
And I land finder with a
wonderful and new background.

1087
00:48:59.716 --> 00:49:00.636
Here we go.

1088
00:48:59.716 --> 00:49:00.636
Here we go.

1089
00:49:00.636 --> 00:49:01.466
Let's go surfing.

1090
00:49:01.846 --> 00:49:07.436
And when I go to my
preferences I noticed

1091
00:49:07.436 --> 00:49:09.836
that I already have a
enrollment profile here.

1092
00:49:09.836 --> 00:49:13.956
So I have a system-- I have
a profile that was installed

1093
00:49:13.956 --> 00:49:16.666
on the system as part of
enrolling into the MDM service.

1094
00:49:16.916 --> 00:49:19.756
So here I have remote
management already enabled

1095
00:49:19.826 --> 00:49:22.996
and now the organization
can send me any profiles

1096
00:49:22.996 --> 00:49:24.806
that are applicable
for this user

1097
00:49:25.016 --> 00:49:27.456
on this system and
I'm good to go.

1098
00:49:27.746 --> 00:49:29.886
So that's the setup
experience on the Mac.

1099
00:49:30.516 --> 00:49:35.656
[ Applause ]

1100
00:49:36.156 --> 00:49:39.516
So an iOS device, so I
have an iPhone in the box

1101
00:49:39.816 --> 00:49:41.266
that I did cut open, sorry,

1102
00:49:41.266 --> 00:49:43.736
so we get to have the
nice woosh effect.

1103
00:49:44.096 --> 00:49:44.996
Here we go.

1104
00:49:45.536 --> 00:49:47.966
And I did power it
on, sorry, I cheated.

1105
00:49:48.286 --> 00:49:49.506
So it's already on.

1106
00:49:50.116 --> 00:49:51.906
So if and go to the
phone please.

1107
00:49:52.886 --> 00:49:54.076
There we go.

1108
00:49:54.076 --> 00:49:55.846
I could learn lots
of languages here.

1109
00:49:56.126 --> 00:49:57.856
I think that means caller.

1110
00:49:58.126 --> 00:50:00.666
Let's go set this up.

1111
00:49:58.126 --> 00:50:00.666
Let's go set this up.

1112
00:50:01.316 --> 00:50:02.156
Here we go.

1113
00:50:02.356 --> 00:50:04.576
So again, I get to
choose my language.

1114
00:50:05.716 --> 00:50:07.076
I'm still in the US.

1115
00:50:08.056 --> 00:50:10.486
I get to choose my
ACME Wi-Fi again.

1116
00:50:10.816 --> 00:50:13.916
So here, the configuration
profile that was downloaded

1117
00:50:13.916 --> 00:50:17.806
from the streamlined device
enrollment service now got the

1118
00:50:17.806 --> 00:50:19.836
record from Apple again.

1119
00:50:19.836 --> 00:50:22.946
And we know that
this device needs

1120
00:50:22.946 --> 00:50:24.076
to be configured for the system.

1121
00:50:24.386 --> 00:50:26.746
And you'll notice that I
don't have an option to skip.

1122
00:50:27.036 --> 00:50:31.426
So I have to go through this
setup assistant or the iOS setup

1123
00:50:31.426 --> 00:50:33.496
with this configuration
from my organization.

1124
00:50:33.836 --> 00:50:36.276
So there's no option to opt out.

1125
00:50:36.276 --> 00:50:39.456
So again, I'll configure
this device.

1126
00:50:39.456 --> 00:50:43.156
And again I'll log
into my company account

1127
00:50:43.156 --> 00:50:45.086
and again this device
is now talking

1128
00:50:45.086 --> 00:50:47.936
to the MDM server
authentication part that's going

1129
00:50:47.936 --> 00:50:50.456
to be implemented by all the
new MDM servers out there.

1130
00:50:51.246 --> 00:50:59.906
So I'll log in here, and I
get configurations set down.

1131
00:51:00.196 --> 00:51:02.726
And here we are installing
the configuration

1132
00:51:02.726 --> 00:51:05.276
from a company and
I'm good to go.

1133
00:51:05.976 --> 00:51:08.576
So here I am in my home screen.

1134
00:51:08.926 --> 00:51:11.776
I have a basically a clean
system but now if I go

1135
00:51:11.776 --> 00:51:15.506
to my settings and
look at some details.

1136
00:51:15.926 --> 00:51:18.606
So notice that this
device is supervised.

1137
00:51:19.106 --> 00:51:22.396
So this device was not
connected to Apple Configurator.

1138
00:51:22.396 --> 00:51:24.656
It was never plugged
into any system

1139
00:51:24.946 --> 00:51:26.136
but it's already supervised.

1140
00:51:26.366 --> 00:51:28.046
So I can now take
advantage of some

1141
00:51:28.046 --> 00:51:29.876
of the new supervised features

1142
00:51:29.876 --> 00:51:32.756
like installing [inaudible]
apps, doing other restrictions

1143
00:51:32.756 --> 00:51:35.356
that wouldn't apply to
non-supervised devices.

1144
00:51:35.666 --> 00:51:38.646
So this is supervision without
tethering using the streamlined

1145
00:51:38.646 --> 00:51:40.206
device configuration service.

1146
00:51:40.926 --> 00:51:43.156
And other part is
that you'll notice

1147
00:51:43.156 --> 00:51:44.966
that I have configuration
profiles installed.

1148
00:51:44.966 --> 00:51:47.716
And if I'm looking
at my MDM profile,

1149
00:51:47.716 --> 00:51:49.376
there is no remove button.

1150
00:51:49.376 --> 00:51:53.116
So the only way-- [applause]
thank you, yes, yes please.

1151
00:51:55.806 --> 00:51:59.796
There's no way for the user
to exit the management state

1152
00:51:59.796 --> 00:52:02.576
and if they restore the phone,

1153
00:51:59.796 --> 00:52:02.576
and if they restore the phone,

1154
00:52:02.576 --> 00:52:04.296
basically erase/install
the phone,

1155
00:52:04.476 --> 00:52:07.436
it will still have the
streamlined device on its record

1156
00:52:07.736 --> 00:52:09.446
in the cloud-- in
the Apple Cloud

1157
00:52:09.446 --> 00:52:12.196
and because this device is
required to have this setup,

1158
00:52:12.196 --> 00:52:15.006
you can't bypass the setup
assistant and you'll always end

1159
00:52:15.006 --> 00:52:15.866
up this management
state [applause].

1160
00:52:16.296 --> 00:52:21.886
OK, so that's fine and good.

1161
00:52:21.886 --> 00:52:24.216
We seem to have lack
of application.

1162
00:52:24.216 --> 00:52:27.236
I could spend days just looking
at stocks and playing videos.

1163
00:52:27.616 --> 00:52:29.656
But let's see what
apps this user has.

1164
00:52:30.086 --> 00:52:31.756
Well, it's an out-of-box system

1165
00:52:31.926 --> 00:52:33.806
so I don't have an
Apple ID signed in.

1166
00:52:34.146 --> 00:52:44.326
So let me go and sign
up with my ID here.

1167
00:52:44.436 --> 00:52:45.246
Oops. Oops.

1168
00:52:45.486 --> 00:52:48.206
OK, this is the demo
typing that's happening.

1169
00:52:49.546 --> 00:52:51.746
And you would spell that right.

1170
00:52:51.746 --> 00:52:54.166
There we go.

1171
00:52:54.416 --> 00:52:57.906
And then hopefully,
password is right.

1172
00:52:58.416 --> 00:53:02.826
And now log out.

1173
00:52:58.416 --> 00:53:02.826
And now log out.

1174
00:53:03.016 --> 00:53:07.726
So we have an Apple ID and
now we have some updates.

1175
00:53:07.726 --> 00:53:09.246
Oh sorry, not updates,
applications.

1176
00:53:09.516 --> 00:53:12.076
So this user has already
purchased some applications.

1177
00:53:12.696 --> 00:53:14.396
So here's my application list.

1178
00:53:14.776 --> 00:53:17.126
And these are effective
with the free apps by Apple.

1179
00:53:17.126 --> 00:53:18.996
So this user has a free Apple ID

1180
00:53:18.996 --> 00:53:20.686
with no credit card
associated with that.

1181
00:53:21.166 --> 00:53:22.246
That's kind of an anomaly.

1182
00:53:22.406 --> 00:53:24.986
Usually people do
buy apps for cash.

1183
00:53:25.306 --> 00:53:27.716
But in this case, this
has no CC on file.

1184
00:53:28.096 --> 00:53:31.656
So Chris is now going to assign
applications to this device.

1185
00:53:32.026 --> 00:53:35.486
So Chris is going to send
a list of applications

1186
00:53:35.536 --> 00:53:38.116
that the organization
has licenses for, OK.

1187
00:53:38.896 --> 00:53:39.356
Oh I'm sorry.

1188
00:53:39.356 --> 00:53:41.176
I'm skipping ahead of myself.

1189
00:53:41.556 --> 00:53:44.346
So how do we get this
user into this program?

1190
00:53:44.346 --> 00:53:46.716
Yes. We need to invite
that person.

1191
00:53:47.196 --> 00:53:48.236
And there are many ways

1192
00:53:48.236 --> 00:53:50.896
of getting the user
invited into program.

1193
00:53:50.896 --> 00:53:54.356
We can direct the user into a
portal or we can send an email

1194
00:53:54.836 --> 00:53:56.606
and we can send a
push notification.

1195
00:53:56.976 --> 00:53:59.706
So first I'm going
to show you an email

1196
00:53:59.996 --> 00:54:01.806
that the MDM console
is going to send.

1197
00:53:59.996 --> 00:54:01.806
that the MDM console
is going to send.

1198
00:54:01.806 --> 00:54:06.046
And that'll show up in
the device momentarily.

1199
00:54:06.516 --> 00:54:09.046
So here we have an
invitation email

1200
00:54:09.356 --> 00:54:12.336
that is basically asking the
user to enroll their Apple ID

1201
00:54:12.776 --> 00:54:14.036
with the corporate email.

1202
00:54:14.166 --> 00:54:16.356
So Apple does not know
what this email address is.

1203
00:54:16.616 --> 00:54:19.856
This is only for
the user to know

1204
00:54:19.856 --> 00:54:23.096
and then the user can
bind their Apple ID

1205
00:54:23.096 --> 00:54:25.386
and this corporate email account

1206
00:54:25.386 --> 00:54:26.606
and then they can
assign licenses.

1207
00:54:27.016 --> 00:54:32.356
But-- and this email is a URL
and that URL can be on a webpage

1208
00:54:32.426 --> 00:54:34.386
so depending on how the
MDM vendor would want

1209
00:54:34.386 --> 00:54:35.036
to implement this.

1210
00:54:35.256 --> 00:54:38.416
As long as they find a way to
display that URL to the user

1211
00:54:38.416 --> 00:54:41.426
and have the user click
that, then we're good to go.

1212
00:54:41.716 --> 00:54:43.966
So another way to
invite this user is

1213
00:54:43.966 --> 00:54:46.806
by sending a push command.

1214
00:54:46.806 --> 00:54:50.706
And now we get to log in to
the App Store or we get--

1215
00:54:50.706 --> 00:54:52.176
we are brought back
to the App Store.

1216
00:54:52.176 --> 00:54:55.446
And we know that OK,
this organization would

1217
00:54:55.446 --> 00:54:57.586
like to assign applications
for this ID.

1218
00:54:57.986 --> 00:55:00.586
And yes, now we got
three pushes.

1219
00:54:57.986 --> 00:55:00.586
And yes, now we got
three pushes.

1220
00:55:00.886 --> 00:55:02.906
So yes, I will allow apps
to be assigned to this.

1221
00:55:03.816 --> 00:55:08.956
And now, we have the user ID
that the email was sent to

1222
00:55:09.196 --> 00:55:11.666
and the account that
was associated

1223
00:55:11.696 --> 00:55:13.616
with this ID, now
they are linked.

1224
00:55:14.056 --> 00:55:17.036
And I've been just sitting here
and what Chris has been doing

1225
00:55:17.036 --> 00:55:19.936
as the survey admin, he is
assigned applications to me.

1226
00:55:20.196 --> 00:55:21.956
So they just show up
in my purchase list.

1227
00:55:22.306 --> 00:55:23.796
So I guess I have
a checklist thing.

1228
00:55:23.796 --> 00:55:25.226
I need to know what to do.

1229
00:55:25.226 --> 00:55:28.216
I have a things app
I need to learn math.

1230
00:55:28.216 --> 00:55:31.356
So these are the licensees
that the company has licensed

1231
00:55:31.356 --> 00:55:32.566
and assigned to this user.

1232
00:55:32.626 --> 00:55:34.646
And they show up in
my purchase list.

1233
00:55:35.206 --> 00:55:38.026
But even better way instead

1234
00:55:38.026 --> 00:55:40.156
of just having me pull
this application stone,

1235
00:55:40.156 --> 00:55:42.626
the administrator
can actually request

1236
00:55:42.626 --> 00:55:44.486
that these apps be
installed on this device.

1237
00:55:44.786 --> 00:55:47.606
So because this device is
supervised, Chris can now send

1238
00:55:47.606 --> 00:55:49.156
and request app install command

1239
00:55:49.156 --> 00:55:52.056
and these applications just
start showing up on the device

1240
00:55:52.336 --> 00:55:53.536
without me doing anything.

1241
00:55:54.516 --> 00:56:00.096
[ Applause ]

1242
00:55:54.516 --> 00:56:00.096
[ Applause ]

1243
00:56:00.596 --> 00:56:01.726
So-- and that is the demo.

1244
00:56:01.726 --> 00:56:02.256
Back to Todd.

1245
00:56:02.256 --> 00:56:02.676
Thank you.

1246
00:56:03.246 --> 00:56:04.116
>> Todd Fernandez: Thank
you very much guys.

1247
00:56:04.896 --> 00:56:09.606
All right, well before I sum up,
I just wanted to point something

1248
00:56:09.606 --> 00:56:12.296
around what Jussi said
about the ability of the--

1249
00:56:12.296 --> 00:56:14.636
even if the user wipes
the device, it's enrolled

1250
00:56:14.746 --> 00:56:16.536
in this new service, but
you're still going to have

1251
00:56:16.536 --> 00:56:17.436
to go through it each time.

1252
00:56:17.436 --> 00:56:18.456
You can't get around it.

1253
00:56:18.836 --> 00:56:21.256
This actually makes for a
great experience in schools

1254
00:56:21.256 --> 00:56:23.926
if a student graduates and
returns the device in school,

1255
00:56:24.026 --> 00:56:26.146
all they need to do to prevent--
prepare it for the next student

1256
00:56:26.146 --> 00:56:28.986
for the next year is wipe it
and hand it to the new student.

1257
00:56:29.776 --> 00:56:32.646
All right, so what have we--
what have we talked about today?

1258
00:56:32.886 --> 00:56:35.596
Well, we've added a huge
number of new capabilities

1259
00:56:35.596 --> 00:56:38.446
to configuration profiles and
MDM protocol for all of you

1260
00:56:38.446 --> 00:56:41.286
to adopt in your MDM solutions.

1261
00:56:42.006 --> 00:56:43.566
We've made big changes

1262
00:56:43.566 --> 00:56:45.176
to the App Store
Volume Purchased Program

1263
00:56:45.176 --> 00:56:48.266
to add revocable app assignments
as well as book assignments.

1264
00:56:48.886 --> 00:56:52.406
We've created a brand new
service that you just saw

1265
00:56:52.646 --> 00:56:55.706
to make it really easy for both
organizations and end users

1266
00:56:55.706 --> 00:56:58.696
to get their devices enrolled,
remote device management.

1267
00:56:59.626 --> 00:57:02.396
And I'm really looking forward
to working together with all

1268
00:56:59.626 --> 00:57:02.396
And I'm really looking forward
to working together with all

1269
00:57:02.396 --> 00:57:04.716
of you to get these
systems integrated

1270
00:57:04.716 --> 00:57:07.506
into your MDM products so that
we can make managing large

1271
00:57:07.506 --> 00:57:09.186
numbers of Apple
devices a pleasure

1272
00:57:09.186 --> 00:57:12.006
for both the organization
and each of their end users.

1273
00:57:12.556 --> 00:57:14.786
Now I hope the next question
in your mind is, Todd,

1274
00:57:14.786 --> 00:57:15.916
when can we get started?

1275
00:57:16.826 --> 00:57:19.346
Well, I have some good
news, the documentation

1276
00:57:19.346 --> 00:57:20.666
which includes details on how

1277
00:57:20.666 --> 00:57:23.456
to obtain your VPP Test
Accounts is available today.

1278
00:57:24.856 --> 00:57:27.166
And the device enrollment
accounts will be ready

1279
00:57:27.276 --> 00:57:28.426
next month.

1280
00:57:29.336 --> 00:57:31.686
So with that, I will leave
you with the pointers

1281
00:57:31.686 --> 00:57:35.206
to that documentation for
both the updated MDM protocol

1282
00:57:35.206 --> 00:57:38.146
that covers both the new App
Store Volume Purchase Program

1283
00:57:38.146 --> 00:57:39.796
as well as device
enrollment service,

1284
00:57:40.656 --> 00:57:42.586
an updated configuration
profile reference

1285
00:57:42.586 --> 00:57:44.246
that contains all
the new payloads

1286
00:57:44.246 --> 00:57:47.426
and changes we've talked in the
first section and the new forum

1287
00:57:47.426 --> 00:57:50.066
that you will hopefully
join to begin discussing how

1288
00:57:50.066 --> 00:57:51.966
to integrate these best
into your products.

1289
00:57:53.086 --> 00:57:54.986
As we've alluded during the
session, there are a number

1290
00:57:54.986 --> 00:57:57.166
of sessions that will be
interest to app developers

1291
00:57:57.166 --> 00:57:59.896
in particular who want to learn
more about how to take advantage

1292
00:57:59.896 --> 00:58:03.276
of these new management
features in their apps including

1293
00:57:59.896 --> 00:58:03.276
of these new management
features in their apps including

1294
00:58:03.276 --> 00:58:05.606
that receipt session I
promised on Thursday afternoon.

1295
00:58:06.046 --> 00:58:08.046
And with that, I will thank you
very much for your attention

1296
00:58:08.046 --> 00:58:09.406
and look forward to
seeing you in the lab.

1297
00:58:09.406 --> 00:58:11.016
[Applause]

1298
00:58:11.016 --> 00:58:15.866
[ Silence ]
