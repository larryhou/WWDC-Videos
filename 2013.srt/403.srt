1
00:00:00.506 --> 00:00:04.766
[ Silence ]

2
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:09.526
[Applause]

3
00:00:10.026 --> 00:00:11.196
>> Welcome, welcome.

4
00:00:12.686 --> 00:00:15.716
So I know it's almost lunch
- I need you guys to hang

5
00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:16.826
with me, we'll be fast.

6
00:00:17.086 --> 00:00:20.896
I'd like to start out with
a question for all of you:

7
00:00:21.686 --> 00:00:26.336
who here builds apps for iOS
devices or builds Mac apps

8
00:00:26.336 --> 00:00:28.336
that take advantage
of store-only features

9
00:00:28.576 --> 00:00:32.336
like iCloud or Game Center?

10
00:00:32.856 --> 00:00:35.056
Great, this session
is all about you.

11
00:00:35.056 --> 00:00:38.796
You want to get your system
and your projects configured

12
00:00:38.796 --> 00:00:43.166
for these tasks as quickly as
possible because at the end

13
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.966
of the day you want to spend
more time doing what it is

14
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.966
that you love, building
great products,

15
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:50.656
and spend less time
configuring things

16
00:00:50.686 --> 00:00:52.106
so you can begin that process.

17
00:00:53.356 --> 00:00:55.156
My name Joshua Pennington,

18
00:00:55.746 --> 00:00:58.896
I'm one of the Xcode engineering
managers and today I'm going

19
00:00:58.896 --> 00:01:02.136
to show you some of the changes
that we've made in Xcode 5

20
00:00:58.896 --> 00:01:02.136
to show you some of the changes
that we've made in Xcode 5

21
00:01:02.756 --> 00:01:05.186
that make it easy and
fast to get everything set

22
00:01:05.186 --> 00:01:07.776
up so you can spend
more time writing code

23
00:01:07.926 --> 00:01:10.436
and less time configuring
things like entitlements

24
00:01:10.436 --> 00:01:11.436
or provisioning profiles.

25
00:01:11.936 --> 00:01:14.626
We're going to cover
a few topics today.

26
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:18.116
We're going to start out by
talking about signing assets.

27
00:01:19.186 --> 00:01:22.246
When you develop apps for Apple
platforms, you need to sign them

28
00:01:22.246 --> 00:01:25.176
and there are a few things that
you need in order to do so.

29
00:01:25.226 --> 00:01:29.816
After that we're going to
talk about some of the changes

30
00:01:29.816 --> 00:01:32.926
that we've made in Xcode
5 regarding how we use

31
00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:35.206
and manage your Apple
ID accounts.

32
00:01:35.246 --> 00:01:40.056
After that we'll talk about some
of the changes that we've made

33
00:01:40.056 --> 00:01:42.376
in the project editor
that makes getting set

34
00:01:42.376 --> 00:01:44.466
up to use platform
features like iCloud

35
00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:47.656
or Game Center really easy,
especially when it comes

36
00:01:47.656 --> 00:01:49.086
to setting up entitlements.

37
00:01:49.896 --> 00:01:52.106
We're also going to show
you some of the changes

38
00:01:52.106 --> 00:01:54.206
that we've made to the
distribution workflow

39
00:01:54.406 --> 00:01:56.066
that makes it easier
to get your products

40
00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:58.426
into iTunes Connect
for App review.

41
00:01:58.516 --> 00:02:02.586
And after that we're
going to talk about some

42
00:01:58.516 --> 00:02:02.586
And after that we're
going to talk about some

43
00:02:02.586 --> 00:02:04.106
of the advancements
that we've made

44
00:02:04.156 --> 00:02:06.536
in troubleshooting issues
involving code signing

45
00:02:06.896 --> 00:02:07.556
and entitlements.

46
00:02:08.976 --> 00:02:12.356
Xcode 5 makes it easy
to identify, diagnose

47
00:02:12.356 --> 00:02:16.126
and fix problems in these
areas entirely within Xcode,

48
00:02:16.126 --> 00:02:19.826
so that's what we're
going to cover today.

49
00:02:20.636 --> 00:02:25.406
Let's get started by
talking about signing.

50
00:02:25.556 --> 00:02:26.686
Why do you need to
sign your code?

51
00:02:26.796 --> 00:02:33.066
Well, if you want to run an app
on an iOS device that app has

52
00:02:33.066 --> 00:02:35.396
to be signed with an
Apple issued certificate

53
00:02:36.166 --> 00:02:38.446
or the application will
not install or launch.

54
00:02:39.816 --> 00:02:43.776
Similarly if you're building a
Mac app that's taking advantage

55
00:02:43.776 --> 00:02:47.876
of services like iCloud or Game
Center, for your app to connect

56
00:02:47.946 --> 00:02:50.246
to the different daemons
in order to do that,

57
00:02:50.246 --> 00:02:51.596
you have to have your app signed

58
00:02:51.596 --> 00:02:52.896
and include the correct
entitlements.

59
00:02:52.896 --> 00:02:56.286
And of course when it comes time

60
00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:58.946
to distribute your
application you need to sign

61
00:02:58.946 --> 00:03:01.046
that with your distribution
signing identity.

62
00:02:58.946 --> 00:03:01.046
that with your distribution
signing identity.

63
00:03:02.376 --> 00:03:04.096
So if you want to
do these things,

64
00:03:04.236 --> 00:03:05.136
you need to sign your code.

65
00:03:05.136 --> 00:03:08.706
And there are a few things that
you need in order to do so.

66
00:03:10.506 --> 00:03:13.556
There are two signing assets
that you need in order

67
00:03:13.556 --> 00:03:14.596
to sign your application.

68
00:03:15.796 --> 00:03:18.356
The first asset is
a signing identity.

69
00:03:19.146 --> 00:03:23.236
A signing identity means a
certificate and the private key

70
00:03:23.236 --> 00:03:24.186
that goes along with it.

71
00:03:24.286 --> 00:03:27.226
I'm not going to
go into the details

72
00:03:27.226 --> 00:03:29.156
of public-private
key cryptography

73
00:03:29.156 --> 00:03:32.546
or what code sign
does under the hood.

74
00:03:32.646 --> 00:03:34.816
But for the purpose of this
session, you just need to know

75
00:03:34.816 --> 00:03:36.416
that you have to
have the private key

76
00:03:36.826 --> 00:03:40.466
and the Apple issued certificate
in order to sign your app.

77
00:03:40.706 --> 00:03:43.756
So that's the first asset that
you need, a signing identity.

78
00:03:44.556 --> 00:03:47.896
After that you need a
provisioning profile.

79
00:03:48.886 --> 00:03:50.836
A provisioning profile
is a document

80
00:03:50.836 --> 00:03:53.866
that outlines a few details
about your application

81
00:03:53.916 --> 00:03:58.186
and it contains the following:
an App ID that will be matched

82
00:03:58.186 --> 00:04:00.906
against the bundle ID of the
application that includes it.

83
00:03:58.186 --> 00:04:00.906
against the bundle ID of the
application that includes it.

84
00:04:01.606 --> 00:04:04.016
If this doesn't match what's
in the app's bundle ID,

85
00:04:04.016 --> 00:04:05.416
it's not going to launch.

86
00:04:06.816 --> 00:04:09.366
You can include a wildcard
in your provisioning profile

87
00:04:09.476 --> 00:04:12.146
so you can use the same
profile from multiple apps

88
00:04:12.196 --> 00:04:13.126
that your team develops.

89
00:04:13.666 --> 00:04:18.636
A profile also includes a list
of devices that are authorized

90
00:04:18.636 --> 00:04:19.555
to run the application.

91
00:04:20.206 --> 00:04:21.946
If your device is
not in this list,

92
00:04:22.196 --> 00:04:23.816
the app will not
install or launch.

93
00:04:25.096 --> 00:04:28.496
It also includes a list of
certificates that may be used

94
00:04:28.496 --> 00:04:30.306
in conjunction with the
provisioning profile.

95
00:04:30.306 --> 00:04:34.496
And finally it contains a
whitelist of entitlements.

96
00:04:35.276 --> 00:04:37.826
At runtime, any entitlements
that are

97
00:04:37.826 --> 00:04:40.516
in your application will be
validated against the ones

98
00:04:40.516 --> 00:04:41.716
in the provisioning profile.

99
00:04:42.616 --> 00:04:45.166
So if you include an entitlement
in your app that isn't

100
00:04:45.166 --> 00:04:48.226
in your profile, your app
will not install or launch.

101
00:04:49.516 --> 00:04:52.956
So those are the two signing
assets that you need in order

102
00:04:53.266 --> 00:04:54.286
to sign your applications.

103
00:04:55.496 --> 00:04:58.606
Where do you get them?

104
00:04:58.806 --> 00:05:01.706
The first step is to join
an Apple Developer Program.

105
00:04:58.806 --> 00:05:01.706
The first step is to join
an Apple Developer Program.

106
00:05:02.056 --> 00:05:06.476
Apple has three developer
programs, iOS, Mac and Safari.

107
00:05:08.606 --> 00:05:11.446
Each one allows you to obtain
the signing assets required

108
00:05:11.916 --> 00:05:13.306
to build for those platforms.

109
00:05:13.996 --> 00:05:17.686
In the iOS and Mac Developer
Program begin the process

110
00:05:17.686 --> 00:05:20.276
of allowing you to submit
applications for review.

111
00:05:21.796 --> 00:05:25.646
Once you've joined the developer
program you'll have an Apple ID

112
00:05:25.646 --> 00:05:27.066
account that is associated

113
00:05:27.286 --> 00:05:29.366
with a development team
in the Member Center.

114
00:05:30.156 --> 00:05:32.576
This allows you to log
in to the Member Center

115
00:05:32.886 --> 00:05:34.856
where you can request
signing certificates

116
00:05:35.136 --> 00:05:36.336
and provisioning profiles.

117
00:05:37.246 --> 00:05:40.066
But really you should use
the integration Xcode has.

118
00:05:40.676 --> 00:05:43.026
Xcode has had integration
with the Member Center

119
00:05:43.026 --> 00:05:43.966
for some time now

120
00:05:43.966 --> 00:05:47.286
for automatically downloading
your signing assets,

121
00:05:47.906 --> 00:05:48.676
so you should use this.

122
00:05:49.676 --> 00:05:53.036
In Xcode 5, we've made a number
of changes to how this works,

123
00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:56.846
to make obtaining your signing
assets easier and faster

124
00:05:57.276 --> 00:05:59.146
and also to make it easier

125
00:05:59.146 --> 00:06:01.586
to diagnose problems
as they crop up.

126
00:05:59.146 --> 00:06:01.586
to diagnose problems
as they crop up.

127
00:06:02.256 --> 00:06:05.306
To begin telling you about
these changes, I'd like to talk

128
00:06:05.306 --> 00:06:07.026
about the changes
that we've made

129
00:06:07.026 --> 00:06:09.856
to how we use your Apple
ID accounts in Xcode.

130
00:06:12.116 --> 00:06:13.336
Who's seen this before?

131
00:06:15.646 --> 00:06:18.146
Yes. [chuckles] So this
is what we would show you

132
00:06:18.146 --> 00:06:20.776
in Xcode 4 whenever we
needed to authenticate

133
00:06:20.776 --> 00:06:21.576
with the Member Center.

134
00:06:22.366 --> 00:06:24.426
We'd ask you for the
username and password

135
00:06:24.886 --> 00:06:26.736
of the Apple ID account
that you use

136
00:06:26.736 --> 00:06:28.116
for your developer
program membership.

137
00:06:28.976 --> 00:06:32.076
And we would ask you for
this every single time.

138
00:06:32.176 --> 00:06:34.736
So if you use the
Member Center a lot

139
00:06:34.736 --> 00:06:37.246
in Xcode you would see this
sheet quite frequently.

140
00:06:38.966 --> 00:06:41.666
Also I know a lot of
you are contractors

141
00:06:41.666 --> 00:06:43.806
and may have multiple
Apple ID accounts.

142
00:06:44.176 --> 00:06:46.036
With this UI, it's
not always clear

143
00:06:46.036 --> 00:06:47.196
which account you should use

144
00:06:47.776 --> 00:06:50.186
and it isn't clear what
we're going to use that for.

145
00:06:51.106 --> 00:06:55.206
In Xcode 5 we have now dedicated
space in Xcode's preferences

146
00:06:55.526 --> 00:06:58.306
for managing all of the
account that you use in Xcode

147
00:06:58.306 --> 00:07:01.346
for your development
including Apple ID accounts.

148
00:06:58.306 --> 00:07:01.346
for your development
including Apple ID accounts.

149
00:07:01.856 --> 00:07:05.986
We make it really easy to add
accounts and to view details

150
00:07:05.986 --> 00:07:06.946
about that information.

151
00:07:07.506 --> 00:07:10.516
And once you've entered in an
account, we will not ask you

152
00:07:10.516 --> 00:07:11.576
for the password again.

153
00:07:12.446 --> 00:07:17.636
[applause] So I'd
like to show you some

154
00:07:17.636 --> 00:07:19.336
of these changes
instead of talking

155
00:07:19.336 --> 00:07:20.736
about them with a quick demo.

156
00:07:20.796 --> 00:07:23.346
I'm going to hop over
to my demo machine.

157
00:07:23.986 --> 00:07:26.956
So I've got a copy of Xcode here

158
00:07:27.396 --> 00:07:30.266
and to view the accounts
information I just go

159
00:07:30.266 --> 00:07:31.366
to Xcode's preferences.

160
00:07:32.246 --> 00:07:34.976
To do that I just click
Xcode in the Menu bar

161
00:07:35.066 --> 00:07:38.406
and choose Preferences.

162
00:07:38.526 --> 00:07:44.706
At this point you can see
that there are a few accounts

163
00:07:44.706 --> 00:07:46.066
that Xcode already knows about.

164
00:07:46.836 --> 00:07:48.826
These are some source
control repositories

165
00:07:49.286 --> 00:07:50.086
that I have entered in.

166
00:07:50.086 --> 00:07:55.776
To add an Apple ID account,
I just click the plus button

167
00:07:56.216 --> 00:08:02.326
in the Source list and
choice Add Apple ID.

168
00:07:56.216 --> 00:08:02.326
in the Source list and
choice Add Apple ID.

169
00:08:02.326 --> 00:08:04.246
I enter in the log
in information

170
00:08:04.246 --> 00:08:10.426
from my developer program
Apple ID, and choose Add.

171
00:08:10.426 --> 00:08:20.306
And now Xcode knows about that
account and will not ask me

172
00:08:20.686 --> 00:08:24.316
for the password again.

173
00:08:24.466 --> 00:08:26.566
You can see we display a
little bit of information

174
00:08:26.566 --> 00:08:28.476
about the account on
the right-hand side.

175
00:08:29.776 --> 00:08:32.626
The most important thing that
we display here is the list

176
00:08:32.626 --> 00:08:35.826
of the teams that this
account is a member of.

177
00:08:36.086 --> 00:08:38.606
Now, I know a lot of you
have individual memberships

178
00:08:38.716 --> 00:08:40.956
in the developer program so
you're probably thinking,

179
00:08:41.635 --> 00:08:42.676
"What's this development team?"

180
00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:46.176
Well, whenever, you join that
you have a team created for you.

181
00:08:46.266 --> 00:08:48.496
It's probably your name and it
will be listed here as well.

182
00:08:49.306 --> 00:08:51.876
For those of you who
have used your Apple ID

183
00:08:51.876 --> 00:08:55.486
to join multiple teams, you'll
see all the teams listed here

184
00:08:56.256 --> 00:08:58.956
and you also see the role
that your account plays.

185
00:09:00.226 --> 00:09:02.946
Each account in a development
team has a different role

186
00:09:02.946 --> 00:09:06.376
and the basic idea is there
are varying permission levels

187
00:09:06.376 --> 00:09:09.016
for the types of signing assets
that an account is allowed

188
00:09:09.016 --> 00:09:13.406
to create and assigning
roles allows you to do that.

189
00:09:13.656 --> 00:09:16.746
We also have some UI for
viewing the signing details

190
00:09:17.156 --> 00:09:19.936
about the varying signing
assets that you have for a team

191
00:09:19.936 --> 00:09:20.986
and you can get at that

192
00:09:20.986 --> 00:09:22.366
by clicking the View
Details button.

193
00:09:23.036 --> 00:09:24.656
We'll cover this later
on in this session.

194
00:09:26.436 --> 00:09:28.036
So that's how you
add an account.

195
00:09:28.786 --> 00:09:30.256
You can see it's
pretty straightforward,

196
00:09:30.866 --> 00:09:34.066
and the good news is if you've
used Xcode 4 in the past

197
00:09:34.376 --> 00:09:37.126
and you checked that saved in
keychain option on that log

198
00:09:37.126 --> 00:09:40.026
in sheet, will automatically
import those accounts here.

199
00:09:40.026 --> 00:09:43.876
So you don't even have
to add your account.

200
00:09:44.046 --> 00:09:46.436
Now, this UI is not just
about making it easier

201
00:09:46.436 --> 00:09:47.806
to manage multiple Apple IDs.

202
00:09:47.806 --> 00:09:50.386
We've also made it
easy to migrate

203
00:09:50.386 --> 00:09:51.756
to a new development machine.

204
00:09:54.576 --> 00:09:57.346
Right now it's pretty easy
to get into a situation

205
00:09:57.346 --> 00:10:00.126
where you can't build your apps
when you move to a new machine.

206
00:09:57.346 --> 00:10:00.126
where you can't build your apps
when you move to a new machine.

207
00:10:00.726 --> 00:10:02.556
You try to build and
you'll get an error about

208
00:10:02.746 --> 00:10:04.456
"No valid signing
identity found."

209
00:10:05.526 --> 00:10:07.496
What that means is
you probably forgot

210
00:10:07.496 --> 00:10:09.716
to bring your private key
along from your old machine

211
00:10:09.836 --> 00:10:11.876
to your new one and this is

212
00:10:11.876 --> 00:10:14.276
because Apple does not have
a copy of your private key,

213
00:10:14.616 --> 00:10:17.116
so you need to move it along
to any development machines

214
00:10:17.586 --> 00:10:19.636
as you change machines
to work on.

215
00:10:20.726 --> 00:10:23.446
And we wanted to make this
process really straight forward,

216
00:10:24.096 --> 00:10:26.896
and we also wanted to
bring along all the account

217
00:10:26.896 --> 00:10:28.256
information that we
have stored here.

218
00:10:28.916 --> 00:10:32.546
So it is now possible to export
all of the account information

219
00:10:32.546 --> 00:10:36.206
that Xcode has in the signing
assets that go along with them.

220
00:10:36.706 --> 00:10:38.356
So we'll take your
signing identities

221
00:10:38.766 --> 00:10:42.126
which include your private keys
and your provisioning profiles.

222
00:10:42.676 --> 00:10:44.196
We'll bundle that
up with the list

223
00:10:44.196 --> 00:10:47.146
of the accounts including
their username their passwords.

224
00:10:47.846 --> 00:10:50.426
We'll stash that in a single
password protected file

225
00:10:50.426 --> 00:10:54.006
that we then hand off to you
and you can take that file,

226
00:10:54.356 --> 00:10:57.256
airdrop it to your new
Mac, double click the file

227
00:10:57.256 --> 00:11:00.186
and Xcode will automatically
import the contains.

228
00:10:57.256 --> 00:11:00.186
and Xcode will automatically
import the contains.

229
00:11:01.256 --> 00:11:03.886
This means that you can hit
build in your new project,

230
00:11:04.346 --> 00:11:05.926
or rather your existing project,

231
00:11:06.276 --> 00:11:08.926
and get the exact same code
signing behavior that you had

232
00:11:08.926 --> 00:11:11.176
on your old machine and
in a matter of minutes.

233
00:11:11.176 --> 00:11:12.806
And this is really easy.

234
00:11:13.296 --> 00:11:16.296
To export your accounts, you
just click on the Gear button

235
00:11:16.436 --> 00:11:19.356
in the Source list and
choose export accounts.

236
00:11:20.916 --> 00:11:25.136
Type in filename and enter in
a password to secure the file,

237
00:11:25.136 --> 00:11:30.756
type it in again for
verification and choose save.

238
00:11:32.636 --> 00:11:36.256
And just like that Xcode has
now given me a developer profile

239
00:11:36.256 --> 00:11:38.406
that I can take to my
new machine and import.

240
00:11:39.356 --> 00:11:41.626
So you can see, it's really
straightforward to move

241
00:11:41.626 --> 00:11:44.336
to a new machine and
you can also use this

242
00:11:44.686 --> 00:11:46.216
to update your development
machines.

243
00:11:46.316 --> 00:11:47.996
If you get some new
signing identities,

244
00:11:47.996 --> 00:11:50.496
you can export your
accounts and reimport them

245
00:11:50.896 --> 00:11:53.546
in your other development
machines to make sure

246
00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:55.186
that your signing
identities are always

247
00:11:55.636 --> 00:11:57.256
in a current state
on each machine.

248
00:11:57.756 --> 00:12:02.696
So that's the account section
so I'll go back over to slides.

249
00:11:57.756 --> 00:12:02.696
So that's the account section
so I'll go back over to slides.

250
00:12:05.476 --> 00:12:09.086
And one thing to note here is
the accounts UI is not just

251
00:12:09.086 --> 00:12:10.856
about making it really
convenient

252
00:12:10.856 --> 00:12:12.096
to have multiple accounts

253
00:12:12.096 --> 00:12:14.696
or to view information
about those accounts.

254
00:12:16.206 --> 00:12:19.056
It's really the most visible
part of a number of changes

255
00:12:19.056 --> 00:12:21.166
that we've made throughout
Xcode's infrastructure

256
00:12:21.166 --> 00:12:24.776
for using your accounts and
for using your signing assets.

257
00:12:25.996 --> 00:12:29.056
This means that Xcode can give
you better error messages.

258
00:12:29.556 --> 00:12:32.156
Instead of saying, "no valid
signing identities found,"

259
00:12:32.476 --> 00:12:34.116
we can tell you your
private key is missing.

260
00:12:34.826 --> 00:12:36.146
One's actionable, one's not.

261
00:12:37.276 --> 00:12:39.276
[applause] Yeah, I'm pretty
excited about that too.

262
00:12:41.866 --> 00:12:44.026
This also means that we can
be helpful whenever your

263
00:12:44.026 --> 00:12:46.226
configuring your
project to take advantage

264
00:12:46.226 --> 00:12:48.016
of platform features
like iCloud.

265
00:12:48.316 --> 00:12:50.046
We'll set up your
provisioning profiles

266
00:12:50.046 --> 00:12:51.866
and all the other
details that you need

267
00:12:51.866 --> 00:12:53.646
so you can begin
writing your code.

268
00:12:54.396 --> 00:12:56.566
To give you a tour of the
changes that we've made

269
00:12:56.566 --> 00:12:59.316
in the project editor for this
I'd like to turn this stage

270
00:12:59.316 --> 00:13:00.556
over to my colleague
Itai [phonetic],

271
00:12:59.316 --> 00:13:00.556
over to my colleague
Itai [phonetic],

272
00:13:00.796 --> 00:13:01.886
who's going to show
you these things.

273
00:13:02.356 --> 00:13:02.656
Thank you.

274
00:13:03.156 --> 00:13:09.576
[ Applause ]

275
00:13:10.076 --> 00:13:12.076
>> Good morning everybody,

276
00:13:12.716 --> 00:13:15.336
as Joshua mentioned we've
added some great new features

277
00:13:15.336 --> 00:13:17.796
to the project editor
in Xcode 5.

278
00:13:18.146 --> 00:13:20.796
We want the tools to help you
configure your applications

279
00:13:20.796 --> 00:13:24.086
efficiently so that you can
devote more time to development.

280
00:13:24.086 --> 00:13:28.416
One of the areas that we've
focused on is capabilities.

281
00:13:29.246 --> 00:13:32.766
Capabilities are platform
features such as iCloud

282
00:13:32.766 --> 00:13:36.476
or Game Center that you can make
use of in your applications.

283
00:13:37.146 --> 00:13:39.826
These are often features that
make your apps more appealing

284
00:13:39.826 --> 00:13:42.556
or useful to your customers
so we want you to use them,

285
00:13:42.756 --> 00:13:45.116
and we want the tools to
make it easy to set them up.

286
00:13:45.966 --> 00:13:48.106
That said how many of you
have tried to take advantage

287
00:13:48.106 --> 00:13:50.156
of capabilities such
as iCloud in one

288
00:13:50.156 --> 00:13:51.496
of your applications
in the past?

289
00:13:51.836 --> 00:13:53.786
I see a few hands.

290
00:13:54.066 --> 00:13:56.846
If you've done so then you know
that the process for setting

291
00:13:56.846 --> 00:14:01.266
that up could often be complex,
time consuming, and error prone.

292
00:13:56.846 --> 00:14:01.266
that up could often be complex,
time consuming, and error prone.

293
00:14:02.006 --> 00:14:04.066
So let's take a look
at a few examples.

294
00:14:04.576 --> 00:14:06.816
When you want to set up iCloud

295
00:14:06.816 --> 00:14:09.096
in your application the first
thing you need to do is sign

296
00:14:09.096 --> 00:14:10.146
in to the Member Center

297
00:14:10.796 --> 00:14:13.516
and download a new provisioning
profile with iCloud enabled.

298
00:14:14.276 --> 00:14:15.926
Then you need to
hop back into Xcode,

299
00:14:16.166 --> 00:14:18.846
create an entitlements file
if you don't already have one

300
00:14:18.846 --> 00:14:21.676
and enter in the appropriate
iCloud specific entitlements.

301
00:14:22.906 --> 00:14:23.976
So that's just iCloud.

302
00:14:23.976 --> 00:14:24.956
What about Game Center?

303
00:14:25.516 --> 00:14:28.236
When you want to use Game Center
you need to follow a similar set

304
00:14:28.236 --> 00:14:29.976
of steps but the
details are different.

305
00:14:30.726 --> 00:14:33.066
You still need a provisioning
profile but now you also need

306
00:14:33.066 --> 00:14:35.896
to link in a framework and
maybe make some modifications

307
00:14:35.896 --> 00:14:38.346
to your info.plist.

308
00:14:38.506 --> 00:14:40.816
Maps integration and
in-app purchase come

309
00:14:40.816 --> 00:14:42.646
with another similar but
slightly different set

310
00:14:42.646 --> 00:14:45.076
of configuration steps
and these aren't even all

311
00:14:45.076 --> 00:14:46.646
of the capabilities
that you can make use

312
00:14:46.646 --> 00:14:48.216
of in your apps,
it's just a subset.

313
00:14:48.616 --> 00:14:51.676
Each one has its own unique
set of configuration steps.

314
00:14:51.926 --> 00:14:54.006
You need to perform
them all correctly.

315
00:14:54.586 --> 00:14:57.406
Now, none of this
is rocket science

316
00:14:57.406 --> 00:15:00.796
but as you might imagine the
more apps you develop the more

317
00:14:57.406 --> 00:15:00.796
but as you might imagine the
more apps you develop the more

318
00:15:00.796 --> 00:15:03.216
capabilities you take advantage
of, the more time you'll have

319
00:15:03.246 --> 00:15:05.666
to devote to these
configuration tasks.

320
00:15:06.606 --> 00:15:08.526
Not only that, but if
you make a mistake,

321
00:15:08.696 --> 00:15:10.806
your application may
not launch and you need

322
00:15:10.806 --> 00:15:12.916
to spend more time
debugging that issue.

323
00:15:14.046 --> 00:15:16.186
And keep in mind you
need to perform all

324
00:15:16.186 --> 00:15:19.176
of this configuration before
you can even write a single line

325
00:15:19.176 --> 00:15:21.836
of code to take advantage
of a capability.

326
00:15:22.556 --> 00:15:25.966
So won't it be great if instead
of you needing to fuss with all

327
00:15:25.966 --> 00:15:29.696
of these configuration details
all you had to do is tell Xcode

328
00:15:29.956 --> 00:15:33.786
which capabilities you intend
to use and Xcode took care

329
00:15:33.786 --> 00:15:35.066
of the configuration for you.

330
00:15:36.316 --> 00:15:38.526
Well, that's what the
capabilities tab does.

331
00:15:39.086 --> 00:15:40.986
This is what it looks like.

332
00:15:40.986 --> 00:15:44.486
As you can see, it's just a new
tab inside of the project editor

333
00:15:44.846 --> 00:15:47.266
and when you view it, it shows
you all of the capabilities

334
00:15:47.266 --> 00:15:49.366
that are available for
you to use in your apps.

335
00:15:50.666 --> 00:15:53.876
When you want to use one,
all you have to do is hit the

336
00:15:53.876 --> 00:15:57.366
On switch and Xcode
will perform all

337
00:15:57.366 --> 00:15:58.506
of the configuration for you.

338
00:15:58.506 --> 00:15:59.886
There are no additional steps.

339
00:16:01.386 --> 00:16:02.066
This-- [applause] Yeah.

340
00:16:05.836 --> 00:16:07.356
This configuration
includes things

341
00:16:07.356 --> 00:16:09.716
like configuration your
provisioning profiles

342
00:16:09.716 --> 00:16:11.486
and downloading them
from the Member Center,

343
00:16:12.066 --> 00:16:14.886
setting up entitlements,
modifying your info.plist,

344
00:16:14.996 --> 00:16:17.866
linking frameworks,
modifying build settings.

345
00:16:18.566 --> 00:16:19.756
There's no magic involve.

346
00:16:19.756 --> 00:16:22.076
Xcode performs all of the
same steps that you use

347
00:16:22.076 --> 00:16:23.156
to have to do manually.

348
00:16:23.716 --> 00:16:27.576
Now, taking the step back,
one of the really great things

349
00:16:27.576 --> 00:16:30.196
about this is that you
don't need to configure all

350
00:16:30.196 --> 00:16:33.046
of these small details in
different editors and Xcode

351
00:16:33.046 --> 00:16:34.606
or in the Member Center anymore.

352
00:16:35.546 --> 00:16:38.186
All you have to do is
tell Xcode that you intend

353
00:16:38.186 --> 00:16:40.176
to use the capability
by hitting the On switch

354
00:16:40.596 --> 00:16:42.876
and Xcode takes care
of the rest.

355
00:16:42.876 --> 00:16:44.466
It also remembers your intent.

356
00:16:45.026 --> 00:16:46.946
So if anything goes wrong
with your configuration

357
00:16:46.946 --> 00:16:49.356
in the future, Xcode
can help diagnose

358
00:16:49.356 --> 00:16:50.756
and resolve those
issues for you.

359
00:16:51.716 --> 00:16:53.676
We'll see more of how that
works a little bit later

360
00:16:53.676 --> 00:16:55.656
on in this session
but it's clear

361
00:16:55.656 --> 00:16:58.036
that the capabilities tab is
going to make it really simple

362
00:16:58.036 --> 00:17:01.686
for you to take advantage of
platform features in your apps.

363
00:16:58.036 --> 00:17:01.686
for you to take advantage of
platform features in your apps.

364
00:17:02.696 --> 00:17:04.576
Now I'd like to show this
to you on the demo machine

365
00:17:04.576 --> 00:17:06.366
but first I want
to show you a few

366
00:17:06.366 --> 00:17:08.556
of the other changes we've
made to project editor.

367
00:17:12.556 --> 00:17:15.455
We've taken the summary tab
and renamed it to General

368
00:17:15.886 --> 00:17:17.856
and we've also cleaned
up its user interface,

369
00:17:18.156 --> 00:17:21.376
added some new functionality
and focused specifically

370
00:17:21.376 --> 00:17:23.896
on the iOS App icons
and launch images UI.

371
00:17:24.876 --> 00:17:26.846
Here's what it used to
look like in Xcode 4.

372
00:17:27.836 --> 00:17:30.116
As you can see it's a little
cluttered and disorganized.

373
00:17:30.426 --> 00:17:33.746
It's not really easy to tell how
to use it, what you're supposed

374
00:17:33.746 --> 00:17:35.116
to do with those
images UIs [phonetic].

375
00:17:35.206 --> 00:17:37.876
It's not showing you image
UI for all of the App icons

376
00:17:37.876 --> 00:17:39.436
that you should provide
for your apps

377
00:17:39.436 --> 00:17:41.066
such as Spotlight
and Setting icons.

378
00:17:41.476 --> 00:17:43.996
And sometimes it also doesn't
show you the right information.

379
00:17:44.606 --> 00:17:47.296
For example this
application has App icons

380
00:17:47.996 --> 00:17:50.926
but the summary tab is
not showing them to me.

381
00:17:51.106 --> 00:17:53.636
So we wanted to provide you with
the better experience for this.

382
00:17:54.336 --> 00:17:56.926
In Xcode 5 we present you

383
00:17:56.926 --> 00:17:59.996
with a much simplier
streamlined table based view

384
00:18:00.236 --> 00:18:02.016
where each image that
you need to provide

385
00:18:02.016 --> 00:18:05.376
for you app is represented by a
row in the table and it's easy

386
00:18:05.376 --> 00:18:07.916
to tell which images you
specified and which are missing

387
00:18:07.916 --> 00:18:10.496
because Xcode shows you a
warning badge for the ones

388
00:18:10.496 --> 00:18:11.456
that you still need to add.

389
00:18:12.846 --> 00:18:14.246
When you're ready to
add one you just click

390
00:18:14.246 --> 00:18:15.446
on the file picker button

391
00:18:15.996 --> 00:18:18.266
and Xcode will show you a
familiar file picker sheet

392
00:18:18.396 --> 00:18:20.646
and you just choose the
image you want to use.

393
00:18:21.816 --> 00:18:24.646
In addition to streamlining
this, we've also built

394
00:18:24.646 --> 00:18:27.336
in support for the iOS app icons
and launch images you'll need

395
00:18:27.336 --> 00:18:29.866
to add when you start
building apps for iOS 7

396
00:18:29.866 --> 00:18:31.466
so you can just specify
those here.

397
00:18:31.886 --> 00:18:35.876
And finally we've also built
in support for asset catalogs.

398
00:18:36.766 --> 00:18:38.766
If you missed the "What's
New in Xcode 5" session

399
00:18:38.766 --> 00:18:42.056
from earlier this week, asset
catalogs are a great new feature

400
00:18:42.056 --> 00:18:45.326
in Xcode 5 that will help
you manage all of the images

401
00:18:45.326 --> 00:18:47.626
for your application
in one place.

402
00:18:48.896 --> 00:18:52.006
Xcode 5 comes with a
dedicated asset catalog editor

403
00:18:52.006 --> 00:18:55.096
which provides you with a very
nice streamlined environment

404
00:18:55.276 --> 00:18:58.556
for viewing and updating your
images including your App icons

405
00:18:58.556 --> 00:18:59.266
and launch images.

406
00:19:00.466 --> 00:19:03.486
It's a simple drag and drop
interface and you no longer need

407
00:19:03.486 --> 00:19:06.506
to remember all of the various
suffices that need to be added

408
00:19:06.506 --> 00:19:09.276
to launch images in order to
comply with a naming convention.

409
00:19:09.536 --> 00:19:11.416
You just need to drag in
the images you want to use.

410
00:19:12.546 --> 00:19:14.666
So when you're ready to make
use of an asset catalog,

411
00:19:14.946 --> 00:19:17.216
the general tab makes
it just one click away.

412
00:19:17.216 --> 00:19:20.026
You just have to click, click
the use asset catalog button

413
00:19:20.586 --> 00:19:22.956
and the general tab will
copy all of your app icons

414
00:19:22.956 --> 00:19:24.876
and launch images into
a new asset catalog.

415
00:19:26.086 --> 00:19:28.696
So let's take a look, let's
take a look at how that works.

416
00:19:31.426 --> 00:19:33.576
[applause] So here we are back
at Xcode's welcome screen,

417
00:19:34.106 --> 00:19:36.426
and one of the things we've
like to show you over the course

418
00:19:36.426 --> 00:19:38.736
of this session is how
Xcode makes it really easy

419
00:19:38.736 --> 00:19:41.696
to create a brand new
application, configure it

420
00:19:41.846 --> 00:19:44.216
and then eventually archive
and submit it to the App store.

421
00:19:44.816 --> 00:19:48.756
So I'm going to start off by
creating a new application.

422
00:19:48.756 --> 00:19:51.446
I'll do that by hitting the
Create A New Xcode Project

423
00:19:51.446 --> 00:19:53.916
button on the welcome window

424
00:19:54.576 --> 00:19:56.536
and then Xcode will show
me its template assistant.

425
00:19:57.876 --> 00:20:02.126
Xcode comes prepackaged with
a variety of starting points,

426
00:19:57.876 --> 00:20:02.126
Xcode comes prepackaged with
a variety of starting points,

427
00:20:02.126 --> 00:20:05.006
excuse me for various
types of products

428
00:20:05.066 --> 00:20:07.646
that you can build
including iOS applications.

429
00:20:07.926 --> 00:20:10.646
So, here we can see
the list of templates

430
00:20:10.646 --> 00:20:12.336
that Xcode comes
packaged with for iOS.

431
00:20:12.336 --> 00:20:15.136
And I can just choose
one and hit Next.

432
00:20:15.376 --> 00:20:17.506
In this case I'll choose
Master Detail Application.

433
00:20:18.356 --> 00:20:24.466
I'll give my App a name,
"Crazy notes", and hit Next.

434
00:20:24.466 --> 00:20:26.356
And I'll just put
this on the Desktop

435
00:20:26.816 --> 00:20:28.046
and I'll hit the Create button.

436
00:20:28.626 --> 00:20:32.386
Now, Xcode has created my
brand new iOS application.

437
00:20:33.386 --> 00:20:36.216
Now, by Default, Xcode
opens to the project editor

438
00:20:36.306 --> 00:20:40.046
for a new App, so that you can
immediately begin making project

439
00:20:40.106 --> 00:20:41.306
configuration changes.

440
00:20:42.166 --> 00:20:44.396
The first thing I'd like
to do is to enable my App

441
00:20:44.396 --> 00:20:46.386
to use iCloud because
I plan to use iCloud.

442
00:20:46.936 --> 00:20:49.746
So, to do that I'll click
on the Capabilities tab

443
00:20:49.746 --> 00:20:53.816
and I will see the same
interface that we saw

444
00:20:53.816 --> 00:20:54.926
in the slides a moment ago.

445
00:20:55.486 --> 00:20:57.986
Xcode shows me all
of the capabilities

446
00:20:57.986 --> 00:20:59.536
that are available
for use in my App.

447
00:21:00.786 --> 00:21:02.576
If I want to see more
information about one,

448
00:21:03.096 --> 00:21:05.976
all I have to do is click this
Disclosure Triangle by its name

449
00:21:06.216 --> 00:21:08.136
and Xcode will show me a
brief description of what

450
00:21:08.136 --> 00:21:10.186
that Capability does as long

451
00:21:10.186 --> 00:21:11.976
as the steps involved
and enabling it.

452
00:21:12.566 --> 00:21:15.946
So, as you can see, when I hit
the On switch to enable iCloud,

453
00:21:16.176 --> 00:21:18.446
Xcode is going to perform
the same tasks we saw

454
00:21:18.446 --> 00:21:19.416
in the slides earlier.

455
00:21:19.696 --> 00:21:21.506
It's going to sign in
to the Member Center

456
00:21:21.506 --> 00:21:24.136
and download a provisioning
profile and it's also going

457
00:21:24.136 --> 00:21:25.746
to update my entitlements.

458
00:21:26.436 --> 00:21:33.786
So, I want to use iCloud,
let's go ahead and turn it on.

459
00:21:33.886 --> 00:21:38.436
OK, now as I said earlier,
when enabling iCloud,

460
00:21:38.436 --> 00:21:40.426
Xcode needs to communicate
with the Member Center

461
00:21:40.426 --> 00:21:42.346
to download a provisioning
profile for me.

462
00:21:43.126 --> 00:21:45.836
So, the first thing, the key
piece of information it needs

463
00:21:45.836 --> 00:21:47.906
to know in order to
perform that task is

464
00:21:47.906 --> 00:21:50.466
which development
team I'd like to use.

465
00:21:51.496 --> 00:21:54.706
The Capabilities tab makes use
of the accounts integration

466
00:21:54.706 --> 00:21:57.836
that Joshua showed you
earlier, both when communicating

467
00:21:57.836 --> 00:22:00.586
with the Member Center and
also in showing you this list

468
00:21:57.836 --> 00:22:00.586
with the Member Center and
also in showing you this list

469
00:22:00.586 --> 00:22:02.136
of teams from which
you can choose.

470
00:22:02.256 --> 00:22:04.166
So, you don't need to
type in anything manually,

471
00:22:04.576 --> 00:22:06.636
we already know all of the
teams that you want to use

472
00:22:06.636 --> 00:22:10.906
because you specified
them in the account.

473
00:22:10.906 --> 00:22:12.976
So, I can simply select
a team from this list

474
00:22:13.296 --> 00:22:16.516
and one thing I should point out
is if I had multiple Apple IDs,

475
00:22:16.956 --> 00:22:18.786
I would see all of
those Apple IDs listed

476
00:22:18.786 --> 00:22:22.326
in this pop-up Menu along with
the teams that they belong to.

477
00:22:22.516 --> 00:22:25.736
But since we only have one Apple
ID, we're just showing the teams

478
00:22:25.736 --> 00:22:27.056
from that-- from that account.

479
00:22:27.646 --> 00:22:30.916
I'll choose the SDK tools
team and hit Choose.

480
00:22:32.276 --> 00:22:35.056
Now, Xcode won't ask me
development team again

481
00:22:35.056 --> 00:22:37.306
for this application, it's
going to remember my selection.

482
00:22:37.406 --> 00:22:40.236
So, if I enable any other
Capabilities, I won't be asked

483
00:22:40.316 --> 00:22:42.486
that again and I can change
it later if I want to.

484
00:22:42.486 --> 00:22:46.616
Once Xcode is done communicating
with the member center,

485
00:22:46.886 --> 00:22:48.946
we can see that it's
finished enabling iCloud.

486
00:22:49.806 --> 00:22:50.946
The steps at the bottom

487
00:22:50.946 --> 00:22:52.966
of the iCloud section
now have checkmarks next

488
00:22:52.966 --> 00:22:55.266
to them indicating that
Xcode completed those

489
00:22:55.266 --> 00:22:56.176
steps successfully.

490
00:22:57.636 --> 00:22:59.846
We can see here in the
project navigator for example

491
00:22:59.846 --> 00:23:01.636
that it's created a
new entitlements file

492
00:22:59.846 --> 00:23:01.636
that it's created a
new entitlements file

493
00:23:01.926 --> 00:23:03.756
with the iCloud entitlements
that I'll need.

494
00:23:04.366 --> 00:23:07.586
Now, there's also some
new UI that's appeared

495
00:23:07.586 --> 00:23:08.546
in the iCloud section.

496
00:23:09.216 --> 00:23:12.736
Some Capabilities have optional
features that you might want

497
00:23:12.736 --> 00:23:15.756
to configure yourself such
as using the key-value store

498
00:23:15.756 --> 00:23:19.996
for iCloud or specifying some
custom container identifiers.

499
00:23:21.016 --> 00:23:23.116
We show you interface

500
00:23:23.116 --> 00:23:25.566
for managing those options
right alongside the rest

501
00:23:25.566 --> 00:23:27.686
of the Capability so
that you can make all

502
00:23:27.686 --> 00:23:31.196
of your Capability configuration
changes in the Capabilities tab,

503
00:23:31.236 --> 00:23:32.666
you don't have to
go anywhere else.

504
00:23:33.966 --> 00:23:36.656
So, for example, if I want
to use the key-value store,

505
00:23:36.656 --> 00:23:39.026
I can just check the box

506
00:23:39.196 --> 00:23:42.216
and Xcode will modify my
entitlements file for me.

507
00:23:42.936 --> 00:23:45.236
Now, my App is fully
configured to use iCloud.

508
00:23:46.016 --> 00:23:48.296
You'll notice a few things
that I didn't have to do.

509
00:23:48.296 --> 00:23:50.236
I didn't have to sign
in to the Member Center

510
00:23:50.236 --> 00:23:51.726
and download a provisioning
profile.

511
00:23:51.726 --> 00:23:53.726
I didn't have to go
to Keychain Access.

512
00:23:53.726 --> 00:23:56.366
I didn't have to go to any
other editors in Xcode.

513
00:23:56.366 --> 00:23:58.366
I did everything I needed to do

514
00:23:58.366 --> 00:23:59.786
from within the Capabilities
tab.

515
00:24:00.306 --> 00:24:02.226
And my application
is actually ready

516
00:24:02.226 --> 00:24:03.576
to build and run on my device.

517
00:24:04.316 --> 00:24:07.356
So, I'm going to go ahead and
do that by hitting the Build

518
00:24:07.356 --> 00:24:09.116
and Run button in
Xcode's toolbar.

519
00:24:10.336 --> 00:24:12.576
And my device is locked,
so I'll unlock it first.

520
00:24:12.846 --> 00:24:15.646
And we'll try that again.

521
00:24:16.516 --> 00:24:19.626
Now, we can see that Xcode
is building my application.

522
00:24:19.866 --> 00:24:21.336
It's shipping it
over to my device

523
00:24:21.336 --> 00:24:23.396
and in a few moments
we'll see it launch.

524
00:24:23.396 --> 00:24:25.526
I'll just hold this
up, so we can see

525
00:24:25.526 --> 00:24:28.626
that it launches,
and there it goes.

526
00:24:28.796 --> 00:24:32.796
Screen turns white and that's
my new master detail application

527
00:24:32.796 --> 00:24:36.866
with iCloud enabled,
and it's launched.

528
00:24:37.366 --> 00:24:40.026
[ Applause ]

529
00:24:40.526 --> 00:24:43.416
Now, those of you who have
made use of the capabilities

530
00:24:43.416 --> 00:24:46.106
such as iCloud in the past might
recognize that as the point

531
00:24:46.106 --> 00:24:49.286
where if you made a mistake,
your app won't launch

532
00:24:49.286 --> 00:24:51.346
and you need to start
debugging entitlements issues.

533
00:24:52.116 --> 00:24:54.286
With the Capabilities tab,
that's the thing of the past,

534
00:24:54.536 --> 00:24:56.346
every thing's configured
correctly.

535
00:24:56.866 --> 00:24:59.086
So, your application
can immediately launch

536
00:24:59.136 --> 00:25:00.356
after you enable iCloud.

537
00:24:59.136 --> 00:25:00.356
after you enable iCloud.

538
00:25:00.356 --> 00:25:05.096
Now, let's go back to the
Capabilities tab and take a look

539
00:25:05.096 --> 00:25:07.006
at one of the other
Capabilities available here.

540
00:25:07.506 --> 00:25:11.886
There's a new feature in iOS
7 called "Background fetch"

541
00:25:11.886 --> 00:25:14.906
and I want my App to be able
to take advantage of that.

542
00:25:14.906 --> 00:25:16.466
So that it can download
information

543
00:25:16.466 --> 00:25:18.866
over the network while it's
running in the background.

544
00:25:19.616 --> 00:25:22.706
In order to enable that, I
would need to make modification

545
00:25:22.786 --> 00:25:23.926
to my info.plist file.

546
00:25:24.146 --> 00:25:25.576
And first, I'd probably
have to look

547
00:25:25.576 --> 00:25:28.566
up documentation explaining
what exactly I needed to do.

548
00:25:28.976 --> 00:25:30.466
So that takes a little
bit of time.

549
00:25:30.956 --> 00:25:32.716
With the Capabilities
tab, I don't have

550
00:25:32.776 --> 00:25:33.796
to do any of that anymore.

551
00:25:34.106 --> 00:25:36.836
All I have to do is enable
the Capability by hitting the

552
00:25:36.836 --> 00:25:42.236
On switch and then I can choose
the Background Fetch option.

553
00:25:42.786 --> 00:25:44.956
And we can see from
the list of steps below

554
00:25:44.956 --> 00:25:47.106
that Xcode has modified
my info.plist for me.

555
00:25:47.446 --> 00:25:49.556
So, I didn't have to look
up the documentation or go

556
00:25:49.556 --> 00:25:51.026
to any other editors in Xcode.

557
00:25:51.346 --> 00:25:53.796
And now, I can just start
writing my code to make use

558
00:25:53.796 --> 00:25:55.056
of Background Fetch on iCloud.

559
00:25:55.106 --> 00:25:57.796
I didn't have to
go anywhere else.

560
00:25:57.796 --> 00:25:59.916
I did everything from
the Capabilities tab.

561
00:26:00.286 --> 00:26:01.836
So, as I've shown you,

562
00:26:02.086 --> 00:26:05.326
the Capabilities tab makes it
really easy to take advantage

563
00:26:05.326 --> 00:26:07.336
of these platform
features, all you have

564
00:26:07.336 --> 00:26:08.716
to do is hit a single switch.

565
00:26:09.286 --> 00:26:15.196
Now, let's look at some of the
changes in the General tab.

566
00:26:17.456 --> 00:26:20.416
The first thing I'd like to
highlight is this team pop-up

567
00:26:20.416 --> 00:26:21.556
in the identity section.

568
00:26:22.656 --> 00:26:25.496
If I ever want to go back and
change the team that I selected

569
00:26:25.496 --> 00:26:27.076
when I enabled the Capability,

570
00:26:27.076 --> 00:26:28.726
I can do that from
this Pop-up button.

571
00:26:29.026 --> 00:26:31.706
All I have to do is choose a
different team and these shows

572
00:26:31.706 --> 00:26:33.256
that same list of
teams that we would see

573
00:26:33.256 --> 00:26:36.786
in the Accounts.prefPane or in
that sheets that came up earlier

574
00:26:36.786 --> 00:26:37.756
when we enabled iCloud.

575
00:26:38.266 --> 00:26:41.436
For now, I'll leave it with
the team I previously selected.

576
00:26:41.736 --> 00:26:45.996
Scrolling down a little,
we can see the new App icon

577
00:26:45.996 --> 00:26:48.116
in launch images UI that
we saw in the slides.

578
00:26:48.586 --> 00:26:50.316
And it's easy to
tell at a glance

579
00:26:50.316 --> 00:26:52.576
that I'm missing
some of my images.

580
00:26:52.576 --> 00:26:54.826
For example, my iPhone
non-retina image has a

581
00:26:54.826 --> 00:26:55.596
warning icon.

582
00:26:56.556 --> 00:26:59.816
When I'm ready to add it I
can just click the file picker

583
00:26:59.816 --> 00:27:02.606
button and Xcode will show me
a familiar file picker sheet

584
00:26:59.816 --> 00:27:02.606
button and Xcode will show me
a familiar file picker sheet

585
00:27:02.876 --> 00:27:05.086
that confuse any image
from within my project

586
00:27:05.086 --> 00:27:07.686
or from anywhere else
on my Mac and add it

587
00:27:07.686 --> 00:27:11.586
and that's all I need to do.

588
00:27:11.836 --> 00:27:14.126
In addition, you'll see there
are some rows in these tables

589
00:27:14.176 --> 00:27:16.266
for iOS 7 App icons
and launch images.

590
00:27:16.266 --> 00:27:18.116
So, you can just use the same UI

591
00:27:18.216 --> 00:27:21.226
to add those when
you adopt iOS7.

592
00:27:21.226 --> 00:27:24.186
And finally, as I
mentioned earlier,

593
00:27:24.646 --> 00:27:26.746
we also support asset
catalog migration.

594
00:27:27.226 --> 00:27:29.116
When you're ready to
migrate to asset catalogs

595
00:27:29.116 --> 00:27:31.126
for managing you App
icon and launch images,

596
00:27:31.636 --> 00:27:32.386
so that you don't have

597
00:27:32.386 --> 00:27:35.196
to remember those complicated
suffixes anymore, for example,

598
00:27:35.546 --> 00:27:38.956
all you have to do is click one
button, I'll do that right now.

599
00:27:38.956 --> 00:27:40.956
I'll click the Use
Asset Catalog button

600
00:27:42.076 --> 00:27:44.916
and Xcode will show me a
sheet informing me that it's

601
00:27:44.916 --> 00:27:48.606
about to create a new asset
catalog and then it's going

602
00:27:48.606 --> 00:27:51.316
to copy my existing App icons
and launch images to it.

603
00:27:51.716 --> 00:27:55.346
And when I hit the Migrate
button, Xcode will do just that.

604
00:27:58.756 --> 00:28:01.286
So, now we can see here
in the project navigator

605
00:27:58.756 --> 00:28:01.286
So, now we can see here
in the project navigator

606
00:28:01.286 --> 00:28:04.406
that Xcode has created an
asset catalog called "Images."

607
00:28:05.586 --> 00:28:08.446
And the tables that I used
to see in the App icons

608
00:28:08.446 --> 00:28:11.296
and launch images sections
are gone because my app icons

609
00:28:11.296 --> 00:28:13.436
and launch images are
now managed via the Asset

610
00:28:13.436 --> 00:28:14.416
Catalog Editor.

611
00:28:15.166 --> 00:28:17.686
So, when I'm ready to go look
at those or make some edits,

612
00:28:18.066 --> 00:28:19.816
I can either click
on the asset catalog

613
00:28:19.896 --> 00:28:21.046
in the project navigator.

614
00:28:21.046 --> 00:28:23.176
Or I can just click
on the arrow button

615
00:28:23.886 --> 00:28:27.076
and Xcode will navigate
directly to my asset catalog.

616
00:28:27.076 --> 00:28:29.486
And here, we can see a
brand new asset catalog,

617
00:28:29.736 --> 00:28:32.556
it's got the same app icons
and launch images that we used

618
00:28:32.556 --> 00:28:34.206
to see inside of
the project editor.

619
00:28:35.126 --> 00:28:37.066
They've just been copied
into the new asset catalog,

620
00:28:37.306 --> 00:28:40.266
I can view them, I can make
updates just using this drag

621
00:28:40.266 --> 00:28:41.166
and drop image UIs.

622
00:28:41.166 --> 00:28:45.046
And when I build and run
my app, Xcode's going

623
00:28:45.046 --> 00:28:48.086
to bundle those app icons and
launch images up with the rest

624
00:28:48.086 --> 00:28:51.156
of my application and iOS will
make use of them the same way

625
00:28:51.156 --> 00:28:52.686
that it always has,
so I don't have

626
00:28:52.726 --> 00:28:54.496
to do any additional
configuration.

627
00:28:54.956 --> 00:28:57.996
So, that's asset
catalog migration.

628
00:28:58.536 --> 00:29:00.726
Let's take a look
at the slides again.

629
00:28:58.536 --> 00:29:00.726
Let's take a look
at the slides again.

630
00:29:01.466 --> 00:29:06.616
So, I've just shown you how
the new project editor makes it

631
00:29:06.616 --> 00:29:09.446
really easy to configure
your application both

632
00:29:09.446 --> 00:29:11.356
to take advantage
of platform features

633
00:29:11.756 --> 00:29:14.096
and to make use of
asset catalogs.

634
00:29:15.836 --> 00:29:18.226
Once you're done creating
your app, configuring it,

635
00:29:18.856 --> 00:29:20.186
you have to write
the code of course.

636
00:29:20.786 --> 00:29:22.806
And then, you're
ready to archive it

637
00:29:22.806 --> 00:29:24.296
and submit it to the App Store.

638
00:29:25.546 --> 00:29:27.126
To show you how to do that,

639
00:29:27.126 --> 00:29:29.186
I'd like to invite my
colleague Clark on stage.

640
00:29:29.686 --> 00:29:36.206
[ Applause ]

641
00:29:36.706 --> 00:29:37.426
>> Good morning everyone.

642
00:29:39.846 --> 00:29:42.446
OK, so now that you've
got your App configured

643
00:29:42.446 --> 00:29:44.856
and you've written the code
and it's ready to be submitted

644
00:29:44.856 --> 00:29:47.586
to the store, what
do you need to do?

645
00:29:48.286 --> 00:29:51.446
The first step in this process
is to create an archive.

646
00:29:52.636 --> 00:29:55.036
Now, what is an archive
and why do I need one?

647
00:29:56.086 --> 00:30:00.306
Well, on a basic level, an
archive in Xcode is a bundle

648
00:29:56.086 --> 00:30:00.306
Well, on a basic level, an
archive in Xcode is a bundle

649
00:30:00.306 --> 00:30:02.776
that contains a built
copy of your application

650
00:30:03.416 --> 00:30:06.246
and the associated dSYM file.

651
00:30:07.116 --> 00:30:09.946
The application itself
is typically built

652
00:30:09.946 --> 00:30:11.576
with you development
signing identity.

653
00:30:11.646 --> 00:30:16.016
This is important because it
allows anyone in your team

654
00:30:16.016 --> 00:30:19.096
to create the archive
whether or not they're able

655
00:30:19.446 --> 00:30:22.656
to perform the final submission.

656
00:30:23.196 --> 00:30:26.746
Additionally the dSYM
file contains one

657
00:30:26.746 --> 00:30:28.856
that is essentially a
mapping table to map

658
00:30:29.096 --> 00:30:32.116
from the seemingly
arbitrary addresses you find

659
00:30:32.116 --> 00:30:35.306
in the crash log,
to useful locations

660
00:30:35.306 --> 00:30:36.296
within your source code.

661
00:30:37.366 --> 00:30:41.276
This allows you to quickly
track down the cause

662
00:30:41.276 --> 00:30:45.026
of the crash being reported.

663
00:30:45.026 --> 00:30:47.836
Archives are managed within
the organizer in Xcode.

664
00:30:48.796 --> 00:30:51.726
It's important to keep
around archives of any app

665
00:30:52.106 --> 00:30:55.676
that you distributed elsewhere,
whether that'd be to the store

666
00:30:55.676 --> 00:30:59.576
or to testers or even
within your organization.

667
00:30:59.576 --> 00:31:02.736
It's important because
you want to be able

668
00:30:59.576 --> 00:31:02.736
It's important because
you want to be able

669
00:31:02.736 --> 00:31:05.336
to symbolicate those crash
logs should they come in.

670
00:31:05.336 --> 00:31:09.356
And you need the exact build
of app that crashed along

671
00:31:09.356 --> 00:31:12.456
with the associated dSYM.

672
00:31:12.646 --> 00:31:16.616
Now for submitting the app
or distributing into others,

673
00:31:16.836 --> 00:31:20.256
all I need to do is select
the archive that I want

674
00:31:20.256 --> 00:31:23.466
to distribute in the organizer,
and click the Distribute button.

675
00:31:24.426 --> 00:31:31.996
Now when I go to upload my
app, to submit it to Apple

676
00:31:31.996 --> 00:31:39.926
for review, what Xcode will do
is take my archive, take the App

677
00:31:39.926 --> 00:31:41.966
from my archive, reassign it

678
00:31:42.696 --> 00:31:48.696
with the appropriate signing
identity, back it up as an IPA,

679
00:31:49.046 --> 00:31:51.906
and upload it to iTunes
connect where a series

680
00:31:51.906 --> 00:31:55.186
of automated validation
steps will be performed

681
00:31:55.186 --> 00:31:57.506
on it before it is sent
on to a human reviewer.

682
00:31:58.966 --> 00:32:00.226
Let's take a look at
what that looks like.

683
00:31:58.966 --> 00:32:00.226
Let's take a look at
what that looks like.

684
00:32:00.756 --> 00:32:03.116
So here we have the app
that Itai just created,

685
00:32:03.236 --> 00:32:05.826
and we're going to assume that
somebody's written the code

686
00:32:05.826 --> 00:32:08.966
in the past few minutes and
it's ready to be submitted.

687
00:32:09.776 --> 00:32:13.536
So I start this process,
by going to a product menu

688
00:32:14.346 --> 00:32:15.976
and choosing archives.

689
00:32:16.906 --> 00:32:19.546
So Xcode is building a
release configuration of my App

690
00:32:20.146 --> 00:32:22.566
and packaging up with
the associated symbols.

691
00:32:22.566 --> 00:32:26.216
And as you can see here, when
it's completed it shows up here

692
00:32:26.216 --> 00:32:30.426
in the organizer along with
previous iterations of the app

693
00:32:30.486 --> 00:32:31.516
that I've built before.

694
00:32:31.516 --> 00:32:34.546
As I said before it's
important to keep those around,

695
00:32:34.686 --> 00:32:37.466
should you receive crash logs
from those particular builds.

696
00:32:39.506 --> 00:32:42.986
In this case, I'm planning to
distribute this particular build

697
00:32:42.986 --> 00:32:46.726
of the app, so I select
that and click distribute.

698
00:32:47.046 --> 00:32:51.026
Now the options presented here
vary based on what's contained

699
00:32:51.026 --> 00:32:54.126
in the archive, which in
this case is an iOS app.

700
00:32:54.906 --> 00:32:57.816
I've given the option to
submit to the iOS app store,

701
00:32:58.866 --> 00:33:01.716
or I can save it out as an
IPA file which is useful

702
00:32:58.866 --> 00:33:01.716
or I can save it out as an
IPA file which is useful

703
00:33:01.716 --> 00:33:03.346
for distributing to testers,

704
00:33:03.346 --> 00:33:05.036
or for use with the
enterprise program.

705
00:33:06.146 --> 00:33:08.616
I can also export
the archive itself.

706
00:33:09.566 --> 00:33:11.676
This is important and useful

707
00:33:12.196 --> 00:33:14.256
when somebody else is
doing the final submission.

708
00:33:14.686 --> 00:33:16.856
As I mentioned before, anyone

709
00:33:16.856 --> 00:33:19.726
on your development team
can create the archive even

710
00:33:19.726 --> 00:33:22.256
if they don't have
the credentials needed

711
00:33:22.256 --> 00:33:23.716
to submit it to the store.

712
00:33:25.076 --> 00:33:27.236
In this case I'm
going to choose submit

713
00:33:27.236 --> 00:33:30.356
to the iOS app store
and click next.

714
00:33:31.886 --> 00:33:34.196
Xcode is communicating
with iTunes Connect,

715
00:33:34.676 --> 00:33:37.566
looking for any apps that are
in the state ready to upload.

716
00:33:38.256 --> 00:33:40.696
As you can see it's
found this particular app

717
00:33:41.346 --> 00:33:42.546
as it has noted here.

718
00:33:43.916 --> 00:33:47.046
Now what I need to do is choose
how I'm going to sign this app.

719
00:33:47.456 --> 00:33:51.716
In previous versions of Xcode,
this would be a relatively,

720
00:33:52.166 --> 00:33:54.736
shall we say, verbose menu.

721
00:33:55.036 --> 00:33:58.536
It would list practically all of
your provisioning profiles along

722
00:33:58.536 --> 00:34:00.416
with all those certificates
contained in them,

723
00:33:58.536 --> 00:34:00.416
with all those certificates
contained in them,

724
00:34:00.736 --> 00:34:02.406
even if they weren't
directly relevant.

725
00:34:03.206 --> 00:34:05.466
However, thanks to the new
accounts infrastructure,

726
00:34:06.596 --> 00:34:09.746
Xcode knows exactly who
you are and knows how

727
00:34:09.746 --> 00:34:12.525
to associate a specific
provisioning profile

728
00:34:12.565 --> 00:34:13.335
with the app.

729
00:34:13.516 --> 00:34:16.266
So it's only displaying the
relevant provisioning profile.

730
00:34:16.886 --> 00:34:18.746
So I would select that,

731
00:34:19.896 --> 00:34:21.386
and here's where I
would click submit

732
00:34:21.386 --> 00:34:22.476
to actually submit it to Apple.

733
00:34:22.956 --> 00:34:25.116
Of course this is just
a demo and I don't want

734
00:34:25.116 --> 00:34:30.016
to waste their time so I'm
going to cancel out of that.

735
00:34:30.606 --> 00:34:33.876
So we've shown you how easy it
is to configure your application

736
00:34:34.166 --> 00:34:38.306
and how simple everything is
when everything goes your way.

737
00:34:39.356 --> 00:34:42.036
However, what happens when
things don't quite go your way?

738
00:34:43.676 --> 00:34:45.626
There are many issues
that can happen

739
00:34:45.626 --> 00:34:48.366
in configuring your entitlements
or provisioning profiles,

740
00:34:48.746 --> 00:34:52.266
especially in versions of Xcode
before the Capabilities tab.

741
00:34:52.806 --> 00:34:53.846
One such example,

742
00:34:54.065 --> 00:34:55.956
it's a misconfiguration
in your entitlements.

743
00:34:57.025 --> 00:34:58.216
Now that may be as simple

744
00:34:58.216 --> 00:35:02.516
as the entitlements file is
just missing or it may be harder

745
00:34:58.216 --> 00:35:02.516
as the entitlements file is
just missing or it may be harder

746
00:35:02.516 --> 00:35:06.306
to diagnose issues such as a
typo in the name or the value

747
00:35:06.306 --> 00:35:07.436
of the particular entitlement.

748
00:35:09.116 --> 00:35:12.776
Other possible issues include
issues with your signing assets

749
00:35:14.486 --> 00:35:16.306
such as your signing identity,

750
00:35:16.386 --> 00:35:17.896
you may be missing
the private key,

751
00:35:18.296 --> 00:35:20.726
which is unfortunately
a fairly common issue,

752
00:35:20.726 --> 00:35:24.806
but it's is not always obvious
that the private key only lives

753
00:35:24.806 --> 00:35:27.976
on the machine that you used to
create it in the first place.

754
00:35:27.976 --> 00:35:29.006
It's never sent to Apple.

755
00:35:30.696 --> 00:35:34.196
Another possible issue is you
might be missing the appropriate

756
00:35:34.196 --> 00:35:35.256
provisioning profiles

757
00:35:36.016 --> 00:35:39.146
or the profile might not
specify the correct entitlement.

758
00:35:39.946 --> 00:35:43.206
Now to that point, I'm
going to talk a little bit

759
00:35:43.206 --> 00:35:45.496
about how entitlements
are controlled

760
00:35:45.496 --> 00:35:46.636
by provisioning profiles.

761
00:35:48.086 --> 00:35:51.516
Both your app by way of
your entitlements file

762
00:35:52.016 --> 00:35:54.646
and the provisioning profile
contain a list of entitlements.

763
00:35:56.676 --> 00:35:57.996
But the list of entitlements

764
00:35:58.146 --> 00:36:01.146
in the profile is
just the white list.

765
00:35:58.146 --> 00:36:01.146
in the profile is
just the white list.

766
00:36:01.276 --> 00:36:03.306
It's a list of allowed
entitlements

767
00:36:03.366 --> 00:36:05.346
that your app is allowed
to take advantage of.

768
00:36:06.686 --> 00:36:10.476
So if entitlement is
specified in your app

769
00:36:10.476 --> 00:36:12.846
and the profile, that's fine.

770
00:36:12.846 --> 00:36:15.526
You can use that entitlement,
the OS will let your app launch.

771
00:36:16.116 --> 00:36:19.566
However, if your app specifies
an entitlement that's not

772
00:36:19.566 --> 00:36:22.496
in the profile, your app
won't be able to launch.

773
00:36:23.736 --> 00:36:26.236
And more importantly the
error message you're given

774
00:36:26.236 --> 00:36:29.896
in that case is shall
we say slightly opaque.

775
00:36:31.096 --> 00:36:35.276
It's not always obvious what
the problem is or how to fix it.

776
00:36:36.976 --> 00:36:41.696
Well, in the capability's
tab, remember the steps

777
00:36:41.696 --> 00:36:45.716
that Itai showed you earlier,
Xcode remembers those steps too.

778
00:36:46.516 --> 00:36:49.246
And it's constantly
validating that the work

779
00:36:49.246 --> 00:36:51.056
for those steps does
not come undone.

780
00:36:52.076 --> 00:36:56.766
In this case you can see
the entitlement is missing

781
00:36:56.766 --> 00:36:58.966
from my entitlements file.

782
00:36:59.736 --> 00:37:02.336
Xcode knows that, it
knows exactly what's wrong

783
00:36:59.736 --> 00:37:02.336
Xcode knows that, it
knows exactly what's wrong

784
00:37:02.556 --> 00:37:06.936
and more importantly it
knows exactly how to fix it.

785
00:37:06.936 --> 00:37:09.926
And so it presents this App
we named, Fix Issue button.

786
00:37:12.406 --> 00:37:14.556
Likewise, in the General tab,

787
00:37:15.906 --> 00:37:18.026
we show issues relating
your signing identities,

788
00:37:18.026 --> 00:37:21.606
such as your signing assets,
such as your signing identity

789
00:37:21.606 --> 00:37:22.866
or your provisioning profile.

790
00:37:24.116 --> 00:37:26.126
Again this is a problem
that would prevent you

791
00:37:26.126 --> 00:37:29.086
from building you running or
running your app in the past

792
00:37:29.516 --> 00:37:31.436
that it may not have been
obvious what the actual

793
00:37:31.516 --> 00:37:32.166
problem was.

794
00:37:33.136 --> 00:37:35.446
In this case, we know
exactly what's wrong.

795
00:37:36.496 --> 00:37:37.716
I'm missing my private key.

796
00:37:39.046 --> 00:37:40.446
Additionally, I'm presented

797
00:37:40.516 --> 00:37:42.636
with the two options
to fix this problem.

798
00:37:43.526 --> 00:37:45.556
If I still have access
in the machine

799
00:37:45.666 --> 00:37:47.726
on which I generated the
key in the first place,

800
00:37:48.896 --> 00:37:52.346
I can go to that machine,
use the export functionality

801
00:37:52.346 --> 00:37:55.726
that Joshua showed you
earlier in the accounts pane,

802
00:37:55.726 --> 00:37:58.056
and import it here using
the button on the left.

803
00:37:59.426 --> 00:38:02.366
Alternatively, if I no longer
have access to that machine,

804
00:37:59.426 --> 00:38:02.366
Alternatively, if I no longer
have access to that machine,

805
00:38:02.926 --> 00:38:06.886
I revoke my identity and request
a new one using the button

806
00:38:06.886 --> 00:38:07.336
on the right.

807
00:38:08.316 --> 00:38:12.686
Again, Xcode knows exactly what
the problem is and how to fix it

808
00:38:13.106 --> 00:38:16.666
and presents a simple way
for you to enact that fix.

809
00:38:17.956 --> 00:38:22.206
Now I'm going to show a little
about what this looks like.

810
00:38:22.296 --> 00:38:27.116
So here I have an old iCloud app

811
00:38:27.846 --> 00:38:29.536
that I haven't quite
configured correctly.

812
00:38:30.376 --> 00:38:34.816
In this case, again I'm missing
the appropriate entitlement

813
00:38:34.926 --> 00:38:36.006
in my entitlements file.

814
00:38:37.416 --> 00:38:39.846
Now previous versions of
Xcode, I would be able

815
00:38:39.846 --> 00:38:42.436
to build this app just
fine, it will build,

816
00:38:42.436 --> 00:38:44.426
there'd be no warnings,
no errors.

817
00:38:45.026 --> 00:38:47.656
But when I were to run it,
I would get an obscure error

818
00:38:47.846 --> 00:38:52.516
that frankly without being
someone who works at Apple,

819
00:38:52.666 --> 00:38:55.136
I might not have any way to
understand what's going on.

820
00:38:55.836 --> 00:38:59.976
But in this case it knows
what's wrong, how to fix it

821
00:39:00.246 --> 00:39:02.136
and gives me this button.

822
00:39:03.576 --> 00:39:06.336
That's all it took.

823
00:39:06.836 --> 00:39:11.296
[ Applause ]

824
00:39:11.796 --> 00:39:15.126
Now what used to mean hours
of searching documentation

825
00:39:15.186 --> 00:39:19.216
for obscure error codes or
trying out help forums online,

826
00:39:19.816 --> 00:39:22.006
has been reduced to a
single button click.

827
00:39:23.756 --> 00:39:26.966
Likewise another common
issue, unfortunately,

828
00:39:26.966 --> 00:39:30.826
all too common is the
missing private key issue

829
00:39:31.086 --> 00:39:32.526
that I'd showed you
before in the slides.

830
00:39:33.586 --> 00:39:37.976
Again Xcode knows exactly
what's wrong, and exactly how

831
00:39:37.976 --> 00:39:40.026
to fix it, in this case
there are two options.

832
00:39:40.946 --> 00:39:42.866
And as I described before,

833
00:39:42.866 --> 00:39:45.716
I can either import
the developer profile

834
00:39:45.836 --> 00:39:49.726
from my original machine
or I can revoke my identity

835
00:39:49.726 --> 00:39:51.086
and request a new one.

836
00:39:52.916 --> 00:39:57.076
Now we think that the trouble
shooting capabilities offered

837
00:39:57.166 --> 00:39:59.446
here in the General
and Capabilities tab,

838
00:39:59.946 --> 00:40:02.336
will be sufficient for
diagnosing and fixing,

839
00:39:59.946 --> 00:40:02.336
will be sufficient for
diagnosing and fixing,

840
00:40:02.336 --> 00:40:04.166
just about any issue
you're going to find

841
00:40:04.456 --> 00:40:06.656
with your entitlements or
your signing credentials.

842
00:40:07.656 --> 00:40:10.346
But for those of you who
are the type who need

843
00:40:10.386 --> 00:40:12.556
to know a little more
about what's going

844
00:40:12.556 --> 00:40:15.116
on with the signing
credentials in your team,

845
00:40:15.366 --> 00:40:17.196
we offer the team detail sheet.

846
00:40:18.126 --> 00:40:21.596
I'm going to go back
to preferences,

847
00:40:21.956 --> 00:40:23.076
back to the accounts pane,

848
00:40:24.166 --> 00:40:25.666
select the account
I'm interested in

849
00:40:25.666 --> 00:40:29.466
and the team I'm interested
in, and click View Details.

850
00:40:30.056 --> 00:40:33.916
Now this sheet displays
two important classes

851
00:40:34.046 --> 00:40:34.626
of information.

852
00:40:35.706 --> 00:40:39.116
In the upper table, I see the
signing identities for this team

853
00:40:39.246 --> 00:40:41.816
that are currently installed
in my key chain on this map.

854
00:40:44.616 --> 00:40:49.566
It displays each identity
along with the platform

855
00:40:49.746 --> 00:40:50.976
and some important status.

856
00:40:51.696 --> 00:40:55.626
Should any of my keys be
expired, revoked, missing,

857
00:40:56.076 --> 00:40:57.626
that status will show up here.

858
00:40:58.606 --> 00:40:59.956
Should I have such a problem,

859
00:41:00.306 --> 00:41:03.006
I can quickly request
a new signing identity

860
00:41:03.486 --> 00:41:06.956
by clicking the plus button and
choosing the type of identity

861
00:41:07.106 --> 00:41:10.336
that I wish to request.

862
00:41:11.196 --> 00:41:14.606
Additionally, even though we
have the ability to export all

863
00:41:14.606 --> 00:41:18.046
of your account info and all of
your signing credentials and all

864
00:41:18.046 --> 00:41:21.116
of your provisioning profiles,
that's not always appropriate.

865
00:41:21.816 --> 00:41:22.736
Sometimes you just need

866
00:41:22.736 --> 00:41:26.226
to export a single signing
identity, perhaps you want

867
00:41:26.226 --> 00:41:29.816
to have someone else say a
build engineer build as you

868
00:41:29.816 --> 00:41:30.796
for the final submission.

869
00:41:32.496 --> 00:41:35.386
That's easily done by selecting
the identity you're interested

870
00:41:35.516 --> 00:41:38.586
in and choosing export
from the gear menu.

871
00:41:40.096 --> 00:41:50.436
As before I give it a name--
[pause] password and click Save.

872
00:41:51.546 --> 00:41:54.416
Now Xcode has taken that
identity and saved it

873
00:41:54.416 --> 00:41:58.216
as an encrypted P12 file that I
can give to that build engineer

874
00:41:58.346 --> 00:41:59.976
to have them build as me.

875
00:42:00.436 --> 00:42:03.226
And I didn't have to give them
any of my log-in credentials,

876
00:42:03.546 --> 00:42:06.156
any of the additional signing
identities or profiles.

877
00:42:06.656 --> 00:42:09.106
I just exported the
individual item

878
00:42:09.106 --> 00:42:10.246
that I needed to care about.

879
00:42:14.086 --> 00:42:17.926
Likewise, should you need to
revoke a signing identity,

880
00:42:17.926 --> 00:42:19.316
you can do that from
here as well.

881
00:42:19.686 --> 00:42:23.556
Again, select the identity you
care about and choose revoke

882
00:42:23.556 --> 00:42:25.876
from the gear menu, all this

883
00:42:25.876 --> 00:42:29.726
without ever touching Keychain
Access or needing to deal

884
00:42:29.726 --> 00:42:31.416
with the Member Center.

885
00:42:32.556 --> 00:42:35.946
The lower part of the
sheet displays all

886
00:42:35.946 --> 00:42:37.816
of the provisioning
profiles from this team

887
00:42:38.176 --> 00:42:39.486
that I have locally on this Mac.

888
00:42:40.406 --> 00:42:44.096
As well as important information
about them, such as their name,

889
00:42:44.316 --> 00:42:46.586
when they expire
and most importantly

890
00:42:46.746 --> 00:42:50.566
which entitlements
are allowed by each.

891
00:42:50.816 --> 00:42:53.216
And should I want to make sure
that I have the latest version

892
00:42:53.216 --> 00:42:55.256
of this information
and the latest version

893
00:42:55.256 --> 00:42:58.466
of all the profiles, I can
refresh the Member Center

894
00:42:59.006 --> 00:43:00.336
by clicking this button here.

895
00:42:59.006 --> 00:43:00.336
by clicking this button here.

896
00:43:00.836 --> 00:43:04.856
[ Pause ]

897
00:43:05.356 --> 00:43:13.466
So today we've shown you
some of the new features

898
00:43:13.466 --> 00:43:17.646
in Xcode dealing with managing
your signing assets, as well as,

899
00:43:17.646 --> 00:43:19.266
managing your Apple ID accounts.

900
00:43:20.366 --> 00:43:23.046
We've also shown you how
easy it is in Xcode 5

901
00:43:23.136 --> 00:43:25.556
to configure your
application, to take advantage

902
00:43:25.556 --> 00:43:28.956
of platform features without
needing to know the details

903
00:43:28.956 --> 00:43:31.316
about what needs to be
done for each feature.

904
00:43:32.966 --> 00:43:35.926
We've also shown you the
process for submitting your App

905
00:43:35.926 --> 00:43:37.476
to the App store and
actually getting it

906
00:43:37.476 --> 00:43:38.486
out there to your customers.

907
00:43:41.406 --> 00:43:43.046
Most importantly in my opinion,

908
00:43:43.136 --> 00:43:45.586
we've shown you the
changes we've made in Xcode,

909
00:43:45.676 --> 00:43:48.016
thanks to the account
infrastructure

910
00:43:48.696 --> 00:43:52.826
that we can now diagnose
and troubleshoot most

911
00:43:52.826 --> 00:43:56.696
of the common issues that
plague many of you today.

912
00:43:59.746 --> 00:44:01.456
If you've got additional
questions,

913
00:43:59.746 --> 00:44:01.456
If you've got additional
questions,

914
00:44:01.756 --> 00:44:03.656
feel free to e-mail
our Evangelist

915
00:44:05.076 --> 00:44:09.346
and if you're interested in
the gritty details of what goes

916
00:44:09.576 --> 00:44:12.536
on when you codesign your
app, you can go to this link,

917
00:44:12.916 --> 00:44:14.566
if you can type very quickly.

918
00:44:15.626 --> 00:44:17.686
You also might be interested
in going to these session,

919
00:44:18.866 --> 00:44:23.006
held later today after lunch,
it's a guide to what goes

920
00:44:23.006 --> 00:44:31.306
on when you sandbox your
App, and have a nice lunch.

921
