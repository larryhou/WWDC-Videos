>> Mike Stern: Good
morning everyone.

[ Applause ]

4
00:00:18.876 --> 00:00:20.186
My name is Mike Stern.

5
00:00:20.336 --> 00:00:24.676
I'm Apple's User Experience
Evangelist and I'm really happy

6
00:00:24.676 --> 00:00:27.996
to be talking again today
about design for iOS.

7
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.796
Now, if you saw my
talk on Wednesday,

8
00:00:31.256 --> 00:00:33.066
you heard me speak a
lot about the difference

9
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.326
between iOS 6 and iOS 7.

10
00:00:35.726 --> 00:00:39.776
Well today, we're going talk
about Evergreen Design advice.

11
00:00:40.636 --> 00:00:44.486
So this is advice that is
relevant if you're making an app

12
00:00:44.536 --> 00:00:48.506
for iOS 7 but it was
relevant for 6 and 5

13
00:00:48.576 --> 00:00:53.326
and every version
of iOS before that.

14
00:00:53.506 --> 00:00:57.326
So, as many of you know,
we spend a lot of time

15
00:00:57.326 --> 00:01:00.616
and energy creating
apps at Apple.

16
00:00:57.326 --> 00:01:00.616
and energy creating
apps at Apple.

17
00:01:00.916 --> 00:01:02.806
We focus on it, we
want to make sure

18
00:01:02.806 --> 00:01:06.196
that user experience
is really fantastic.

19
00:01:07.636 --> 00:01:11.866
And I've been a designer at
Apple for seven years and I know

20
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:15.486
at first hand how much care and
thought goes into the design

21
00:01:15.486 --> 00:01:18.186
of each one of our
apps, and it shows.

22
00:01:19.426 --> 00:01:24.306
Our users have come to expect
experiences that are intuitive,

23
00:01:25.836 --> 00:01:33.516
engaging, beautiful, and
sometimes a bit magical.

24
00:01:38.076 --> 00:01:41.766
And you guys heard all week long
about the great new technologies

25
00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:44.416
that you could take advantage
of for designing your apps.

26
00:01:45.626 --> 00:01:48.356
And I hope you guys learned
a lot and have come away

27
00:01:48.356 --> 00:01:51.086
from this week really inspired
to try some of these new things.

28
00:01:51.946 --> 00:01:53.596
But the thing I want
to remind you of is

29
00:01:53.596 --> 00:01:56.936
that your users aren't going
to judge your apps based

30
00:01:56.936 --> 00:02:01.956
on how many technologies you use
or how many APIs you integrated

31
00:01:56.936 --> 00:02:01.956
on how many technologies you use
or how many APIs you integrated

32
00:02:02.336 --> 00:02:03.756
or how elegant your code is.

33
00:02:04.906 --> 00:02:07.256
The way they're going to
judge your app is based

34
00:02:07.256 --> 00:02:11.526
on what enables them to
do, how it makes them feel.

35
00:02:12.106 --> 00:02:16.016
So with that in mind, it's
really important that the design

36
00:02:16.016 --> 00:02:20.006
of your app has the same
qualities of being intuitive

37
00:02:20.546 --> 00:02:22.396
and engaging and beautiful.

38
00:02:22.926 --> 00:02:27.436
And we saw on Monday,
some of the winners

39
00:02:27.436 --> 00:02:34.346
of the Apple Design Awards, apps
like ProCreate, WWF Together,

40
00:02:34.556 --> 00:02:37.676
Ridiculous Fishing,
Badland, Yahoo!

41
00:02:37.676 --> 00:02:39.186
Weather, and Letterpress.

42
00:02:39.876 --> 00:02:45.566
These apps, they set the bar for
high quality user experience.

43
00:02:46.716 --> 00:02:51.266
I worked on this a little
bit and I got to see dozens,

44
00:02:51.626 --> 00:02:54.206
hundreds of apps
that we considered

45
00:02:55.096 --> 00:02:58.166
for the final selection and
it was a really tough choice.

46
00:02:58.446 --> 00:03:01.156
There's so many great apps
being designed for iOS,

47
00:02:58.446 --> 00:03:01.156
There's so many great apps
being designed for iOS,

48
00:03:01.946 --> 00:03:03.576
many of them only for iOS.

49
00:03:03.906 --> 00:03:08.056
But this is tough competition.

50
00:03:08.576 --> 00:03:09.546
So how do you get here?

51
00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:11.666
How do you start going
in this direction?

52
00:03:14.436 --> 00:03:20.256
Now, I look at a lot of apps
all the time and I see some

53
00:03:20.256 --> 00:03:22.766
of the same mistakes being
made over and over again.

54
00:03:24.166 --> 00:03:27.446
And as we know, a lot
of apps get rejected

55
00:03:27.556 --> 00:03:30.026
from the App Store
during the review process.

56
00:03:30.566 --> 00:03:35.676
In fact, it's one of the top
three reasons why apps get

57
00:03:35.676 --> 00:03:37.646
rejected-- why apps
will get rejected.

58
00:03:38.576 --> 00:03:40.306
So, I'd like to head
that off at the pass,

59
00:03:40.936 --> 00:03:43.806
try to provide some advice
to streamline the process

60
00:03:43.866 --> 00:03:46.046
and prevent your apps
from getting rejected.

61
00:03:46.596 --> 00:03:52.066
And in order to do that, got
a little ahead on myself,

62
00:03:52.646 --> 00:03:56.046
we're going to look at 10
common pitfalls that I see over

63
00:03:56.046 --> 00:03:56.916
and over and over again.

64
00:03:56.916 --> 00:04:00.226
And the first one
is bad app icons.

65
00:03:56.916 --> 00:04:00.226
And the first one
is bad app icons.

66
00:04:00.226 --> 00:04:04.566
So this is the first place
that most people are going

67
00:04:04.566 --> 00:04:05.636
to encounter your app.

68
00:04:06.936 --> 00:04:09.116
They're going to search for
something and your app is going

69
00:04:09.116 --> 00:04:12.346
to come up in the results
alongside dozens and dozens

70
00:04:12.346 --> 00:04:15.386
of other apps, and you have
to standout from the crowd.

71
00:04:16.296 --> 00:04:17.536
This is a search for camera,

72
00:04:17.786 --> 00:04:19.125
I just did this couple
of weeks ago.

73
00:04:19.805 --> 00:04:22.156
And I bet there're some
icons here that are standing

74
00:04:22.156 --> 00:04:25.626
out better than others, that
you noticed first immediately,

75
00:04:25.676 --> 00:04:26.936
right when we got to the slide.

76
00:04:27.656 --> 00:04:29.586
And that's not unlike
what happens

77
00:04:29.586 --> 00:04:33.206
when you did the search yourself
at home on your computer.

78
00:04:34.066 --> 00:04:35.436
Things are going to
draw your eye in,

79
00:04:35.966 --> 00:04:40.416
and you immediately begin
to make a lot of assumptions

80
00:04:40.796 --> 00:04:44.556
about the user experience of
these apps, so you'll look

81
00:04:44.556 --> 00:04:46.906
at them and start to
make these inferences

82
00:04:46.906 --> 00:04:49.826
about how enjoyable
they're going to be to use,

83
00:04:49.966 --> 00:04:51.716
how intuitive the
interface is going to be,

84
00:04:52.276 --> 00:04:54.826
how well it's going
to serve your needs.

85
00:04:55.446 --> 00:04:56.546
And I think those are kind

86
00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:59.626
of reasonable assumptions
actually to make from an icon.

87
00:04:59.626 --> 00:05:01.556
I mean, if an icon looks great

88
00:04:59.626 --> 00:05:01.556
I mean, if an icon looks great

89
00:05:01.556 --> 00:05:04.806
and it obviously was carefully
crafted, it's reasonable

90
00:05:04.806 --> 00:05:09.146
to assume that the rest of the
design of the app is also great

91
00:05:09.396 --> 00:05:10.636
and also well crafted.

92
00:05:11.166 --> 00:05:13.316
But it goes beyond that.

93
00:05:13.666 --> 00:05:14.866
People start to make all sorts

94
00:05:14.866 --> 00:05:16.576
of other assumptions
about your app.

95
00:05:18.016 --> 00:05:19.366
How good the technology is.

96
00:05:19.886 --> 00:05:21.426
How secure your data is.

97
00:05:21.906 --> 00:05:23.216
How performant it is.

98
00:05:23.506 --> 00:05:24.366
Is it stable?

99
00:05:25.346 --> 00:05:29.146
Is it going to have
functionality which is ahead--

100
00:05:29.266 --> 00:05:32.236
you know, advanced better
than the competition?

101
00:05:32.806 --> 00:05:35.356
So with that in mind,

102
00:05:35.576 --> 00:05:38.526
an app icon is really an
important thing to focus on.

103
00:05:39.986 --> 00:05:40.916
And what are the qualities

104
00:05:40.916 --> 00:05:43.536
that distinguish a
really great app icon?

105
00:05:44.076 --> 00:05:45.506
Well, there's two main things.

106
00:05:45.926 --> 00:05:50.326
One, it's beautiful and I think
probably more importantly,

107
00:05:50.326 --> 00:05:52.076
it's instantly recognizable.

108
00:05:52.666 --> 00:05:56.196
So how do you accomplish that?

109
00:05:56.656 --> 00:05:58.646
Well, there're six things
that I want to point

110
00:05:58.646 --> 00:06:00.696
out that are important
to keep in mind.

111
00:05:58.646 --> 00:06:00.696
out that are important
to keep in mind.

112
00:06:00.696 --> 00:06:04.196
I think they distinguish
every great app icon.

113
00:06:04.736 --> 00:06:09.336
The first, focus
on unique shape.

114
00:06:10.366 --> 00:06:12.746
These four icons, they
do different things,

115
00:06:12.746 --> 00:06:16.146
some are very simple
or with solid colors,

116
00:06:16.146 --> 00:06:17.326
or just a clean gradient.

117
00:06:17.666 --> 00:06:21.206
Others are a little bit more
complex but they all start

118
00:06:21.206 --> 00:06:24.106
with this very basic
shape, and that allows them

119
00:06:24.106 --> 00:06:26.776
to be recognizable
at a great distance.

120
00:06:27.666 --> 00:06:28.476
So you guys in the back

121
00:06:28.476 --> 00:06:31.216
of the room right now are
having a really easy time making

122
00:06:31.216 --> 00:06:35.386
out what the shape of these
icons is, and that's important.

123
00:06:35.996 --> 00:06:37.776
Icons are seen at
all different sizes.

124
00:06:37.776 --> 00:06:42.166
You know, it's not just the
size you see in the store,

125
00:06:42.336 --> 00:06:44.866
it gets smaller on the
home screen and smaller

126
00:06:44.866 --> 00:06:46.076
on the notification center

127
00:06:46.076 --> 00:06:47.536
and it's really small
inside the groups.

128
00:06:47.536 --> 00:06:50.196
So you have to make sure
that the imaging you choose

129
00:06:50.196 --> 00:06:52.366
for your app icon is kind
of reduce really well

130
00:06:52.786 --> 00:06:54.416
and be clear at any size.

131
00:06:56.616 --> 00:07:00.936
The next step is to just
choose a limited pallet,

132
00:06:56.616 --> 00:07:00.936
The next step is to just
choose a limited pallet,

133
00:07:02.116 --> 00:07:03.936
one color, maybe two.

134
00:07:04.846 --> 00:07:07.856
Now, there're app icons that
have much more than one color

135
00:07:07.856 --> 00:07:11.296
or two but it's really
complicated to pull off right.

136
00:07:11.956 --> 00:07:14.456
We'll see an example of it in
a few moments and I'll point it

137
00:07:14.456 --> 00:07:17.186
out when we get there,
but notice these icons,

138
00:07:18.196 --> 00:07:21.016
just really one color and
it has variations and tone

139
00:07:21.896 --> 00:07:24.766
but they stand out,
they're not fragmented.

140
00:07:25.346 --> 00:07:30.316
Now, the next one is to
avoid using photography

141
00:07:30.316 --> 00:07:31.246
in your app icon.

142
00:07:31.396 --> 00:07:32.796
I've seen it a number of times

143
00:07:33.226 --> 00:07:35.816
and it never works
out well in the end.

144
00:07:36.676 --> 00:07:39.186
So let's take for example,
you're making an app

145
00:07:40.146 --> 00:07:43.496
for wine lovers, to take notes
about the wines they like

146
00:07:44.796 --> 00:07:45.866
and share with others.

147
00:07:45.866 --> 00:07:49.076
So you might be tempted to
start with something like this,

148
00:07:49.846 --> 00:07:53.556
nice glass of red wine
and you just crop it,

149
00:07:53.866 --> 00:07:57.446
put some rounded corners on
it, throw a gradient over it.

150
00:07:57.996 --> 00:07:59.516
Does anyone think
that looks good?

151
00:08:00.096 --> 00:08:01.526
Looks terrible.

152
00:08:01.526 --> 00:08:05.716
So you-- but, you know,
if you want your icon

153
00:08:05.716 --> 00:08:09.706
to have these features, that's
fine, just illustrate it,

154
00:08:09.746 --> 00:08:13.736
take it to the next level,
hire a good app icon designer,

155
00:08:14.036 --> 00:08:15.156
who can pull this off well.

156
00:08:16.366 --> 00:08:18.696
And that's exactly what
the people at Sipp did,

157
00:08:19.736 --> 00:08:23.816
hired a really talented
designer named Eddie Lobanovskiy

158
00:08:24.946 --> 00:08:27.686
and he made this fantastic
illustration for their app icon.

159
00:08:28.186 --> 00:08:32.626
It has the same elements as that
photo, it's got the red wine,

160
00:08:32.936 --> 00:08:35.785
it's got the glass, it's
got the wood texture

161
00:08:36.066 --> 00:08:40.956
that evokes the barrel, but
the composition is really solid

162
00:08:41.086 --> 00:08:42.826
and it's also really creative.

163
00:08:44.006 --> 00:08:50.376
And these are two values that we
cherished at Apple, creativity

164
00:08:50.786 --> 00:08:53.186
and attention to
detail, and of course,

165
00:08:53.186 --> 00:08:56.976
the way that red wine swishes
around and forms the letter S,

166
00:08:57.476 --> 00:09:03.826
the mnemonic device to
connect with the app name.

167
00:08:57.476 --> 00:09:03.826
the mnemonic device to
connect with the app name.

168
00:09:04.036 --> 00:09:06.596
All right, so the next one
is avoid a lot of text.

169
00:09:07.386 --> 00:09:10.306
In fact, if you can get
away with having no text,

170
00:09:10.576 --> 00:09:12.406
that's probably the
right thing to do.

171
00:09:13.226 --> 00:09:16.926
So, let's take a made-up
example to illustrate a point.

172
00:09:17.506 --> 00:09:20.606
This is for a fictitious
hair salon and make

173
00:09:20.606 --> 00:09:21.886
up studio called Fuzz.

174
00:09:22.706 --> 00:09:25.026
Now, you can have
an icon that's--

175
00:09:25.086 --> 00:09:28.396
a logo that's this complicated
and it might work really well

176
00:09:28.396 --> 00:09:32.186
in website or in marketing
collateral, on a billboard,

177
00:09:32.186 --> 00:09:35.576
but when you reduce it
down to use as app icon,

178
00:09:36.106 --> 00:09:39.296
it starts to break down
very quickly especially

179
00:09:39.616 --> 00:09:42.936
when you start to think
about all the smaller sizes

180
00:09:43.006 --> 00:09:44.116
that people are going see then.

181
00:09:44.706 --> 00:09:47.816
So that was a fake example.

182
00:09:48.796 --> 00:09:50.296
Let's take a more real example.

183
00:09:50.526 --> 00:09:52.546
A lot of you guys use this app.

184
00:09:52.686 --> 00:09:55.106
It's a great app,
ness, you can use it

185
00:09:55.106 --> 00:09:56.976
to find restaurant
recommendations

186
00:09:56.976 --> 00:09:59.346
and they have very customized
personal profile based

187
00:09:59.346 --> 00:10:00.666
on your own preferences.

188
00:09:59.346 --> 00:10:00.666
on your own preferences.

189
00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:05.196
And they have a really fantastic
logo that's actually really

190
00:10:05.196 --> 00:10:07.536
simple, not nearly
as complicated

191
00:10:07.536 --> 00:10:08.716
as what we just looked
at before.

192
00:10:09.286 --> 00:10:13.906
And they could've maybe just
taken that and reduced it

193
00:10:13.906 --> 00:10:15.296
and used it as an app icon.

194
00:10:16.526 --> 00:10:17.986
But that wouldn't
have been good enough.

195
00:10:18.586 --> 00:10:21.596
What they chose to do
instead was to pull

196
00:10:21.596 --> 00:10:24.326
out just the heart and use that.

197
00:10:25.246 --> 00:10:26.906
It's a really simply shape.

198
00:10:26.936 --> 00:10:28.736
Now I was going to call this

199
00:10:28.736 --> 00:10:30.896
out when I was talking
multiple colors,

200
00:10:31.076 --> 00:10:33.036
and you can see there
are multiple colors here

201
00:10:33.446 --> 00:10:36.876
but the composition of the heart
really holds that altogether.

202
00:10:37.886 --> 00:10:41.116
So even at small
sizes, it works well.

203
00:10:41.926 --> 00:10:44.816
I've had this app on my
phone for a number of months

204
00:10:45.426 --> 00:10:49.706
and it always catches my
attention, it really stands out.

205
00:10:51.236 --> 00:10:52.996
In fact, you see a lot

206
00:10:52.996 --> 00:10:54.746
of companies doing
this sort of thing.

207
00:10:55.636 --> 00:10:59.226
So for example, Pocket, they
have that little pocket icon

208
00:10:59.556 --> 00:11:02.916
with the down arrow and they
use that as their app icon,

209
00:10:59.556 --> 00:11:02.916
with the down arrow and they
use that as their app icon,

210
00:11:02.916 --> 00:11:05.016
it works really well,
or Pinterest

211
00:11:05.016 --> 00:11:09.956
with their P that's kind of
like an abstract pin or the S

212
00:11:09.956 --> 00:11:13.646
for Snapguide and
the V for Vine,

213
00:11:14.316 --> 00:11:15.316
there's some patterns here.

214
00:11:16.056 --> 00:11:18.266
But the reason why
there's this pattern is

215
00:11:18.266 --> 00:11:20.136
because this works really well.

216
00:11:20.846 --> 00:11:23.546
Now, of course, they bring in
the color from their brands

217
00:11:23.866 --> 00:11:26.236
to give it some unique
personality

218
00:11:27.076 --> 00:11:32.096
and they work well
on the home screen.

219
00:11:32.206 --> 00:11:36.306
Alright, next up,
accurately portray materials.

220
00:11:36.306 --> 00:11:41.046
Now this might be a little
bit surprising given some

221
00:11:41.176 --> 00:11:43.466
of the changes that
have taken place,

222
00:11:44.536 --> 00:11:47.026
but sometimes materials
are really important

223
00:11:47.026 --> 00:11:48.036
for your app icon.

224
00:11:48.846 --> 00:11:51.926
App icon is the ability
to be expressive

225
00:11:52.556 --> 00:11:56.986
to demonstrate your unique value
and personality of your app.

226
00:11:57.616 --> 00:11:58.936
So let's look at Paper.

227
00:11:58.936 --> 00:12:01.876
I mean, the name of
the product is Paper.

228
00:11:58.936 --> 00:12:01.876
I mean, the name of
the product is Paper.

229
00:12:01.876 --> 00:12:05.426
So it would be sort of odd
if your icon didn't look

230
00:12:05.426 --> 00:12:06.786
like it was made from paper.

231
00:12:07.586 --> 00:12:11.146
Paper is this brilliant
drawing and painting tool

232
00:12:11.186 --> 00:12:14.896
which won an ADA last year and
it's got these amazing brushes

233
00:12:14.896 --> 00:12:17.776
and you can-- anything you draw
is going to look beautiful.

234
00:12:18.386 --> 00:12:21.356
And so, they demonstrate
that by these careful washes,

235
00:12:21.706 --> 00:12:25.626
the watercolor layered
on top of layer of color.

236
00:12:25.686 --> 00:12:29.166
They have the crease of
the paper which connects

237
00:12:29.246 --> 00:12:32.866
to the journals that you
see inside of application.

238
00:12:33.696 --> 00:12:34.756
It's a really nice icon.

239
00:12:35.326 --> 00:12:38.536
And this icon, from
Square Wallet,

240
00:12:39.576 --> 00:12:41.406
it's kind of that hologram
thing that you used

241
00:12:41.476 --> 00:12:42.346
to see in credit cards.

242
00:12:42.346 --> 00:12:46.886
I don't know if they still have
them but this is beautiful.

243
00:12:47.456 --> 00:12:49.736
And I know it has
a lot of colors

244
00:12:49.736 --> 00:12:53.786
but it has an overall color
of the sort of cool blue tone

245
00:12:54.666 --> 00:12:56.646
and it's got a really
distinct shape,

246
00:12:56.646 --> 00:12:58.756
it's got these concentric
squares

247
00:12:59.416 --> 00:13:02.276
so just it pops really well,
it's easy to make this out.

248
00:12:59.416 --> 00:13:02.276
so just it pops really well,
it's easy to make this out.

249
00:13:03.606 --> 00:13:05.656
If you're going to go
for a texture like this,

250
00:13:05.856 --> 00:13:08.826
this holographic paper,
you really want to sell it,

251
00:13:09.026 --> 00:13:11.076
you really want to nail it,
and this icon does that.

252
00:13:12.526 --> 00:13:14.426
Now, this icon from 1Password

253
00:13:14.426 --> 00:13:17.956
and 1Password stores
all your passwords,

254
00:13:18.296 --> 00:13:20.196
obviously that's pretty
sensitive information

255
00:13:20.506 --> 00:13:23.186
so you want to get a sense
that that data is secure,

256
00:13:23.186 --> 00:13:27.636
and this icon conveys that
by looking like a lock or--

257
00:13:27.806 --> 00:13:31.616
sorry, a safe, you
know, it feels strong,

258
00:13:31.616 --> 00:13:32.746
it feels impenetrable.

259
00:13:33.136 --> 00:13:36.686
So, it's communicating
these emotional reactions

260
00:13:37.516 --> 00:13:40.286
or it's eliciting these
emotional reactions in us

261
00:13:40.596 --> 00:13:43.626
and we see it and that's why
they use these materials.

262
00:13:44.106 --> 00:13:46.966
But, again, it's
really realistic.

263
00:13:47.466 --> 00:13:52.256
And finally, I came across
this icon when I was looking

264
00:13:52.306 --> 00:13:53.946
for some examples
to show you guys,

265
00:13:54.426 --> 00:13:57.186
and this is for an
app called LifeKraze,

266
00:13:57.746 --> 00:13:58.946
it's kind of a cool app.

267
00:13:59.196 --> 00:14:02.986
You set some personal goals and
then you have a team of people

268
00:13:59.196 --> 00:14:02.986
You set some personal goals and
then you have a team of people

269
00:14:03.396 --> 00:14:05.806
who are in your social
network and they cheer you on

270
00:14:05.996 --> 00:14:07.346
and in turn, you cheer them on.

271
00:14:07.976 --> 00:14:09.906
And I didn't a get a chance
to confirm this with them

272
00:14:09.906 --> 00:14:12.586
but my interpretation of this
is that it's meant to be kind

273
00:14:12.586 --> 00:14:13.656
of like a team Jersey

274
00:14:14.016 --> 00:14:16.746
or sponsorship kind
of thing, embroidery.

275
00:14:18.016 --> 00:14:21.116
But look how amazing
this icon is.

276
00:14:22.486 --> 00:14:26.236
I mean, the texture of the
string, the embroidery,

277
00:14:27.736 --> 00:14:30.166
I'm not even sure
how they made this.

278
00:14:31.406 --> 00:14:33.276
[laughter] I've been at
this for a really long time.

279
00:14:34.296 --> 00:14:36.976
I want to go out there and
figure out their trick.

280
00:14:37.586 --> 00:14:39.576
So this is brilliant.

281
00:14:40.396 --> 00:14:43.246
Again, this is highest
level of artistry.

282
00:14:43.756 --> 00:14:47.866
And finally, be creative.

283
00:14:47.916 --> 00:14:49.326
I can't emphasize this enough.

284
00:14:49.736 --> 00:14:52.156
You try to stand out from
the crowd, you're trying

285
00:14:52.156 --> 00:14:53.336
to stand out from the rest.

286
00:14:54.126 --> 00:14:56.756
So take for example this icon
for an app called Routesy,

287
00:14:56.756 --> 00:14:57.996
it gives you information

288
00:14:57.996 --> 00:15:02.226
about local Muni Transit
timetables and such.

289
00:14:57.996 --> 00:15:02.226
about local Muni Transit
timetables and such.

290
00:15:02.766 --> 00:15:05.146
This looks like the
old Muni Passes.

291
00:15:05.986 --> 00:15:09.576
It's really nice,
it looks pretty.

292
00:15:09.736 --> 00:15:11.006
This icon from Hipstamatic.

293
00:15:12.576 --> 00:15:15.516
You guys are familiar with this?

294
00:15:15.726 --> 00:15:16.836
Or Evernote Food?

295
00:15:18.176 --> 00:15:21.456
Or this icon for Brewski Me.

296
00:15:22.446 --> 00:15:25.596
I mean, look at the
perspiration on the glass,

297
00:15:26.306 --> 00:15:29.096
in a way that frothy
head foam is

298
00:15:29.096 --> 00:15:30.806
about to just fall
over the edge.

299
00:15:31.226 --> 00:15:32.106
It's really dynamic.

300
00:15:32.226 --> 00:15:34.666
It has a lot of good
characteristics

301
00:15:35.196 --> 00:15:36.756
that we look for
in illustration.

302
00:15:38.116 --> 00:15:41.136
And yet, while this is a
really complicated rendering,

303
00:15:41.916 --> 00:15:44.596
it's actually kind of simple
and when you pull back from it,

304
00:15:44.816 --> 00:15:48.246
you see it's just a big area
of yellow color in the center

305
00:15:48.246 --> 00:15:51.046
with a nice white outline,
stands out really well

306
00:15:51.046 --> 00:15:52.236
from multiple backgrounds.

307
00:15:53.836 --> 00:15:54.806
Anyone thirsty?

308
00:15:55.016 --> 00:15:56.536
I became a little thirsty.

309
00:15:57.166 --> 00:16:00.536
So these are really
creative icons.

310
00:15:57.166 --> 00:16:00.536
So these are really
creative icons.

311
00:16:01.816 --> 00:16:05.066
Now, we'd looked at a range
of icons and I'm going

312
00:16:05.936 --> 00:16:08.646
to show you all the way
for a new phone icon.

313
00:16:08.646 --> 00:16:10.706
It couldn't be more simple.

314
00:16:11.176 --> 00:16:14.616
Just a simple shape and a
gradient up to something

315
00:16:14.616 --> 00:16:19.856
which is a little bit more
complicated all the way

316
00:16:19.856 --> 00:16:22.436
to something which is this
really detailed illustration

317
00:16:22.436 --> 00:16:22.886
for Sip.

318
00:16:22.886 --> 00:16:26.986
And these are all valid
approaches to designing icons.

319
00:16:28.156 --> 00:16:30.956
They work well for their
respective products.

320
00:16:30.956 --> 00:16:36.176
Alright, next bit of
advice, please make sure

321
00:16:36.176 --> 00:16:39.016
to check your icon against
multiple backgrounds.

322
00:16:39.646 --> 00:16:43.526
It's really tempting, a lot
easier, in fact, to just test it

323
00:16:43.526 --> 00:16:44.886
against a black background.

324
00:16:45.266 --> 00:16:48.286
But a lot of times, you can't--
you have to account for the fact

325
00:16:48.286 --> 00:16:51.066
that these icons are going to
show up against who knows what.

326
00:16:52.086 --> 00:16:56.556
And also, put your icons into
a group and then collapse

327
00:16:56.556 --> 00:16:59.406
that group and evaluate
how well it's working.

328
00:16:59.986 --> 00:17:06.086
So, I'm going to show you
really a cool case study.

329
00:16:59.986 --> 00:17:06.086
So, I'm going to show you
really a cool case study.

330
00:17:06.766 --> 00:17:09.266
This is for an app
called Turnplay

331
00:17:10.566 --> 00:17:13.356
and the design work was done
by a company called Ramotion

332
00:17:13.566 --> 00:17:17.576
and what Turnplay is, is this
fun little app that allows you

333
00:17:17.576 --> 00:17:20.445
to play your MP3 files,
whatever your music files

334
00:17:20.826 --> 00:17:21.925
as though they were vinyl,

335
00:17:23.316 --> 00:17:26.195
and that's the whole
sum of this app.

336
00:17:26.266 --> 00:17:28.296
That's what it does and
that what makes it unique

337
00:17:28.296 --> 00:17:29.096
and special.

338
00:17:30.976 --> 00:17:32.876
So even when you
select your songs,

339
00:17:32.926 --> 00:17:34.616
they have the sleeves
for the vinyl.

340
00:17:35.556 --> 00:17:37.696
And then this is the turntable
interface that you see

341
00:17:37.696 --> 00:17:38.696
when you're playing a record.

342
00:17:38.696 --> 00:17:40.716
This is not a photo.

343
00:17:41.496 --> 00:17:44.346
Every pixel here was hand-drawn

344
00:17:45.146 --> 00:17:47.006
in Illustrator then
in Photoshop.

345
00:17:47.006 --> 00:17:50.626
I mean, this is an exquisite
rendering of a turntable.

346
00:17:51.246 --> 00:17:55.626
So when it came time for
them to make an app icon,

347
00:17:55.626 --> 00:17:57.786
they knew they needed to connect
to those characteristics.

348
00:17:58.166 --> 00:18:01.306
They knew they needed to
demonstrate the beauty

349
00:17:58.166 --> 00:18:01.306
They knew they needed to
demonstrate the beauty

350
00:18:01.306 --> 00:18:03.426
of that turntable
interface but they also had

351
00:18:03.426 --> 00:18:05.136
to get the symbolism
of the icon right,

352
00:18:06.396 --> 00:18:09.176
and so Ramotion started
with sketches.

353
00:18:09.176 --> 00:18:11.756
Now, there's a lot of different
approaches to making icons.

354
00:18:12.986 --> 00:18:15.246
You could start in a 3D
rendering tool, you can start

355
00:18:15.246 --> 00:18:17.476
in Photoshop, you can
do whiteboard drawings.

356
00:18:17.866 --> 00:18:20.526
In fact, that's-- my team
used to do a lot of it

357
00:18:20.526 --> 00:18:23.566
when we started app
icons for Apple products.

358
00:18:24.296 --> 00:18:27.276
But they started with paper
sketches and the team set

359
00:18:27.276 --> 00:18:29.006
out to work out all
these different ideas.

360
00:18:29.846 --> 00:18:30.526
And as you could see,

361
00:18:30.526 --> 00:18:32.226
they explored a lot
of different things.

362
00:18:32.576 --> 00:18:36.916
All these of icons have a
vinyl record at the heart of it

363
00:18:37.346 --> 00:18:39.336
but then they tried
different compositions,

364
00:18:39.716 --> 00:18:43.356
adding different elements,
you can see the hands here,

365
00:18:44.176 --> 00:18:47.456
the styluses, different
orientations,

366
00:18:47.456 --> 00:18:50.496
a lot of them are top-down but
this one second from the right,

367
00:18:50.496 --> 00:18:52.416
is at a 45-degree angle,

368
00:18:52.596 --> 00:18:54.846
and sometimes the record is
floating above the platter.

369
00:18:55.306 --> 00:18:57.956
Sometimes, there's a-- the hint
of an audience in the background

370
00:18:58.356 --> 00:19:00.076
or the dot pattern
from the platter

371
00:18:58.356 --> 00:19:00.076
or the dot pattern
from the platter

372
00:19:00.076 --> 00:19:02.466
to tell you what tempo you're
playing your record at.

373
00:19:03.526 --> 00:19:05.106
It's really antiquated
technology.

374
00:19:05.106 --> 00:19:09.356
How many people have
heard of a turntable?

375
00:19:09.356 --> 00:19:12.266
So, they tried all
these different things.

376
00:19:12.816 --> 00:19:15.016
They even tried to do what
we were looking at before,

377
00:19:15.016 --> 00:19:18.236
which is to take the first
letter of their app name, the T,

378
00:19:18.236 --> 00:19:21.176
and integrate that into
the design, and they came

379
00:19:21.176 --> 00:19:25.086
up with some pretty interesting
ideas on how to accomplish that.

380
00:19:26.156 --> 00:19:29.186
By starting with sketches,
you're not thinking about color,

381
00:19:29.226 --> 00:19:31.826
you're not thinking about
materials, you're thinking

382
00:19:31.826 --> 00:19:34.536
about the core element
of the illustration

383
00:19:34.816 --> 00:19:36.146
which is the composition.

384
00:19:36.416 --> 00:19:39.456
It's really important that
your composition is solid.

385
00:19:40.786 --> 00:19:43.456
So they kept going, tried out--

386
00:19:43.456 --> 00:19:45.896
I don't know what the
fingerprints thing is.

387
00:19:45.896 --> 00:19:47.306
I know you get fingerprints
on vinyl.

388
00:19:47.916 --> 00:19:52.046
I'm glad they didn't
go down that route.

389
00:19:52.116 --> 00:19:54.356
And finally, they started to
kind of lock in what they wanted

390
00:19:54.356 --> 00:20:01.256
to do and eventually,
they got to this.

391
00:19:54.356 --> 00:20:01.256
to do and eventually,
they got to this.

392
00:20:01.476 --> 00:20:03.316
Really simple, right?

393
00:20:05.756 --> 00:20:10.826
Turntable, play, and you can
see they started to think, "Oh,

394
00:20:10.826 --> 00:20:13.556
we're going to have this play
icon in here" but it's going

395
00:20:13.556 --> 00:20:16.586
to be like this little sticky
label that goes on the record.

396
00:20:17.126 --> 00:20:20.126
But these are concentric shapes.

397
00:20:20.376 --> 00:20:21.356
They're really powerful.

398
00:20:21.836 --> 00:20:25.036
This is a strong form
in and of itself.

399
00:20:25.436 --> 00:20:31.146
Only from-- only when they
had that did they to start add

400
00:20:31.146 --> 00:20:32.266
in some of the detail.

401
00:20:32.566 --> 00:20:34.186
They started to add
in gradients.

402
00:20:34.736 --> 00:20:36.736
They added in the dot
pattern around the platter

403
00:20:36.736 --> 00:20:38.786
but they didn't make
it totally accurate

404
00:20:38.786 --> 00:20:39.616
because that would
have been a mess.

405
00:20:39.826 --> 00:20:41.646
I mean, it just would have
been too much detail to work

406
00:20:41.646 --> 00:20:44.306
at any size, even 1024 square.

407
00:20:44.846 --> 00:20:49.746
They kept adding in a
detail, adding in detail.

408
00:20:50.896 --> 00:20:55.066
They gave that play icon that
papery texture so really knew

409
00:20:55.066 --> 00:20:56.206
that it was supposed
to be paper.

410
00:20:57.696 --> 00:20:59.026
Shading, highlight.

411
00:20:59.956 --> 00:21:02.766
With each successive
version, it really started

412
00:20:59.956 --> 00:21:02.766
With each successive
version, it really started

413
00:21:02.766 --> 00:21:04.196
to come together more and more.

414
00:21:04.596 --> 00:21:07.676
But never losing sight
of that basic shape

415
00:21:09.016 --> 00:21:16.786
that they had started with,
and it works well at all sizes

416
00:21:17.876 --> 00:21:21.486
because they stuck to that,
they stuck to that basic shape.

417
00:21:21.926 --> 00:21:25.936
Alright, so that was a
lot of stuff on icons

418
00:21:26.286 --> 00:21:28.976
but it's probably the most
important thing to get right

419
00:21:28.976 --> 00:21:30.326
when it comes to visual design.

420
00:21:30.906 --> 00:21:32.906
Let's move on.

421
00:21:33.226 --> 00:21:38.116
This is Forced Registration,
and for the example,

422
00:21:38.526 --> 00:21:40.126
this actually was
shown last year.

423
00:21:40.516 --> 00:21:44.776
But a lot of apps do
this kind of thing

424
00:21:44.856 --> 00:21:46.356
where they give you two options.

425
00:21:46.356 --> 00:21:49.486
You open the app and they
ask you to sign up or sign in

426
00:21:49.486 --> 00:21:53.816
and a lot of people hit the Home
button and delete the app icon.

427
00:21:54.236 --> 00:21:59.356
People hate this which is
why it's mind-boggling to me

428
00:21:59.566 --> 00:22:01.486
that it still happens,
but it still does.

429
00:21:59.566 --> 00:22:01.486
that it still happens,
but it still does.

430
00:22:02.316 --> 00:22:03.576
So let's look at a case study.

431
00:22:04.106 --> 00:22:06.826
This was an app called Fondu.

432
00:22:07.066 --> 00:22:09.176
They used to be in App
Store, they're not anymore,

433
00:22:09.356 --> 00:22:12.416
they've been acquired by Airbnb.

434
00:22:12.926 --> 00:22:13.906
So all the stuff
I'm going to show

435
00:22:13.906 --> 00:22:16.316
that they did obviously was
very successful for them,

436
00:22:16.766 --> 00:22:19.056
but they used to
make you sign up.

437
00:22:19.056 --> 00:22:22.076
It's a social networking
food app.

438
00:22:23.596 --> 00:22:27.356
And they realized that
weren't getting the uptake

439
00:22:27.686 --> 00:22:29.416
in people signing
up and registering

440
00:22:30.646 --> 00:22:32.286
because they would
just do what I said,

441
00:22:32.286 --> 00:22:33.936
they would leave right away.

442
00:22:34.136 --> 00:22:35.446
They didn't know the
value of the app.

443
00:22:36.156 --> 00:22:39.476
So instead, they completely went
away and redesigned their app

444
00:22:40.096 --> 00:22:42.136
to show a few screens
right off the bat,

445
00:22:42.496 --> 00:22:45.306
where you can see
something about the features

446
00:22:45.306 --> 00:22:47.686
and understand what
purpose this product serves,

447
00:22:48.526 --> 00:22:53.146
and only when you got to the end
of it where you given the choice

448
00:22:53.216 --> 00:22:54.906
to sign up or to sign in.

449
00:22:55.816 --> 00:23:01.026
But even with that, they
allowed a third choice which was

450
00:22:55.816 --> 00:23:01.026
But even with that, they
allowed a third choice which was

451
00:23:01.066 --> 00:23:03.636
to continue forward
and get a taste--

452
00:23:03.636 --> 00:23:05.626
this is a nice little
bit of copy--

453
00:23:06.516 --> 00:23:09.806
and you can use public
features of the app,

454
00:23:10.506 --> 00:23:12.136
and so you really
would get a sense

455
00:23:12.136 --> 00:23:15.596
for why this app had value,
what was interesting about it.

456
00:23:16.316 --> 00:23:19.556
And I recommend that if
you're in a similar situation,

457
00:23:19.556 --> 00:23:20.686
you should do the same thing.

458
00:23:21.526 --> 00:23:23.786
You want to allow people
to try before they buy.

459
00:23:27.996 --> 00:23:30.786
As a result, they had
a 42 percent increase

460
00:23:30.786 --> 00:23:33.996
in registration shortly after
they made these design changes.

461
00:23:34.506 --> 00:23:36.246
As we talked about, they
eventually got acquired,

462
00:23:36.536 --> 00:23:38.916
so do what they did
and allow people

463
00:23:38.916 --> 00:23:40.796
to use your product
rather than forcing them

464
00:23:40.796 --> 00:23:41.976
to registrater right
off the bat.

465
00:23:42.436 --> 00:23:46.146
All right, so that was
forced registration.

466
00:23:47.566 --> 00:23:49.886
The next pitfall
is Tiny Controls.

467
00:23:50.986 --> 00:23:54.096
Now, this is how we could
have designed the WWDC app.

468
00:23:54.096 --> 00:23:56.916
We could have made text smaller,

469
00:23:56.916 --> 00:23:59.746
we could have made the rows
smaller, little date switcher

470
00:23:59.746 --> 00:24:03.956
at the top, all the buttons
and the nav bar, but instead,

471
00:23:59.746 --> 00:24:03.956
at the top, all the buttons
and the nav bar, but instead,

472
00:24:03.956 --> 00:24:05.206
this is what we actually
shipped.

473
00:24:06.606 --> 00:24:08.716
Things are-- have
normal metrics,

474
00:24:08.716 --> 00:24:10.166
they're a lot easier to tap.

475
00:24:10.926 --> 00:24:15.686
If you have greater density
and really small tap targets,

476
00:24:16.096 --> 00:24:18.296
it's hard to aim
so that slows you

477
00:24:18.296 --> 00:24:20.996
down as you're pointing your
finger towards the screen,

478
00:24:20.996 --> 00:24:22.776
it makes you more conscious
of what you're doing.

479
00:24:23.146 --> 00:24:25.976
So while you might see more
stuff on screen at one time,

480
00:24:26.336 --> 00:24:27.916
your app becomes harder to use.

481
00:24:27.916 --> 00:24:32.326
It's much easier when you have
really easy to tap targets.

482
00:24:32.326 --> 00:24:36.776
You have to design your
products for a fingertip.

483
00:24:37.736 --> 00:24:39.586
I'm surprised when
I see some apps

484
00:24:39.646 --> 00:24:42.406
that have these really
small tap targets and things

485
00:24:42.406 --> 00:24:43.406
that are crammed together.

486
00:24:43.406 --> 00:24:49.236
It looks like it was designed
for someone who has a cursor.

487
00:24:49.426 --> 00:24:53.016
So as you'll see, if you might
read on the HIG, we recommend

488
00:24:53.046 --> 00:24:57.966
that controls are 44 points
tall, and you'll see that over

489
00:24:57.966 --> 00:25:00.726
and over again in the
controls that we have.

490
00:24:57.966 --> 00:25:00.726
and over again in the
controls that we have.

491
00:25:01.726 --> 00:25:07.726
Now, this number, 44 points,
this goes back, this isn't new

492
00:25:07.726 --> 00:25:10.706
to iOS 7 even though I'm showing
an iOS 7 screen right here.

493
00:25:11.216 --> 00:25:14.466
The metrics for a lot of our
controls have stayed the same

494
00:25:15.256 --> 00:25:18.836
because the size of our
fingers have stayed the same.

495
00:25:19.996 --> 00:25:21.786
So you'll see it
over and over again.

496
00:25:22.116 --> 00:25:25.896
Nav bar 44 points,
toolbar 44 points.

497
00:25:26.226 --> 00:25:30.656
Even the little callout
for the map is 44 points.

498
00:25:33.556 --> 00:25:38.266
Now, if you have additional
space like we did for calendar

499
00:25:38.266 --> 00:25:41.056
in iOS 6, make your
controls bigger,

500
00:25:41.716 --> 00:25:44.866
it just makes them
easier to tap.

501
00:25:45.046 --> 00:25:46.846
And we've updated calculator

502
00:25:47.666 --> 00:25:49.996
and now these controls
are bigger still,

503
00:25:51.266 --> 00:25:55.366
so they're even easier to tap.

504
00:25:55.556 --> 00:25:58.516
And some apps you use
when you're moving around.

505
00:25:58.886 --> 00:26:02.676
This is a Cycling app by Strava,
it allows you track your ride

506
00:25:58.886 --> 00:26:02.676
This is a Cycling app by Strava,
it allows you track your ride

507
00:26:02.676 --> 00:26:06.476
through GPS, and you
want to be able to start

508
00:26:06.476 --> 00:26:09.346
and stop this while
you're on your bike

509
00:26:09.576 --> 00:26:10.606
and while you're moving.

510
00:26:11.166 --> 00:26:12.986
So this button that
they have for doing

511
00:26:12.986 --> 00:26:15.496
that is 120 points in diameter.

512
00:26:15.586 --> 00:26:16.706
It's really easy to tap.

513
00:26:16.706 --> 00:26:19.856
I wouldn't be surprised actually
if the tap area is bigger

514
00:26:19.856 --> 00:26:22.856
than the size of the button.

515
00:26:22.996 --> 00:26:25.536
And lastly, when you're
evaluating whether

516
00:26:25.536 --> 00:26:30.906
or not a control is large
enough, test it on your device.

517
00:26:32.416 --> 00:26:34.076
There's no substitute for that,

518
00:26:34.346 --> 00:26:36.886
you can't make this decision
just sitting at your desk

519
00:26:37.546 --> 00:26:39.036
and tapping the interface
of the phone.

520
00:26:39.626 --> 00:26:42.806
Go outside, walk around,
use it as an opportunity

521
00:26:43.056 --> 00:26:46.676
to do something healthy, stretch
your legs, get some fresh air,

522
00:26:46.676 --> 00:26:51.346
give your eyes a break, maybe
hold a cup of coffee in one hand

523
00:26:51.346 --> 00:26:54.336
and try to use your phone, and
see how that works for you.

524
00:26:55.076 --> 00:26:56.456
Think it'll be educational.

525
00:26:56.456 --> 00:27:02.626
All right, the next common
pitfall is Hard-to-Read Text.

526
00:26:56.456 --> 00:27:02.626
All right, the next common
pitfall is Hard-to-Read Text.

527
00:27:03.666 --> 00:27:06.996
Now, this is how our WWDC
app could have looked

528
00:27:07.836 --> 00:27:09.976
if we were cruel and insane.

529
00:27:12.106 --> 00:27:15.686
[laughter] But why is
text hard to read here?

530
00:27:15.686 --> 00:27:19.016
Well, it's hard to read because
the colors are too saturated,

531
00:27:19.016 --> 00:27:19.846
they're too bright.

532
00:27:20.506 --> 00:27:27.996
The font that I chose, it's not
bad per se, but it doesn't work

533
00:27:27.996 --> 00:27:30.026
at a small size,
that script font,

534
00:27:30.506 --> 00:27:32.776
it's way too small,
can't make that out.

535
00:27:33.246 --> 00:27:37.406
This would have really
stoked the rumor mills

536
00:27:37.406 --> 00:27:39.316
about the new design of iOS 7.

537
00:27:40.686 --> 00:27:42.846
[laughter] We probably
should have done it.

538
00:27:43.896 --> 00:27:46.456
So this is something a little
bit more plausible, right?

539
00:27:46.456 --> 00:27:49.056
I see some stuff more like
this on a common basis

540
00:27:50.146 --> 00:27:52.396
and the problem is
just low contrast.

541
00:27:53.016 --> 00:27:55.876
A good metric to use is that
the contrast between text

542
00:27:55.876 --> 00:27:58.516
and background should
be at least 50 percent,

543
00:27:59.426 --> 00:28:03.556
maybe 60 percent in brightness
which is kind of a hard thing

544
00:27:59.426 --> 00:28:03.556
maybe 60 percent in brightness
which is kind of a hard thing

545
00:28:03.556 --> 00:28:06.116
when you're talking about
different colors like red

546
00:28:06.116 --> 00:28:08.576
against yellow or something
like that but if you were

547
00:28:08.776 --> 00:28:12.296
to desaturate your image and
then measure the colors of gray,

548
00:28:12.596 --> 00:28:15.966
that's the kind of delta you
want between the color values.

549
00:28:16.506 --> 00:28:20.126
So this is the actual
design for the WWDC app

550
00:28:20.936 --> 00:28:23.736
and you can see here the
text is basically black

551
00:28:24.086 --> 00:28:26.726
and the background is
almost totally white.

552
00:28:27.316 --> 00:28:29.776
So it's really easy to
read and, of course,

553
00:28:29.806 --> 00:28:32.236
the fonts are a nice,
legible size.

554
00:28:35.096 --> 00:28:39.546
On Wednesday, I talked about
this screen in the context

555
00:28:40.306 --> 00:28:45.356
of type and I want to bring it
up again because for one thing,

556
00:28:46.126 --> 00:28:49.456
while there's a lot of different
sizes of type and weights

557
00:28:49.456 --> 00:28:52.936
of type, which is really
important for establishing,

558
00:28:52.996 --> 00:28:54.946
communicating information
hierarchy,

559
00:28:55.346 --> 00:28:57.536
calling out which things are
more important than others,

560
00:28:58.716 --> 00:29:00.666
it's all the same typeface.

561
00:28:58.716 --> 00:29:00.666
it's all the same typeface.

562
00:29:01.556 --> 00:29:06.226
And that adds to a sense of
coherency, it all fits together.

563
00:29:06.226 --> 00:29:08.296
We didn't just throw
a script font in here.

564
00:29:08.936 --> 00:29:10.966
Now, I really recommend
that you do the same thing.

565
00:29:11.486 --> 00:29:13.066
You can mix and match typefaces,

566
00:29:13.436 --> 00:29:15.606
that's actually an extremely
difficult thing to do.

567
00:29:16.126 --> 00:29:18.556
I don't do it 'cause
I don't think--

568
00:29:18.556 --> 00:29:21.296
I usually don't think
it's very successful.

569
00:29:21.296 --> 00:29:22.596
I don't know how to
pull it off very well.

570
00:29:23.166 --> 00:29:28.496
So we have all these different
styles of type and again,

571
00:29:28.496 --> 00:29:31.896
another plug for dynamic
type 'cause that's how all

572
00:29:31.896 --> 00:29:32.696
of this was made.

573
00:29:33.246 --> 00:29:34.426
This is really good way to go.

574
00:29:35.106 --> 00:29:37.496
If you use this, you're
going to have great results.

575
00:29:37.826 --> 00:29:42.126
Now, the other thing
is we have large blocks

576
00:29:42.126 --> 00:29:44.946
of text they have mailed
from both the 6 and 7 here.

577
00:29:45.626 --> 00:29:48.396
And previously, we would
recommend as a baseline

578
00:29:48.706 --> 00:29:52.186
that your fonts are 15 points or
higher if you have large blocks

579
00:29:52.186 --> 00:29:56.496
of text that people are going
to need to read for a while.

580
00:29:56.696 --> 00:29:57.906
Now, that's changed a bit.

581
00:29:59.256 --> 00:30:01.166
We can't just say
make it 15 points.

582
00:29:59.256 --> 00:30:01.166
We can't just say
make it 15 points.

583
00:30:01.166 --> 00:30:03.026
Now, with dynamic type,
it's all scalable.

584
00:30:03.626 --> 00:30:06.306
So these really mean,
what size of body text?

585
00:30:06.726 --> 00:30:09.106
But this is the default
size which is large

586
00:30:09.376 --> 00:30:11.946
and as you can see,
the font size is larger

587
00:30:11.946 --> 00:30:14.806
than what we have before,
and that's something

588
00:30:14.946 --> 00:30:16.486
that we talked a lot
about on Wednesday

589
00:30:16.586 --> 00:30:18.626
which is the importance
of legibility

590
00:30:18.626 --> 00:30:21.926
and I think even what we were
doing before, our minimum size

591
00:30:21.986 --> 00:30:24.026
for fonts, for body
fonts, was too small

592
00:30:24.546 --> 00:30:27.256
and the decision was made
to up it just because it's

593
00:30:27.256 --> 00:30:28.866
so much easier to read.

594
00:30:29.626 --> 00:30:32.156
Now, another important
thing about text is

595
00:30:32.156 --> 00:30:33.976
that you want to have alignment.

596
00:30:34.646 --> 00:30:36.256
Alignment provides structure.

597
00:30:37.076 --> 00:30:41.926
It's the key to making an app
UI feel aesthetically balanced

598
00:30:41.926 --> 00:30:44.426
and organized, easy to look at.

599
00:30:45.566 --> 00:30:48.156
But beyond that, it makes
it easy to scan text

600
00:30:48.156 --> 00:30:49.506
and find what you're
looking for.

601
00:30:50.056 --> 00:30:54.066
This UI is static now but a lot
of times, when you're looking

602
00:30:54.066 --> 00:30:56.676
at this, you're swiping it
quickly and you're scanning

603
00:30:56.676 --> 00:30:58.746
for text, you're trying
to make out, you know,

604
00:30:58.746 --> 00:31:04.266
I'm looking for text from Paul
Brennen or Michelle Humphrey

605
00:30:58.746 --> 00:31:04.266
I'm looking for text from Paul
Brennen or Michelle Humphrey

606
00:31:04.386 --> 00:31:07.156
and you have to be able to
see that even as it's moving.

607
00:31:07.426 --> 00:31:08.686
Alignment is the key to that.

608
00:31:10.116 --> 00:31:12.416
And another important
about text, again,

609
00:31:12.416 --> 00:31:14.486
you'll see a left
alignment, it's very clear,

610
00:31:14.486 --> 00:31:19.516
just like before, is
breaking up your content.

611
00:31:20.436 --> 00:31:22.636
Don't just slam stuff
together because you want

612
00:31:22.636 --> 00:31:25.276
to cram more stuff on the
screen, onto the screen.

613
00:31:25.556 --> 00:31:27.856
You need to break up the
text the people are seeing.

614
00:31:29.186 --> 00:31:33.546
It helps you to see connections
between disparate lines of text.

615
00:31:33.896 --> 00:31:35.836
So these phone numbers
are grouped together,

616
00:31:35.836 --> 00:31:38.456
so I understand that whole
areas about phone numbers

617
00:31:38.776 --> 00:31:42.006
which is separate from FaceTime,
separate from sending a message

618
00:31:42.006 --> 00:31:44.026
or looking up someone's
address on the map.

619
00:31:44.636 --> 00:31:46.296
Negative space is
the key to that.

620
00:31:47.706 --> 00:31:51.106
Use it well, use it liberally
and if it's not enough,

621
00:31:51.106 --> 00:31:57.166
use separator lines to even-to
draw even clearer separations

622
00:31:57.216 --> 00:32:00.286
between different
lines of texts.

623
00:31:57.216 --> 00:32:00.286
between different
lines of texts.

624
00:32:00.406 --> 00:32:04.166
And again, test on a device.

625
00:32:04.816 --> 00:32:07.086
The reason why I'm
bringing it up now is

626
00:32:07.086 --> 00:32:10.076
because when I'm talking
about contrast, when you look

627
00:32:10.076 --> 00:32:12.766
at something indoors, it's
really easy to see all

628
00:32:12.766 --> 00:32:14.706
of the nuances of the
different shades of color.

629
00:32:15.176 --> 00:32:17.966
When you walk outside,
things are very different,

630
00:32:18.856 --> 00:32:22.046
colors just compress into each
other, becomes hard to tell

631
00:32:22.046 --> 00:32:22.866
that there's differences.

632
00:32:22.866 --> 00:32:25.576
So you really want to make
sure that you're evaluating

633
00:32:25.576 --> 00:32:28.666
if you have sufficient contrast
by walking outside and not

634
00:32:28.666 --> 00:32:31.566
at night but at 2:00
in the afternoon,

635
00:32:31.756 --> 00:32:34.266
when it's really
bright and sunny.

636
00:32:34.436 --> 00:32:39.466
And also, there's a lot of great
tools available for helping

637
00:32:39.516 --> 00:32:42.266
to look at UI and
analyze things.

638
00:32:42.706 --> 00:32:45.326
LiveView is one of the
oldest, it allows you

639
00:32:45.386 --> 00:32:48.666
to just take a design
and send it to a device.

640
00:32:49.646 --> 00:32:51.196
Skala View is a great tool.

641
00:32:51.316 --> 00:32:54.976
xScope Mirror has a lot
of pixel levels instrument

642
00:32:54.976 --> 00:32:56.286
measuring stuff.

643
00:32:57.306 --> 00:32:59.046
Screenshots Journal
also awesome.

644
00:33:01.396 --> 00:33:03.916
All right, next Ambiguous
Alerts.

645
00:33:06.596 --> 00:33:10.536
So we've all seen things
like this, maybe we had it

646
00:33:10.536 --> 00:33:13.816
in an earlier version of our
app just for kind of debugging

647
00:33:13.816 --> 00:33:16.206
and testing and sometimes
this app makes it

648
00:33:16.206 --> 00:33:20.216
through to the final app and
this isn't helpful at all.

649
00:33:20.296 --> 00:33:21.956
You have no idea
what's going on.

650
00:33:22.866 --> 00:33:23.856
This isn't a real one.

651
00:33:24.226 --> 00:33:29.526
I've changed the names
to protect the innocent.

652
00:33:30.616 --> 00:33:33.056
This is a classic, again,

653
00:33:33.736 --> 00:33:37.366
this is real alert
that's-- has existed.

654
00:33:37.446 --> 00:33:39.386
What are you suppose to do here?

655
00:33:41.796 --> 00:33:46.556
[laughter] Catch-22.

656
00:33:47.186 --> 00:33:49.736
So be conscious of that.

657
00:33:50.056 --> 00:33:53.616
This also, obviously it's
funny because, you know, well,

658
00:33:53.616 --> 00:33:54.526
you guys all got the joke,

659
00:33:55.026 --> 00:33:57.316
but this also demonstrates
something really important

660
00:33:57.316 --> 00:33:59.246
which is that OK,
it's on the left

661
00:33:59.396 --> 00:34:00.876
and you never want to do that.

662
00:33:59.396 --> 00:34:00.876
and you never want to do that.

663
00:34:00.876 --> 00:34:02.106
You always want the affirmative,

664
00:34:02.396 --> 00:34:05.066
the forward moving
action to be on the right.

665
00:34:07.456 --> 00:34:10.666
Now, the best alert is no alert.

666
00:34:11.735 --> 00:34:15.585
Alerts are really meant to call
your attention to something,

667
00:34:15.735 --> 00:34:17.346
you know, something that
needs your attention

668
00:34:17.346 --> 00:34:18.906
and it makes you aware
of that by popping

669
00:34:18.906 --> 00:34:20.255
up this whole thing
in front of you.

670
00:34:21.045 --> 00:34:22.556
But oftentimes, that's
unnecessary.

671
00:34:22.596 --> 00:34:26.545
So if we showed an alert
every time mail was able

672
00:34:26.545 --> 00:34:28.476
to successfully update
its contents,

673
00:34:28.476 --> 00:34:31.045
that will get pretty
annoying pretty quick.

674
00:34:31.976 --> 00:34:34.056
So we just have some
status text that tells you

675
00:34:34.056 --> 00:34:35.226
when it was last updated.

676
00:34:35.795 --> 00:34:37.846
Try to do that.

677
00:34:37.846 --> 00:34:42.286
Try to integrate information
that's updating and changing

678
00:34:42.286 --> 00:34:46.686
into your app UI if you can.

679
00:34:46.906 --> 00:34:48.295
This is from iOS 6.

680
00:34:48.985 --> 00:34:50.146
This is a really valid point.

681
00:34:50.576 --> 00:34:54.146
When you bring up an
alert, label your buttons

682
00:34:54.146 --> 00:34:58.016
with the action that
they're going to perform.

683
00:34:58.116 --> 00:35:00.706
People are using your
device-- people are--

684
00:34:58.116 --> 00:35:00.706
People are using your
device-- people are--

685
00:35:00.916 --> 00:35:04.236
we're all using these
devices and we're distracted

686
00:35:04.236 --> 00:35:06.376
and we get a phone call, we
might not be paying a whole lot

687
00:35:06.376 --> 00:35:08.216
of attention, we might
of skim the question

688
00:35:08.216 --> 00:35:10.646
or the message that's
in the alert but we have

689
00:35:10.676 --> 00:35:13.276
to press the button and that
usually focuses our attention a

690
00:35:13.276 --> 00:35:14.016
little bit more.

691
00:35:14.316 --> 00:35:17.326
So if we read some text
about the resulting actions,

692
00:35:17.886 --> 00:35:19.626
then it's going to be
a little bit safer,

693
00:35:20.006 --> 00:35:21.616
it's more of a guarantee
that people are going

694
00:35:21.616 --> 00:35:22.746
to make the right choice.

695
00:35:23.066 --> 00:35:26.876
And while we're talking
about that, we should avoid

696
00:35:26.996 --> 00:35:30.296
if at all possible, simple
button labels like Yes

697
00:35:30.296 --> 00:35:33.066
and No or OK and Cancel.

698
00:35:33.066 --> 00:35:35.376
If you can get more
specific, please do that.

699
00:35:35.596 --> 00:35:37.246
It's really helpful
for your users.

700
00:35:37.646 --> 00:35:40.916
Now, if you've been paying
really close attention on iOS 7,

701
00:35:40.916 --> 00:35:41.756
you've actually noticed

702
00:35:41.756 --> 00:35:44.156
that that this particular
alert has changed.

703
00:35:45.346 --> 00:35:47.856
We added the option to
snooze when you get an alert.

704
00:35:48.786 --> 00:35:51.156
And rather than cramming
too many choices,

705
00:35:51.866 --> 00:35:54.156
rather than presenting the user

706
00:35:54.156 --> 00:35:55.946
with too many choices
right off the bat,

707
00:35:56.836 --> 00:35:59.336
you're given two many
options, just say OK,

708
00:35:59.696 --> 00:36:03.386
or to look at what options
are available to you and then

709
00:35:59.696 --> 00:36:03.386
or to look at what options
are available to you and then

710
00:36:03.386 --> 00:36:06.716
and only then do we show
Snooze and to View Event.

711
00:36:06.716 --> 00:36:08.766
But again, you can see these
labels are very specific

712
00:36:08.816 --> 00:36:10.706
about what actions
they'll perform.

713
00:36:11.046 --> 00:36:17.716
All right, and I already
talked this a little bit

714
00:36:17.936 --> 00:36:21.586
but put the affirmative
action on the right.

715
00:36:22.336 --> 00:36:25.966
Now, there's a bit of a
disagreement between Apple

716
00:36:25.966 --> 00:36:28.586
and Microsoft about what the
right approach is to do here,

717
00:36:29.006 --> 00:36:33.036
and in fact, sometimes I chuckle
when I go to an ATM or I look

718
00:36:33.036 --> 00:36:36.786
at a website that has this
kind of buttons and I see OK is

719
00:36:36.786 --> 00:36:38.826
on the left or Yes
is on the left.

720
00:36:39.076 --> 00:36:40.256
I know that the designer

721
00:36:40.256 --> 00:36:43.306
who made it is using
a Windows machine.

722
00:36:43.796 --> 00:36:44.726
That's what they're used to.

723
00:36:45.616 --> 00:36:46.546
Now you will too.

724
00:36:47.546 --> 00:36:52.106
And I don't know if we're ever
going to see eye to eye on this.

725
00:36:52.106 --> 00:36:54.476
I hope that Microsoft will
come around and see the error

726
00:36:54.476 --> 00:36:57.946
of their ways but it's
been a couple of decades

727
00:36:57.946 --> 00:36:59.926
so I'm not going
to hold my breath.

728
00:37:00.666 --> 00:37:02.836
So in the meantime, just
recognize that the people

729
00:37:02.836 --> 00:37:06.896
who are using your
apps on iOS are used

730
00:37:06.956 --> 00:37:08.376
to a particular button order.

731
00:37:08.456 --> 00:37:11.046
They're used to the affirmative
actions being on the right,

732
00:37:11.286 --> 00:37:13.296
the forward moving
action being on the right.

733
00:37:13.826 --> 00:37:18.706
And then finally, sometimes an
alert is not the right thing

734
00:37:18.706 --> 00:37:22.046
if someone's about to perform
a potentially destructive

735
00:37:22.616 --> 00:37:23.846
or harmful action.

736
00:37:24.556 --> 00:37:27.336
If you delete this
photo, it's gone for good.

737
00:37:28.316 --> 00:37:31.256
So it's really important
that users are aware

738
00:37:31.256 --> 00:37:32.746
of the consequence
of their actions.

739
00:37:33.956 --> 00:37:38.456
So use an action sheet
in cases like this.

740
00:37:38.686 --> 00:37:40.286
And be sensitive to the order

741
00:37:40.286 --> 00:37:41.826
that you're putting
these buttons in.

742
00:37:42.346 --> 00:37:45.406
The most harmful, the riskiest
action should be at the top,

743
00:37:45.406 --> 00:37:48.476
it should be the furthest away
from where your thumb is if it's

744
00:37:48.476 --> 00:37:51.856
at the bottom of the device,
and it should also colored red

745
00:37:52.756 --> 00:37:54.696
to give you that
reminder, that warning

746
00:37:54.836 --> 00:37:56.436
that there might be
something harmful.

747
00:37:58.206 --> 00:38:01.726
OK, next up, Out-Of-Place
terminology.

748
00:37:58.206 --> 00:38:01.726
OK, next up, Out-Of-Place
terminology.

749
00:38:02.846 --> 00:38:05.826
Now, a big part of making
apps, really easy to use,

750
00:38:05.826 --> 00:38:08.846
really intuitive for a
broad range of users is

751
00:38:08.846 --> 00:38:11.946
to not use jargon, not
use technical terms.

752
00:38:13.136 --> 00:38:14.686
And it's hard for us to remember

753
00:38:14.686 --> 00:38:17.436
that because we're still
comfortable with that language.

754
00:38:17.436 --> 00:38:19.476
We use it all the time and
sometimes these terms are--

755
00:38:20.346 --> 00:38:21.916
allow us to speak
with precision,

756
00:38:22.716 --> 00:38:25.026
clarity amongst ourselves.

757
00:38:25.976 --> 00:38:28.836
Not amongst the general
population.

758
00:38:29.486 --> 00:38:31.926
So we could have called
Airplane Mode Cellular Baseband

759
00:38:32.426 --> 00:38:34.956
but no one would
know what that meant.

760
00:38:35.146 --> 00:38:39.056
Equally, we could have said
Add New GPS Indicator to Map,

761
00:38:39.796 --> 00:38:41.156
but instead, we just
said Drop a Pin,

762
00:38:41.496 --> 00:38:43.686
so much simpler, makes sense.

763
00:38:44.836 --> 00:38:45.406
There we are.

764
00:38:46.016 --> 00:38:46.566
Everyone wave.

765
00:38:47.086 --> 00:38:52.956
And if at all possible,
avoid referring to the files.

766
00:38:54.006 --> 00:38:57.806
iOS tries to obfuscate
the underlying file system

767
00:38:57.806 --> 00:38:58.766
as much as possible.

768
00:38:59.206 --> 00:39:02.936
So in Numbers, they don't
talk about untitled.numbers

769
00:38:59.206 --> 00:39:02.936
So in Numbers, they don't
talk about untitled.numbers

770
00:39:02.936 --> 00:39:05.956
or Create a New File, it's
Make a New Spreadsheet.

771
00:39:06.406 --> 00:39:11.456
Next up, avoid Excessive
Branding.

772
00:39:12.416 --> 00:39:13.826
I see this all the time.

773
00:39:14.916 --> 00:39:15.486
I really do.

774
00:39:15.986 --> 00:39:18.966
And if you show me your app
and it has a logo in it,

775
00:39:18.966 --> 00:39:21.786
you're hear an earful about
why I think that's a bad I idea

776
00:39:22.086 --> 00:39:24.536
because it's usually, the
logo is usually placed

777
00:39:24.536 --> 00:39:26.376
in the nav bar, right
at the top,

778
00:39:26.376 --> 00:39:28.466
right where the title should be.

779
00:39:29.076 --> 00:39:30.966
So, again, WWDC app.

780
00:39:31.236 --> 00:39:32.826
We could have put
the logo up there

781
00:39:33.386 --> 00:39:35.496
but we don't want to do that.

782
00:39:35.496 --> 00:39:39.776
It's a terrible idea
because that space is needed

783
00:39:39.846 --> 00:39:42.696
for showing a title to tell
you what you're looking at,

784
00:39:42.816 --> 00:39:43.926
tell you where you are.

785
00:39:44.546 --> 00:39:49.656
My advice when people say, "Hey,

786
00:39:49.656 --> 00:39:51.146
you know what we
put the logo there

787
00:39:51.146 --> 00:39:53.996
because we think it's important
for building brand recognition."

788
00:39:54.686 --> 00:39:56.916
I said, "That's the
wrong approach in iOS."

789
00:39:57.746 --> 00:40:00.166
Sometimes you see a logo
showing up and you get the sense

790
00:39:57.746 --> 00:40:00.166
Sometimes you see a logo
showing up and you get the sense

791
00:40:00.166 --> 00:40:01.036
that people are thinking

792
00:40:01.036 --> 00:40:03.086
about their app is
though it was a website.

793
00:40:03.146 --> 00:40:06.126
And with a website, showing
your logo actually serves a

794
00:40:06.126 --> 00:40:08.806
functional purpose,
utilitarian purpose.

795
00:40:09.196 --> 00:40:11.346
People can come to your
website from any other place,

796
00:40:11.426 --> 00:40:14.746
though a link or wherever and it
helps them stay oriented to know

797
00:40:14.746 --> 00:40:17.676
that they've gone from one place
to another, know where they are.

798
00:40:18.246 --> 00:40:21.176
But that's not the case in iOS.

799
00:40:21.366 --> 00:40:24.176
In iOS, someone presses your
app icon on the home screen,

800
00:40:24.376 --> 00:40:27.046
they saw your logo
probably at that juncture

801
00:40:27.326 --> 00:40:29.396
and the whole experiences
of your brand.

802
00:40:30.356 --> 00:40:32.956
And if you're now showing
them a logo in place

803
00:40:32.956 --> 00:40:34.796
of showing them some
information which is going to--

804
00:40:35.496 --> 00:40:37.466
the title, which is going
to help them stay oriented

805
00:40:37.466 --> 00:40:38.546
and know what they're
looking at,

806
00:40:38.876 --> 00:40:41.876
then you're degrading their
user experience so they're going

807
00:40:41.876 --> 00:40:45.446
to have a less positive
experience of your brand.

808
00:40:48.336 --> 00:40:51.046
All right, enough about logos.

809
00:40:52.416 --> 00:40:53.916
Uninformative back buttons.

810
00:40:54.826 --> 00:40:58.486
If at all possible, please
label your back buttons

811
00:40:58.486 --> 00:40:59.526
with something informative.

812
00:41:00.956 --> 00:41:02.066
We don't do this.

813
00:41:02.856 --> 00:41:06.256
We're in Settings and this
back button just says Back.

814
00:41:07.036 --> 00:41:08.836
The error tells me
it's a back button.

815
00:41:09.166 --> 00:41:11.156
I don't need text to tell
me I'm going to go back.

816
00:41:11.856 --> 00:41:13.746
Now, I see a lot
of this and a lot

817
00:41:13.746 --> 00:41:15.146
of times the explanation
is that, well,

818
00:41:15.146 --> 00:41:18.366
we don't have enough
space to display the title

819
00:41:18.366 --> 00:41:22.886
of the parent view, but
look at changing the title

820
00:41:22.886 --> 00:41:25.956
of the parent view or the
child view to make that space

821
00:41:26.246 --> 00:41:28.646
because it's a really
important way to allow people

822
00:41:28.896 --> 00:41:31.226
to have context, to
know where they are.

823
00:41:31.226 --> 00:41:37.986
All right, there's a connection
between the back button

824
00:41:38.286 --> 00:41:39.916
and the title of
the previous view.

825
00:41:41.386 --> 00:41:46.176
And what's more to iOS 7, we
have this really nifty animation

826
00:41:46.516 --> 00:41:48.456
that makes that connection
very clear.

827
00:41:49.356 --> 00:41:50.606
So if your back button
said Back,

828
00:41:51.696 --> 00:41:53.246
this wouldn't work very well.

829
00:41:53.826 --> 00:41:58.896
So, for example, if we just
said Back here, we wouldn't know

830
00:41:58.896 --> 00:41:59.906
where we're going to back to.

831
00:42:00.686 --> 00:42:05.386
We're looking at the info for an
event but where would I go back

832
00:42:05.496 --> 00:42:06.936
to if I press that button?

833
00:42:07.896 --> 00:42:10.596
Now, in actuality, what
we have is sets of events.

834
00:42:11.036 --> 00:42:13.286
I'm just going to point
this out a little bit

835
00:42:13.286 --> 00:42:15.456
because there's actually no
title in that parent view.

836
00:42:15.906 --> 00:42:18.766
It's a segmented control
for filtering favorites

837
00:42:18.766 --> 00:42:21.646
or just showing every event
for the schedule this week.

838
00:42:22.316 --> 00:42:26.036
But it does connect to
the tab, the Events tab,

839
00:42:26.326 --> 00:42:27.466
so it still makes sense.

840
00:42:27.466 --> 00:42:31.556
All right, that was
the Back button.

841
00:42:31.916 --> 00:42:34.346
Onto the second to
last common pitfall

842
00:42:34.866 --> 00:42:36.636
which is Confusing Animations.

843
00:42:38.106 --> 00:42:39.486
Now I see this all the time.

844
00:42:40.006 --> 00:42:44.656
This is Stocks, and when you
bring up the settings UI,

845
00:42:45.726 --> 00:42:47.466
it animates up, slides up.

846
00:42:48.306 --> 00:42:50.906
And when you dismiss
it, slides down.

847
00:42:51.496 --> 00:42:55.136
It's really basic,
really straightforward.

848
00:42:55.136 --> 00:42:55.886
It's symmetrical.

849
00:42:55.936 --> 00:42:56.986
It makes sense.

850
00:42:56.986 --> 00:43:00.286
So now, when it comes again,
we're going to figure it's going

851
00:42:56.986 --> 00:43:00.286
So now, when it comes again,
we're going to figure it's going

852
00:43:00.286 --> 00:43:01.696
to come up from the
bottom because that

853
00:43:01.746 --> 00:43:03.636
where it seems to have gone to.

854
00:43:04.236 --> 00:43:06.486
It's persistence.

855
00:43:07.566 --> 00:43:10.046
We imagine it'll still be
there down at the bottom.

856
00:43:11.416 --> 00:43:16.016
Sometimes, things will slide
up and then they keep on going.

857
00:43:16.016 --> 00:43:19.326
Where did they go?

858
00:43:20.466 --> 00:43:23.146
Apparently, they're going to
fly all the way around the world

859
00:43:23.296 --> 00:43:24.836
and come back to the bottom

860
00:43:24.836 --> 00:43:27.926
so that they're there
the next time.

861
00:43:28.136 --> 00:43:32.526
Sometimes, you slide up the
Settings and you dismiss it

862
00:43:32.706 --> 00:43:33.686
and it just disappears.

863
00:43:34.796 --> 00:43:35.746
That doesn't feel right.

864
00:43:35.746 --> 00:43:39.816
It feels like they just forgot
to do the animation to go away.

865
00:43:41.656 --> 00:43:45.926
Sometimes, bring up Settings

866
00:43:46.036 --> 00:43:48.666
and you get something
totally different.

867
00:43:49.496 --> 00:43:53.646
This is-- I picked this one
because Keynote let me do it.

868
00:43:55.226 --> 00:43:58.056
And an iris wipe, that
might have made sense

869
00:43:58.126 --> 00:44:00.946
but it should have come
on in the same way.

870
00:43:58.126 --> 00:44:00.946
but it should have come
on in the same way.

871
00:44:01.496 --> 00:44:03.336
OK, it would have been a
really bad idea no matter

872
00:44:03.606 --> 00:44:05.096
but you guys get point.

873
00:44:06.036 --> 00:44:11.336
And then sometimes, you just
get gratuitous animation.

874
00:44:12.256 --> 00:44:16.146
It's distracting.

875
00:44:16.596 --> 00:44:17.486
It's unnecessary.

876
00:44:18.816 --> 00:44:20.176
All right, enough
about animation.

877
00:44:21.376 --> 00:44:24.096
So I'm going to end on
Inappropriate Styling.

878
00:44:24.686 --> 00:44:27.576
Now, there's a lot of apps

879
00:44:27.576 --> 00:44:30.326
that have a very distinct
visual style for them.

880
00:44:30.856 --> 00:44:35.216
They might have some real world
materials like wood or fabric

881
00:44:35.776 --> 00:44:41.696
and maybe you're making an app
that's for high school students

882
00:44:41.696 --> 00:44:43.426
who are learning
about woodworking,

883
00:44:43.546 --> 00:44:44.586
learning about carpentry.

884
00:44:45.856 --> 00:44:50.566
So maybe the appropriate
background is a wood,

885
00:44:50.566 --> 00:44:54.866
kind of cartoonish texture,
it makes total sense.

886
00:44:55.726 --> 00:44:56.506
It'd be appropriate.

887
00:44:57.396 --> 00:44:59.666
But the key to understanding how

888
00:44:59.666 --> 00:45:02.296
to stylize your app
appropriately starts

889
00:44:59.666 --> 00:45:02.296
to stylize your app
appropriately starts

890
00:45:02.296 --> 00:45:04.496
with understanding
your intention.

891
00:45:05.416 --> 00:45:08.136
So in everything I just said
right now, I had a picture

892
00:45:08.136 --> 00:45:09.576
of who the app was for.

893
00:45:10.486 --> 00:45:13.096
I limited it down to
particular age group

894
00:45:13.296 --> 00:45:17.646
who had a particular set of
interests, and I picked a style

895
00:45:17.716 --> 00:45:19.246
that was relevant to them.

896
00:45:19.416 --> 00:45:20.256
That made sense.

897
00:45:20.256 --> 00:45:21.346
It was a logical fit.

898
00:45:22.576 --> 00:45:25.796
So let's look at some examples,
I think, of appropriate styling.

899
00:45:26.296 --> 00:45:31.896
This is the UI for ProCreate,
one of the ADA winners.

900
00:45:32.466 --> 00:45:34.496
I feel like I'm shilling
for ADA winners.

901
00:45:35.286 --> 00:45:37.086
This is an appropriately
styled app.

902
00:45:38.026 --> 00:45:39.006
It's a wonderful app.

903
00:45:39.846 --> 00:45:44.226
Now every aspect, every decision
that they made around the design

904
00:45:44.226 --> 00:45:48.136
of their UI was done so for
a very specific purpose.

905
00:45:48.636 --> 00:45:52.396
This is a real tool
for real artists

906
00:45:52.606 --> 00:45:54.856
and real illustrators
to do real work.

907
00:45:56.106 --> 00:45:59.436
And that user base, they have
some very specific needs.

908
00:46:00.606 --> 00:46:03.706
You want to make sure that
your UI doesn't distract

909
00:46:03.936 --> 00:46:07.716
from your ability to see all of
the great details in the drawing

910
00:46:07.716 --> 00:46:11.446
that you're making, so it's
dark, doesn't interfere

911
00:46:11.446 --> 00:46:13.576
with that, doesn't jump
out in front of it.

912
00:46:14.176 --> 00:46:16.416
And I talked about that
on Wednesday, deference.

913
00:46:17.166 --> 00:46:20.166
This, I think, displays that
characteristic, it's deferential

914
00:46:20.256 --> 00:46:21.166
to the user's content.

915
00:46:21.166 --> 00:46:25.516
And it's got a texture to
it but the texture is matte.

916
00:46:26.536 --> 00:46:28.086
If they went with
something glossy,

917
00:46:28.446 --> 00:46:31.476
then they would have these
horizon lines in the reflections

918
00:46:31.476 --> 00:46:34.176
and it would add to the
noisiness of the UI.

919
00:46:35.256 --> 00:46:36.716
So it's appropriately styled.

920
00:46:36.716 --> 00:46:39.346
Let's look at another example.

921
00:46:40.636 --> 00:46:41.916
WWF Together.

922
00:46:42.886 --> 00:46:47.086
Beautiful app and the theme of
the app is based on origami.

923
00:46:48.406 --> 00:46:51.666
You'd make these origami animals
and then you can share those

924
00:46:51.906 --> 00:46:54.516
with your friends on
Facebook or email or Twitter.

925
00:46:55.316 --> 00:46:58.446
And they took that feature,
they took that concept

926
00:46:58.846 --> 00:47:01.526
and they applied it and
used it as the style

927
00:46:58.846 --> 00:47:01.526
and they applied it and
used it as the style

928
00:47:01.526 --> 00:47:02.636
of everything in the UI.

929
00:47:02.636 --> 00:47:07.576
So this menu system, it
unfolds like pieces of paper,

930
00:47:08.336 --> 00:47:11.356
and the background, it's a
little bit hard to see here

931
00:47:11.356 --> 00:47:13.656
but it's got this
triangle shapes different--

932
00:47:13.856 --> 00:47:17.776
subtly different variations of
light gray to really reinforce

933
00:47:17.776 --> 00:47:20.436
that idea that this
is unfolded origami.

934
00:47:21.646 --> 00:47:22.836
And it totally works.

935
00:47:23.046 --> 00:47:25.336
This is an appropriate style
and it's totally unique.

936
00:47:25.596 --> 00:47:27.246
It made sense, it's original.

937
00:47:28.316 --> 00:47:29.966
Really original.

938
00:47:31.276 --> 00:47:36.216
So imagine, if WWF Together
looked like ProCreate,

939
00:47:36.726 --> 00:47:39.866
it was dark serious app.

940
00:47:40.466 --> 00:47:45.786
Would that work for the purpose
of WWF Together or visa versa?

941
00:47:46.386 --> 00:47:49.656
You would want ProCreate
to have this bright white

942
00:47:49.656 --> 00:47:51.406
origami interface.

943
00:47:51.796 --> 00:47:53.096
It'd be really distracting.

944
00:47:54.696 --> 00:47:58.006
So let's look at a specific
example of something

945
00:47:58.006 --> 00:47:59.816
which would be an
inappropriate style.

946
00:48:01.276 --> 00:48:03.686
So this is photos from iOS 6.

947
00:48:04.236 --> 00:48:06.116
If it had a wood background.

948
00:48:06.916 --> 00:48:10.236
Now, at first blush, this
might look really pretty.

949
00:48:10.286 --> 00:48:12.036
I think it's a nice texture,

950
00:48:12.036 --> 00:48:13.616
I mean there's nothing
wrong with that texture.

951
00:48:13.946 --> 00:48:14.526
It looks awesome.

952
00:48:15.936 --> 00:48:19.506
But it competes with
the photos themselves.

953
00:48:19.816 --> 00:48:21.476
It interferes with your ability

954
00:48:21.856 --> 00:48:25.826
to see clearly the content
that you care about.

955
00:48:26.426 --> 00:48:28.046
It's not deferential.

956
00:48:29.076 --> 00:48:34.496
So the real UI for iPhoto on iOS
6 or for Photos on iOS 6, sorry,

957
00:48:35.186 --> 00:48:36.676
just has a plain
black background.

958
00:48:38.066 --> 00:48:42.336
That's not really a theme
per se but it makes it easy

959
00:48:42.336 --> 00:48:45.356
to see the photos and that's
what's really important.

960
00:48:45.926 --> 00:48:50.426
So, again, you have to
think about your intent.

961
00:48:51.376 --> 00:48:54.656
Now, that's generally good
advice for anything you do

962
00:48:55.406 --> 00:48:57.586
and especially with
design of your product,

963
00:48:58.826 --> 00:49:00.806
but that's just the first step.

964
00:48:58.826 --> 00:49:00.806
but that's just the first step.

965
00:49:01.576 --> 00:49:06.466
So, the designers of ProCreate,
they probably started saying,

966
00:49:06.866 --> 00:49:07.946
"OK, who's our app for?"

967
00:49:08.356 --> 00:49:09.026
It's for artists.

968
00:49:09.126 --> 00:49:10.536
"But what do they need?"

969
00:49:10.756 --> 00:49:13.286
They needed a UI which
is functional, efficient,

970
00:49:13.776 --> 00:49:16.236
gives them quick access
to tools, doesn't distract

971
00:49:16.236 --> 00:49:17.726
from the content that
they're creating.

972
00:49:18.266 --> 00:49:20.776
Well, what works for that?

973
00:49:20.966 --> 00:49:21.726
Dark palette.

974
00:49:22.326 --> 00:49:24.496
Let's look at some similar
apps, what did they do?

975
00:49:24.496 --> 00:49:26.616
What are the characteristics
of those apps?

976
00:49:27.376 --> 00:49:30.586
So there's a progression of
considerations that you have

977
00:49:30.656 --> 00:49:37.036
to go through but nowhere
in there is an allowance

978
00:49:37.336 --> 00:49:42.106
for saying, "I just
like wood textures.

979
00:49:42.456 --> 00:49:43.406
I think it looks pretty."

980
00:49:44.086 --> 00:49:47.766
You have to avoid doing that
and think about something

981
00:49:47.766 --> 00:49:49.546
which is appropriate
for your users.

982
00:49:50.566 --> 00:49:52.216
It makes sense for
them and your product.

983
00:49:53.186 --> 00:49:56.256
So those are the 10 common
pitfalls that I see all

984
00:49:56.256 --> 00:49:58.236
of the time in iOS apps.

985
00:49:59.146 --> 00:50:00.786
If you can avoid doing
these things, you're going

986
00:49:59.146 --> 00:50:00.786
If you can avoid doing
these things, you're going

987
00:50:00.786 --> 00:50:01.826
to be in really good shape.

988
00:50:01.916 --> 00:50:07.556
So, I'm just going to
give a plug for the HIG.

989
00:50:08.146 --> 00:50:10.976
I'm just really scratching the
surface with these 10 pitfalls.

990
00:50:11.616 --> 00:50:14.436
There is wealth of
fantastic information here

991
00:50:15.026 --> 00:50:19.116
which you can use to reference
and learn all about how

992
00:50:19.116 --> 00:50:22.976
to use controls and what rules
to follow, what things to avoid.

993
00:50:23.036 --> 00:50:26.716
I really urge you to read it, it
can be kind of dense at times.

994
00:50:27.766 --> 00:50:30.006
I know it's not the most
approachable document

995
00:50:30.006 --> 00:50:33.796
in the world and we're working
on that, but it's fantastic.

996
00:50:34.276 --> 00:50:35.796
I've been designing
for many years.

997
00:50:36.006 --> 00:50:38.586
I worked with people who
are equally experienced

998
00:50:38.816 --> 00:50:41.036
and we're always
referencing this document,

999
00:50:41.366 --> 00:50:43.746
we're always pointing each
other in the direction

1000
00:50:43.746 --> 00:50:47.056
of some particular passage which
gives us guidance about how

1001
00:50:47.056 --> 00:50:48.896
to do our job correctly.

1002
00:50:49.476 --> 00:50:52.086
I have some final thoughts.

1003
00:50:53.336 --> 00:50:57.136
Actually, I just have one
final thought, which is focus.

1004
00:50:58.696 --> 00:51:04.146
Now, when we were designing
the WWDC app, we could have put

1005
00:50:58.696 --> 00:51:04.146
Now, when we were designing
the WWDC app, we could have put

1006
00:51:04.146 --> 00:51:07.486
in all sorts of great
features, or all sorts

1007
00:51:07.486 --> 00:51:11.486
of additional features like
the ability for you developers

1008
00:51:11.486 --> 00:51:13.016
to network with each other

1009
00:51:13.356 --> 00:51:15.336
or to check the current
weather conditions

1010
00:51:15.646 --> 00:51:18.696
or provide a guide for,
you know, restaurants,

1011
00:51:18.696 --> 00:51:20.706
clubs or whatever
in San Francisco,

1012
00:51:20.846 --> 00:51:24.716
but we didn't do those things
because it would've detracted

1013
00:51:25.026 --> 00:51:28.146
from our core focus
which was to add videos

1014
00:51:28.936 --> 00:51:30.226
and to integrate Passbook.

1015
00:51:30.936 --> 00:51:34.856
And we have a team of some
pretty capable engineers

1016
00:51:34.856 --> 00:51:38.976
and designers who
are working on this,

1017
00:51:39.196 --> 00:51:42.226
but despite that,
this is hard work.

1018
00:51:42.226 --> 00:51:46.296
And in order to make those
features really work great

1019
00:51:46.296 --> 00:51:49.216
on the app, we had
to concentrate on it

1020
00:51:50.306 --> 00:51:52.256
and not get distracted by
doing all these things.

1021
00:51:53.376 --> 00:51:54.576
And that's my advice to you.

1022
00:51:55.306 --> 00:51:57.176
It's to not bite off
more than you can chew.

1023
00:51:57.996 --> 00:52:01.236
Figure out what your app can be
really great at and it's going

1024
00:51:57.996 --> 00:52:01.236
Figure out what your app can be
really great at and it's going

1025
00:52:01.236 --> 00:52:05.876
to just be one thing or two
things, and then devote all

1026
00:52:05.876 --> 00:52:09.196
of your energy to making
sure that that's rock solid,

1027
00:52:09.676 --> 00:52:10.866
that that's a better feature

1028
00:52:10.866 --> 00:52:12.706
than anyone else
in your category.

1029
00:52:13.976 --> 00:52:14.746
It's hard work.

1030
00:52:14.746 --> 00:52:18.006
Some of the things
we looked at up here,

1031
00:52:18.256 --> 00:52:19.566
they're not easy to achieve.

1032
00:52:20.516 --> 00:52:22.196
In fact, a lot of
times, it's important

1033
00:52:22.196 --> 00:52:24.476
to recognize the limit
of your capabilities.

1034
00:52:25.246 --> 00:52:27.776
Hire a designer to
do your app icon.

1035
00:52:28.776 --> 00:52:30.346
Hire a designer to do
your app interface.

1036
00:52:30.346 --> 00:52:34.756
This is complex stuff to really
get right, but if you want

1037
00:52:34.756 --> 00:52:36.936
to stand out on App
Store, if you want your app

1038
00:52:36.936 --> 00:52:41.116
to be really successful,
that's what it takes.

1039
00:52:41.276 --> 00:52:44.466
So, again, focus on
what you can do well

1040
00:52:44.526 --> 00:52:46.666
and knock it out
of the ballpark.

1041
00:52:48.166 --> 00:52:49.006
That's all I've got.

1042
00:52:49.396 --> 00:52:50.496
Thank you very much.
