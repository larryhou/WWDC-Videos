00:00:00.506 --> 00:00:09.926
[ Silence ]

2
00:00:10.426 --> 00:00:12.096
>> Welcome to Accessibility
in iOS.

3
00:00:12.096 --> 00:00:13.976
My name is Sam White, I am one

4
00:00:13.976 --> 00:00:15.986
of the iOS Accessibility
Engineers here at Apple.

5
00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:17.576
Today, I want to talk to you

6
00:00:17.576 --> 00:00:20.296
about developing great
applications for everyone.

7
00:00:20.646 --> 00:00:21.816
And I want to show you how to do

8
00:00:21.816 --> 00:00:23.636
that by implementing
a little bit

9
00:00:23.636 --> 00:00:25.326
of Accessibility in
your applications.

10
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:29.676
So before we get
started, what do we mean

11
00:00:29.676 --> 00:00:32.026
when we say Accessibility
in this context?

12
00:00:32.296 --> 00:00:34.796
Well, in iOS, Accessibility
is really

13
00:00:34.796 --> 00:00:37.196
about supporting different
abilities and more broadly

14
00:00:37.196 --> 00:00:38.776
than that, supporting
different users.

15
00:00:39.176 --> 00:00:41.496
So, if you look at the
iPad and the iPhone,

16
00:00:41.496 --> 00:00:44.366
you see these amazing
devices, you know, they help--

17
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:46.576
they let you communicate
with your friends,

18
00:00:46.576 --> 00:00:48.076
watch movies, browse
the internet.

19
00:00:48.416 --> 00:00:51.786
But the user experience of these
devices is very much one size

20
00:00:51.786 --> 00:00:52.336
fits all.

21
00:00:53.316 --> 00:00:56.566
And so, if we look at, you know,
two users of these devices,

22
00:00:56.726 --> 00:00:58.486
no two users are
the same, you know,

23
00:00:58.486 --> 00:00:59.626
so this is the problem we have.

24
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.206
And more specifically,

25
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.206
And more specifically,

26
00:01:01.556 --> 00:01:04.775
no two users have the exact
same abilities so this is

27
00:01:04.775 --> 00:01:06.336
where Accessibility
comes in on iOS.

28
00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:10.166
Accessibility is the thin
layer that sits between you

29
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:13.136
and your device and it
transforms your input

30
00:01:13.236 --> 00:01:15.906
into something more appropriate
for the device and similarly,

31
00:01:15.906 --> 00:01:17.796
it transforms the
device's output

32
00:01:17.796 --> 00:01:19.536
into something more
appropriate for you.

33
00:01:20.206 --> 00:01:24.076
So today's talk is broken
into two main parts,

34
00:01:24.076 --> 00:01:27.856
I'm going to start by giving
you a brief introduction to some

35
00:01:28.036 --> 00:01:30.406
of the Accessibility
features that we offer on iOS.

36
00:01:30.826 --> 00:01:32.256
And this should give you an idea

37
00:01:32.256 --> 00:01:35.226
of how users will experience
your accessible application.

38
00:01:35.896 --> 00:01:37.416
And while we're at
it, I'm really excited

39
00:01:37.416 --> 00:01:40.606
to say we're adding a brand new
Accessibility feature in iOS 7

40
00:01:40.876 --> 00:01:42.206
so I'm really excited
to show you that.

41
00:01:42.206 --> 00:01:44.946
And then for the remainder
of our time and really,

42
00:01:44.946 --> 00:01:46.276
the bulk of the talk,

43
00:01:46.276 --> 00:01:48.376
we're going to be doing some
Accessibility development.

44
00:01:48.616 --> 00:01:49.786
So, I've brought an
application with me

45
00:01:49.786 --> 00:01:51.396
that has some Accessibility
issues.

46
00:01:51.756 --> 00:01:53.516
So, we're going to fix
them kind of from--

47
00:01:53.876 --> 00:01:55.536
starting with the most
basic, working our way

48
00:01:55.536 --> 00:01:57.516
up to the advanced
issues then I'm going

49
00:01:57.516 --> 00:01:59.616
to use some brand new
API on this application

50
00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:02.536
that we've added in this release
to do some really cool stuff

51
00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:02.536
that we've added in this release
to do some really cool stuff

52
00:02:02.536 --> 00:02:04.056
that was never before
possible and it's going

53
00:02:04.056 --> 00:02:05.646
to let you do some cool
stuff in your applications.

54
00:02:05.646 --> 00:02:08.376
And then, we're going to
wrap up the day by looking

55
00:02:08.376 --> 00:02:10.205
at some brand new
API we've added

56
00:02:10.256 --> 00:02:11.826
to Guided Access
in this release.

57
00:02:11.826 --> 00:02:14.106
And I'm going to show you
how you can use that API

58
00:02:14.686 --> 00:02:16.366
to really customize
the user experience

59
00:02:16.486 --> 00:02:17.756
of your application on the fly.

60
00:02:18.576 --> 00:02:20.506
So, iOS Accessibility features.

61
00:02:20.886 --> 00:02:23.316
One of our most powerful
features is called VoiceOver

62
00:02:23.626 --> 00:02:27.496
and VoiceOver is a screen reader
application that lets blind

63
00:02:27.596 --> 00:02:30.376
and low vision users
use iOS in the same way

64
00:02:30.376 --> 00:02:31.366
that everyone else does.

65
00:02:31.736 --> 00:02:35.286
And so, VoiceOver works
by intercepting all touch

66
00:02:35.336 --> 00:02:38.956
and Multi-Touch gestures and
transforming those into commands

67
00:02:38.956 --> 00:02:40.886
that drive a cursor
around the screen,

68
00:02:41.166 --> 00:02:42.426
the cursor you see
in this image.

69
00:02:43.666 --> 00:02:45.916
And so, what that does
is it allows a blind

70
00:02:45.916 --> 00:02:49.966
or low vision user to explore
an interface and have it spoken

71
00:02:49.966 --> 00:02:53.226
to them to learn about it before
they chose to interact with it.

72
00:02:54.566 --> 00:02:57.866
We also added a feature in
iOS 6 called Guided Access.

73
00:02:58.226 --> 00:03:00.316
So we introduce Guided
Access to deal

74
00:02:58.226 --> 00:03:00.316
So we introduce Guided
Access to deal

75
00:03:00.316 --> 00:03:01.996
with the problem
of distractions.

76
00:03:02.246 --> 00:03:04.906
So if we return to, looking
at the iPhone and the iPad,

77
00:03:05.266 --> 00:03:07.586
we realized these devices
have a great number

78
00:03:07.586 --> 00:03:09.116
of distractions associated
with them.

79
00:03:09.326 --> 00:03:11.876
If we look at the hardware,
they have many hardware buttons,

80
00:03:11.876 --> 00:03:13.296
you know, volume
buttons, lock buttons

81
00:03:13.296 --> 00:03:16.756
and the interface itself
responds to, you know,

82
00:03:16.756 --> 00:03:18.616
a variety of touch and
Multi-Touch gestures.

83
00:03:18.976 --> 00:03:21.606
And what this means is, if
you're a user who, you know,

84
00:03:21.606 --> 00:03:23.396
maybe has trouble
focusing or a child,

85
00:03:23.726 --> 00:03:25.436
these distractions can
really get in your way.

86
00:03:25.726 --> 00:03:30.106
And so, what Guided Access does
is it gives you a setup screen

87
00:03:30.106 --> 00:03:31.506
that allows you to remove many

88
00:03:31.506 --> 00:03:33.476
of these distractions
on a per app basis.

89
00:03:33.846 --> 00:03:36.816
So, you can really focus in on
exactly the content you want to.

90
00:03:39.316 --> 00:03:42.106
Also in iOS 6, we added Made
for iPhone hearing aids.

91
00:03:42.576 --> 00:03:44.976
And so, Made for iPhone hearing
aids let you control your

92
00:03:44.976 --> 00:03:46.776
hearing aids right
from your iOS device

93
00:03:46.776 --> 00:03:48.126
which you likely
already have with you.

94
00:03:48.386 --> 00:03:51.026
And so, this let you do
things like adjust the volume

95
00:03:51.026 --> 00:03:53.156
or adjust the balance
between your hearing aids

96
00:03:53.156 --> 00:03:54.106
if you have more than one.

97
00:03:54.476 --> 00:03:56.046
I mean it even lets
you quickly select

98
00:03:56.046 --> 00:03:59.926
from multiple audiologist
tuned presets that you have

99
00:03:59.926 --> 00:04:01.816
in your hearing aid
and on your device.

100
00:03:59.926 --> 00:04:01.816
in your hearing aid
and on your device.

101
00:04:02.116 --> 00:04:04.716
So, if you walk into say a noisy
environment like a restaurant,

102
00:04:04.716 --> 00:04:06.876
you know, you can quickly
change your hearing aid

103
00:04:06.916 --> 00:04:08.596
to an equalizer setting
more appropriate

104
00:04:08.596 --> 00:04:09.276
for that environment.

105
00:04:09.276 --> 00:04:11.946
And similarly, maybe if
you walk into a movie,

106
00:04:11.946 --> 00:04:14.536
a very quiet environment, you
can again pull out your iPhone

107
00:04:14.536 --> 00:04:16.716
and quickly choose a
preset more appropriate

108
00:04:16.716 --> 00:04:17.375
for that environment.

109
00:04:17.896 --> 00:04:20.516
And the last Accessibility
feature,

110
00:04:20.606 --> 00:04:22.246
I wanted to give you kind
of a brief introduction

111
00:04:22.246 --> 00:04:24.176
to today is called
Assistive Touch.

112
00:04:24.636 --> 00:04:28.216
So, we added a Assistive
Touch to iOS in iOS 5.

113
00:04:28.626 --> 00:04:34.626
And really, the goal of
Assistive Touch is to help users

114
00:04:34.666 --> 00:04:38.346
with physical and mobility
impairments perform the complex

115
00:04:38.346 --> 00:04:40.536
Multi-Touch gestures and
hardware button presses

116
00:04:40.756 --> 00:04:43.406
that are really necessarily
to use iOS effectively.

117
00:04:43.686 --> 00:04:44.896
And so, Assistive
Touch does this

118
00:04:44.896 --> 00:04:48.106
by giving you a single
on-screen menu

119
00:04:48.436 --> 00:04:51.506
that contains all these gestures
and hardware button options.

120
00:04:51.846 --> 00:04:53.966
And can be activated
by just a single touch.

121
00:04:54.446 --> 00:04:57.536
And also, Assistive Touch can
be driven using an external

122
00:04:57.536 --> 00:04:59.636
Accessibility device
such as a joystick.

123
00:04:59.636 --> 00:05:03.106
So, I want to return
to this idea

124
00:04:59.636 --> 00:05:03.106
So, I want to return
to this idea

125
00:05:03.106 --> 00:05:04.776
of supporting different
abilities

126
00:05:04.776 --> 00:05:06.276
with Accessibility for a moment.

127
00:05:06.646 --> 00:05:07.966
Now that we've seen some

128
00:05:07.966 --> 00:05:09.876
of the more visible
Accessibility features,

129
00:05:10.256 --> 00:05:11.436
this starts to make
sense, right?

130
00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:15.516
We introduced Guided Access to
offer some cognitive support,

131
00:05:15.706 --> 00:05:18.026
we have VoiceOver that
offers visual support

132
00:05:18.336 --> 00:05:20.866
and so the question arises,
you know, where do we go next?

133
00:05:20.866 --> 00:05:21.676
Over the years, we've built

134
00:05:21.676 --> 00:05:24.616
up a pretty rich
Accessibility environment on iOS

135
00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:25.746
and it's really second to none.

136
00:05:26.166 --> 00:05:27.906
And so, to answer that
question of where we go next,

137
00:05:28.166 --> 00:05:30.066
I want to explain the picture
you see in front of you.

138
00:05:30.396 --> 00:05:34.766
And what you're seeing is
what's known as a Switch User

139
00:05:35.166 --> 00:05:39.246
and switch software is designed
to allow a user to interface

140
00:05:39.246 --> 00:05:41.936
with the computing device
using just a single switch.

141
00:05:42.326 --> 00:05:44.786
And so, this is accomplish
by scanning

142
00:05:44.786 --> 00:05:47.696
through the interface
automatically and listening

143
00:05:47.766 --> 00:05:50.496
for those switch presses
from a user, you know,

144
00:05:50.496 --> 00:05:53.526
when the thing they are
interested in, you know,

145
00:05:53.526 --> 00:05:55.736
becomes selected via
the scanning process.

146
00:05:56.486 --> 00:05:59.096
And so, as you may have guessed,
I'm really excited to say

147
00:05:59.096 --> 00:06:01.086
that we've worked really
hard, you know, day and night

148
00:05:59.096 --> 00:06:01.086
that we've worked really
hard, you know, day and night

149
00:06:01.576 --> 00:06:03.956
and we've gone ahead and baked
a complete switch software

150
00:06:03.956 --> 00:06:05.986
solution right into
iOS in this release.

151
00:06:06.646 --> 00:06:09.146
And so rather than talk
about it, you know,

152
00:06:09.146 --> 00:06:10.226
a picture is worth
a thousand words,

153
00:06:10.486 --> 00:06:12.146
I'd love to just give you
a quick demo right now.

154
00:06:12.846 --> 00:06:16.266
As with all of our Accessibility
features, you can find them

155
00:06:16.266 --> 00:06:20.466
by opening up the Settings
application, go into General

156
00:06:21.986 --> 00:06:23.856
and then to Accessibility.

157
00:06:24.806 --> 00:06:26.266
And so, as I mentioned before,

158
00:06:26.266 --> 00:06:28.246
you can see that the
Accessibility features

159
00:06:28.246 --> 00:06:29.916
on iOS are really
grouped by needs.

160
00:06:30.186 --> 00:06:32.336
So, we see the vision
heading followed

161
00:06:32.336 --> 00:06:34.636
by the vision related
Accessibility features,

162
00:06:34.926 --> 00:06:36.836
similarly hearing
and hearing features.

163
00:06:37.036 --> 00:06:38.956
And if we scroll all the way
down, we see physical and motor

164
00:06:39.126 --> 00:06:40.706
and that's where
switch control lives.

165
00:06:41.546 --> 00:06:44.016
And so, before I turn it on, I
just want to scroll down a bit

166
00:06:44.016 --> 00:06:47.536
and give you an idea of how
customizable this feature is.

167
00:06:47.866 --> 00:06:50.516
Again, we think it's really
important for each user

168
00:06:50.516 --> 00:06:53.836
to be able to tune this feature
to really meet their abilities

169
00:06:53.836 --> 00:06:55.326
and work with-- work
well with them.

170
00:06:55.716 --> 00:06:57.876
And so again, we've built
in an incredible amount

171
00:06:57.876 --> 00:07:01.266
of customization here so users
can really set it up in a way

172
00:06:57.876 --> 00:07:01.266
of customization here so users
can really set it up in a way

173
00:07:01.266 --> 00:07:02.116
that works well for them.

174
00:07:02.706 --> 00:07:06.206
And so, if I go ahead and
turn Switch control on,

175
00:07:06.756 --> 00:07:09.516
you can see a cursor that begins
scanning through the interface.

176
00:07:09.826 --> 00:07:12.016
And so, this in itself
is pretty amazing, right?

177
00:07:12.796 --> 00:07:14.886
If you've seen Switch
software before, usually,

178
00:07:15.186 --> 00:07:18.876
the solution is to, you know,
drive-- if you're on a desktop,

179
00:07:18.876 --> 00:07:21.276
it's to drive a mouse
cursor around the interface.

180
00:07:21.596 --> 00:07:23.196
And, you know, if
you're on mobile device,

181
00:07:23.476 --> 00:07:26.336
maybe you drive some false
finger around the interface.

182
00:07:26.726 --> 00:07:29.376
But because of your help in
years passed and, you know,

183
00:07:29.376 --> 00:07:32.426
our work on the OS end, we've
already marked up the interfaces

184
00:07:32.426 --> 00:07:34.456
with this great Accessibility
API.

185
00:07:34.456 --> 00:07:36.556
And so, we can just jump
in and leverage to that API

186
00:07:36.816 --> 00:07:38.276
and build this feature
on top of it

187
00:07:38.276 --> 00:07:39.596
because we know these
elements exist.

188
00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:40.986
And so, that's how we were able

189
00:07:40.986 --> 00:07:43.536
to build an element
scanning switch solution.

190
00:07:44.726 --> 00:07:46.666
And so now, this
cursor is scanning

191
00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:48.316
through the interface
waiting for switch presses.

192
00:07:48.616 --> 00:07:50.266
And so, ahead of
time, I've gone ahead

193
00:07:50.266 --> 00:07:54.556
and paired my external Bluetooth
switch with this device

194
00:07:54.776 --> 00:07:56.336
and right out-- right
off the bat,

195
00:07:56.336 --> 00:08:00.176
we're supporting a large
number of external switches

196
00:07:56.336 --> 00:08:00.176
we're supporting a large
number of external switches

197
00:08:00.176 --> 00:08:01.056
that will work for you.

198
00:08:01.246 --> 00:08:05.466
And so, as this cursor scans the
interface, I wait for, you know,

199
00:08:05.466 --> 00:08:07.146
what I'm interested
in to be selected,

200
00:08:07.336 --> 00:08:10.746
and then I can press my switch
to bring up a context menu.

201
00:08:11.136 --> 00:08:13.056
And so if I bring up the
context menu here, you can see,

202
00:08:13.056 --> 00:08:14.986
I'm presented with options

203
00:08:14.986 --> 00:08:16.636
that are appropriate
for this element.

204
00:08:16.986 --> 00:08:18.816
And in this case, I'm
just going to wait

205
00:08:18.816 --> 00:08:21.286
until the Home button group
becomes selected and I'm going

206
00:08:21.286 --> 00:08:22.936
to drill into it with
a single switch press.

207
00:08:23.486 --> 00:08:27.396
And then again, press
right on the Home button

208
00:08:27.396 --> 00:08:29.186
and you can see it's
the equivalent

209
00:08:29.186 --> 00:08:30.596
of just pressing the
Home button yourself.

210
00:08:31.406 --> 00:08:34.446
And so, let's say we want
to take a look at, you know,

211
00:08:34.446 --> 00:08:35.686
how Apple stock is doing today.

212
00:08:35.806 --> 00:08:39.736
And so again, we'll just wait
until the group with stocks

213
00:08:39.736 --> 00:08:45.346
in it is selected and there
it is and now, I'll just wait

214
00:08:45.346 --> 00:08:47.436
for stocks to be
highlighted and press again.

215
00:08:47.486 --> 00:08:49.466
And again, you can see
this context menu pops

216
00:08:49.466 --> 00:08:52.456
up with anything I might
be interested in, you know,

217
00:08:52.456 --> 00:08:54.636
for this element, anything
this element responds to.

218
00:08:54.936 --> 00:08:57.506
And so, I'm going to wait
until touch is selected

219
00:09:01.426 --> 00:09:03.456
and maybe I want to see
the graph associated

220
00:09:03.456 --> 00:09:04.846
with Apple stock.

221
00:09:07.826 --> 00:09:10.786
And so again, I'm going to
walk down to the Apple stock

222
00:09:12.406 --> 00:09:13.826
and use touch to drill in.

223
00:09:13.926 --> 00:09:16.336
I can see how you get the
graph related to Apple stock.

224
00:09:16.666 --> 00:09:19.296
And so again, this is a
really powerful feature

225
00:09:19.296 --> 00:09:21.846
and we think it's going to open
up iOS to a whole new group

226
00:09:21.846 --> 00:09:23.946
of users and we're really
excited to get it in your hands

227
00:09:24.146 --> 00:09:25.446
and to get feedback from you.

228
00:09:27.026 --> 00:09:28.016
And so, that's Switch control.

229
00:09:30.036 --> 00:09:32.356
OK. So as I said before,
the rest of today,

230
00:09:32.356 --> 00:09:34.256
we're really just going to
dive in and do some development

231
00:09:34.256 --> 00:09:35.576
and fix some Accessibility
problems.

232
00:09:36.026 --> 00:09:39.056
So before we do that, I want to
give you a brief introduction

233
00:09:39.056 --> 00:09:41.716
to how UIAccessibility
works under the hood to try

234
00:09:41.716 --> 00:09:43.306
and give you a better
understanding of that process.

235
00:09:43.626 --> 00:09:45.916
After that, we're going to
do an Accessibility audit

236
00:09:45.916 --> 00:09:48.046
of the application I brought
today and this will allow us

237
00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:50.956
to quickly find any
Accessibility issues we have

238
00:09:50.956 --> 00:09:53.436
in our application so we
can kind of get a game plan

239
00:09:53.436 --> 00:09:54.446
of how we're going to fix them.

240
00:09:55.306 --> 00:09:57.326
And then once we've
identified these bugs,

241
00:09:57.626 --> 00:10:00.206
we're going to use the
UIAccessibility API

242
00:09:57.626 --> 00:10:00.206
we're going to use the
UIAccessibility API

243
00:10:00.676 --> 00:10:03.116
to fix them again, you know,
starting with the most basic

244
00:10:03.116 --> 00:10:05.416
and we'll see how far we can
get just using those basic

245
00:10:05.416 --> 00:10:06.466
Accessibility attributes.

246
00:10:06.776 --> 00:10:09.296
And then we'll work up to
some more advanced problems,

247
00:10:09.296 --> 00:10:11.126
use a little bit
of advanced API.

248
00:10:11.756 --> 00:10:13.486
And again, the brand
new API is going

249
00:10:13.486 --> 00:10:15.966
to let us do some some cool
stuff that we're excited to see

250
00:10:15.966 --> 00:10:17.686
where you guys take that
and then we'll finish

251
00:10:17.686 --> 00:10:21.046
up by looking at Guided Access.

252
00:10:21.236 --> 00:10:23.176
So, how does UIAccessibility
work?

253
00:10:23.176 --> 00:10:26.176
The easiest way to
explain this is to look

254
00:10:26.176 --> 00:10:28.156
at an Accessibility
feature in action.

255
00:10:28.596 --> 00:10:31.446
So here, you can see
VoiceOver is on the far left,

256
00:10:31.516 --> 00:10:33.366
the Calculator application
is on the far right,

257
00:10:33.646 --> 00:10:36.726
and we see UIAccessibility
in the center tied

258
00:10:36.726 --> 00:10:39.186
to the UIKit stack as it is.

259
00:10:39.186 --> 00:10:41.626
And so, as I said before,
when VoiceOver is on,

260
00:10:41.626 --> 00:10:43.896
it is intercepting
all of the touch

261
00:10:43.896 --> 00:10:45.286
and Multi-Touch gestures
on the screen.

262
00:10:45.576 --> 00:10:47.346
And what it's doing when
it intercepts those is it's

263
00:10:47.556 --> 00:10:49.136
transforming them into questions

264
00:10:49.136 --> 00:10:52.586
that it can ask your application
using UIAccessibility.

265
00:10:53.106 --> 00:10:55.796
And so, if a user were to
touch on a Calculator app say

266
00:10:55.796 --> 00:11:01.076
in the center of the screen,
VoiceOver then internally,

267
00:10:55.796 --> 00:11:01.076
in the center of the screen,
VoiceOver then internally,

268
00:11:01.076 --> 00:11:02.296
you know, computes
this question,

269
00:11:02.296 --> 00:11:03.876
what is the element
at this point?

270
00:11:04.256 --> 00:11:06.716
And so, VoiceOver goes over
through UIAccessibility

271
00:11:06.716 --> 00:11:07.656
to answer this question.

272
00:11:07.936 --> 00:11:11.046
And if your application has
correctly implemented, you know,

273
00:11:11.046 --> 00:11:13.526
the appropriate UIAccessibility
methods,

274
00:11:14.086 --> 00:11:17.286
VoiceOver can then pull things
like the accessibilityLabel

275
00:11:17.286 --> 00:11:20.266
and the accessibilityFrame right
from your application and back

276
00:11:20.266 --> 00:11:21.656
over through UIAccessibility.

277
00:11:21.916 --> 00:11:25.706
And so once VoiceOver has this
information, it can transform it

278
00:11:25.706 --> 00:11:27.416
into output that's
appropriate for the user

279
00:11:27.676 --> 00:11:31.506
so that output may be
speech or possibly Braille.

280
00:11:33.536 --> 00:11:36.106
Great. So now, we have
kind of a general idea

281
00:11:36.106 --> 00:11:39.466
of how Accessibility features
will query our application.

282
00:11:40.766 --> 00:11:44.186
So, how can we make sure our
application correctly responds

283
00:11:44.186 --> 00:11:44.756
to these queries?

284
00:11:44.756 --> 00:11:46.256
How can we make sure
we are playing well

285
00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:47.776
with these Accessibility
features?

286
00:11:48.556 --> 00:11:51.376
Well, as I said before, really,
the easiest way to do this is

287
00:11:51.376 --> 00:11:53.676
to do an Accessibility
audit of our application.

288
00:11:54.186 --> 00:11:56.176
And so, if you're working in
a simulator, we have a tool

289
00:11:56.176 --> 00:11:58.216
for you called the
Accessibility Inspector.

290
00:11:58.666 --> 00:12:00.236
But even better, if
you're on the device,

291
00:11:58.666 --> 00:12:00.236
But even better, if
you're on the device,

292
00:12:00.236 --> 00:12:01.766
we can just use the
Accessibility features

293
00:12:01.766 --> 00:12:03.116
themselves and this
is really going

294
00:12:03.116 --> 00:12:04.396
to give us a great understanding

295
00:12:04.606 --> 00:12:06.316
of how our app works
with Accessibility.

296
00:12:06.676 --> 00:12:08.176
Both of these features
can be found

297
00:12:08.176 --> 00:12:09.176
in the Settings application

298
00:12:09.496 --> 00:12:12.576
under General Accessibility
as we saw before.

299
00:12:13.586 --> 00:12:16.936
And it's worth noting that we
also have a great extra feature

300
00:12:16.936 --> 00:12:18.246
called the Accessibility
Shortcut,

301
00:12:18.526 --> 00:12:22.186
some of you may know it as its
former name, just triple-click.

302
00:12:22.546 --> 00:12:26.146
Accessibility Shortcut lets you
tie an Accessibility feature

303
00:12:26.256 --> 00:12:29.536
or more than one feature to
three clicks of the Home button.

304
00:12:29.756 --> 00:12:32.066
And so, this lets you quickly
click the Home button three

305
00:12:32.066 --> 00:12:34.116
times, turn something
like VoiceOver on,

306
00:12:34.116 --> 00:12:35.916
do an audit of your application,

307
00:12:35.996 --> 00:12:38.536
click the Home button three
times to turn VoiceOver off.

308
00:12:38.586 --> 00:12:40.336
So, it's really handy
for this audit process.

309
00:12:41.236 --> 00:12:42.466
And so now, let's dive in

310
00:12:42.466 --> 00:12:44.516
and find our accessibility
bugs today,

311
00:12:44.516 --> 00:12:46.036
let's see what we
have to deal with.

312
00:12:46.386 --> 00:12:49.336
Okay, as we said, we're going to
open the Settings application,

313
00:12:50.266 --> 00:12:52.416
General Accessibility,
same as last time.

314
00:12:52.496 --> 00:12:54.396
I'm going to scroll all
the way to the bottom

315
00:12:54.486 --> 00:12:56.216
and I see the Accessibility
Shortcut.

316
00:12:57.156 --> 00:12:58.926
So again, I'm going
to pair VoiceOver

317
00:12:59.026 --> 00:13:00.256
with my Accessibility Shortcut

318
00:12:59.026 --> 00:13:00.256
with my Accessibility Shortcut

319
00:13:00.656 --> 00:13:02.416
and I really recommend
you use VoiceOver.

320
00:13:02.416 --> 00:13:04.426
I mean, you know, you
can use Switch Control

321
00:13:04.426 --> 00:13:06.866
if you're feeling courageous.

322
00:13:06.866 --> 00:13:10.166
But VoiceOver has the
easiest learning curve

323
00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:13.106
and it's really a, you can turn
it on, and just hear what's

324
00:13:13.106 --> 00:13:14.886
under your finger,
navigate around.

325
00:13:14.886 --> 00:13:16.096
It's really a quick and easy way

326
00:13:16.096 --> 00:13:17.696
to do a great accessibility
audit.

327
00:13:18.006 --> 00:13:19.376
And so now, if I
click three times--

328
00:13:21.806 --> 00:13:23.326
>> VoiceOver on, settings.

329
00:13:23.846 --> 00:13:25.646
>> VoiceOver comes on
and it reads what's

330
00:13:25.646 --> 00:13:26.906
under the cursor as expected.

331
00:13:27.096 --> 00:13:28.256
And if I click three
times again-- -

332
00:13:28.256 --> 00:13:28.796
>> VoiceOver off.

333
00:13:29.126 --> 00:13:31.456
>> VoiceOver turns off
so it's really easy.

334
00:13:33.176 --> 00:13:34.496
And so now, let's
open our application

335
00:13:34.496 --> 00:13:35.426
and see what we're
working on today.

336
00:13:36.256 --> 00:13:37.736
So the application we're going

337
00:13:37.736 --> 00:13:40.886
to be making accessible
today is a floor--

338
00:13:40.886 --> 00:13:42.756
a series of floor plans
of the convention center.

339
00:13:42.996 --> 00:13:45.546
And so, let's exam it before
we turn accessibility on

340
00:13:45.546 --> 00:13:46.456
and see what-- and, you know,

341
00:13:46.656 --> 00:13:48.106
see what we're going
to have to fix.

342
00:13:48.186 --> 00:13:51.246
So if we look across
the top, we have a label

343
00:13:51.246 --> 00:13:53.706
of the convention center and
it looks like an indicator

344
00:13:53.706 --> 00:13:54.936
of what floor we're looking at.

345
00:13:55.306 --> 00:13:58.796
On the left hand side, I
see an Elevator control

346
00:13:59.026 --> 00:14:01.616
that as expected,
let us increment

347
00:13:59.026 --> 00:14:01.616
that as expected,
let us increment

348
00:14:01.616 --> 00:14:02.856
or decrement the
floor we're seeing.

349
00:14:03.196 --> 00:14:06.626
And at the very bottom,
a control called Coffee

350
00:14:06.626 --> 00:14:08.306
and if I swipe it, it
shows us, you know,

351
00:14:08.306 --> 00:14:10.296
where you can find Coffee in
the convention center right now.

352
00:14:10.526 --> 00:14:12.276
And so, if we triple click
to turn VoiceOver on-- -

353
00:14:12.336 --> 00:14:13.566
>> VoiceOver on.

354
00:14:13.566 --> 00:14:14.066
Landscape.

355
00:14:14.836 --> 00:14:14.966
>> Great.

356
00:14:15.366 --> 00:14:17.426
>> Home button to the
left, top and center.

357
00:14:18.216 --> 00:14:20.736
>> So it comes on as
expected and it lands

358
00:14:20.736 --> 00:14:23.596
on the first thing it finds and
in this case, it finds a label

359
00:14:23.596 --> 00:14:24.446
at the top of the screen

360
00:14:24.976 --> 00:14:27.586
and that label is already
accessible so that's great.

361
00:14:27.846 --> 00:14:30.736
Let's try and touch the floor
value next to the label.

362
00:14:31.306 --> 00:14:32.996
So, it looks like I'm
not getting anything

363
00:14:32.996 --> 00:14:35.966
when I touch the floor
number next to the--

364
00:14:35.966 --> 00:14:36.906
or next to the heading,

365
00:14:36.906 --> 00:14:39.006
I'm going to try touching the
control on the left hand side.

366
00:14:40.446 --> 00:14:42.516
Again, I don't see anything
VoiceOver doesn't know anything

367
00:14:42.516 --> 00:14:47.376
is there, the control at the
bottom, nothing and as expected,

368
00:14:47.376 --> 00:14:49.936
the map in the center,
again, not accessible at all.

369
00:14:49.936 --> 00:14:51.926
So, it looks like we've got
our work cut out for us.

370
00:14:51.926 --> 00:14:53.046
This is going to be, you know,

371
00:14:53.046 --> 00:14:55.146
you think this might be a
tough job but you're going

372
00:14:55.146 --> 00:14:56.816
to be amazed that
just in a few minutes,

373
00:14:56.816 --> 00:14:58.786
we're going to take this
completely inaccessible

374
00:14:58.786 --> 00:15:01.036
application and make a great
accessibility experience.

375
00:14:58.786 --> 00:15:01.036
application and make a great
accessibility experience.

376
00:15:05.596 --> 00:15:09.796
Okay, so we have an idea of the
bugs we need to start tackling,

377
00:15:10.116 --> 00:15:11.616
you know, how are we
going to fix these bugs,

378
00:15:11.616 --> 00:15:12.606
what API are we going to use?

379
00:15:12.936 --> 00:15:15.456
So as I said, we're going to
start with the basic API first

380
00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:17.446
and work our way up, pick off
the low hanging fruit, take,

381
00:15:17.446 --> 00:15:18.986
you know, take off--
take down the easy bugs.

382
00:15:18.986 --> 00:15:22.146
So, the two most important
accessibility attributes we're

383
00:15:22.146 --> 00:15:24.656
going to be working with
are isAccessibilityElement

384
00:15:24.656 --> 00:15:25.966
and accessibilityLabel.

385
00:15:26.886 --> 00:15:29.636
So, for isAccessibilityElement,
you want to return yes

386
00:15:29.876 --> 00:15:32.656
for any element that you
want VoiceOver to see.

387
00:15:32.926 --> 00:15:34.346
When we were using
our application,

388
00:15:34.346 --> 00:15:36.216
we saw that VoiceOver
wasn't even aware of most

389
00:15:36.216 --> 00:15:37.126
of the elements on screen.

390
00:15:37.396 --> 00:15:40.256
And so to fix this, this would
be the appropriate piece of API.

391
00:15:40.866 --> 00:15:43.476
And it's worth noting that if
you're using standard UIKit

392
00:15:43.476 --> 00:15:47.426
controls or labels like
UILabel, this is on by default,

393
00:15:47.426 --> 00:15:48.796
VoiceOver knows about
these by default.

394
00:15:48.796 --> 00:15:50.696
You really get a lot of
accessibility for free

395
00:15:50.696 --> 00:15:52.036
when you use the
built-in classes.

396
00:15:53.286 --> 00:15:55.486
And second, as I said
is accessibilityLabel.

397
00:15:55.836 --> 00:15:58.856
Here, we want to return
a textual representation

398
00:15:59.226 --> 00:16:01.396
of the element and in
the case of VoiceOver,

399
00:15:59.226 --> 00:16:01.396
of the element and in
the case of VoiceOver,

400
00:16:01.396 --> 00:16:02.826
this is the first thing
VoiceOver is going

401
00:16:02.826 --> 00:16:03.676
to speak to the user.

402
00:16:04.206 --> 00:16:08.576
And the last three pieces of
easy API we're going to need

403
00:16:08.576 --> 00:16:11.466
to use are accessibilityHint,
accessibilityValue,

404
00:16:11.466 --> 00:16:12.646
and accessibilityTraits.

405
00:16:13.046 --> 00:16:15.546
So, for accessibilityHint,
we're going to want

406
00:16:15.546 --> 00:16:17.646
to provide some additional
usage information

407
00:16:17.966 --> 00:16:20.086
to the accessibility
features like VoiceOver.

408
00:16:20.276 --> 00:16:22.286
And we're going to want
to do this in cases

409
00:16:22.286 --> 00:16:27.256
where maybe the implications of
using this control or element

410
00:16:27.256 --> 00:16:28.876
as it were are non obvious.

411
00:16:28.926 --> 00:16:31.016
So in the case of our Coffee
control if we think back,

412
00:16:31.436 --> 00:16:33.496
you know, when you use
the Coffee control,

413
00:16:33.656 --> 00:16:35.206
it changes something
somewhere else.

414
00:16:35.436 --> 00:16:37.006
So this would be a great
place to add a hint

415
00:16:37.046 --> 00:16:38.596
to let the user know, you
know, what's happening.

416
00:16:38.796 --> 00:16:41.456
Coffee is, you know, the--
activating the switch will show

417
00:16:41.456 --> 00:16:42.886
or hide Coffee in a
different location.

418
00:16:43.496 --> 00:16:46.846
We also have accessibilityValue
so the--

419
00:16:46.846 --> 00:16:48.986
usually, an elements
label is quite static

420
00:16:49.326 --> 00:16:51.466
but a value is meant
to be changed.

421
00:16:51.466 --> 00:16:54.346
So, if we think back to
the header across the top

422
00:16:54.346 --> 00:16:57.266
of the application, we
remember we had a static label

423
00:16:57.266 --> 00:17:00.566
that said Moscone West but
we also had a floor value.

424
00:16:57.266 --> 00:17:00.566
that said Moscone West but
we also had a floor value.

425
00:17:00.766 --> 00:17:03.486
And so again, this is a great
place to use accessibilityValue.

426
00:17:03.486 --> 00:17:04.726
That floor can change

427
00:17:04.776 --> 00:17:07.306
as we adjust the elevator
control up or down.

428
00:17:07.306 --> 00:17:09.175
We can view a different
floor and we always want

429
00:17:09.175 --> 00:17:11.506
to make sure we're returning the
correct information to VoiceOver

430
00:17:11.736 --> 00:17:13.415
because it's going to call
into these APIs a lot.

431
00:17:14.606 --> 00:17:15.675
And so, the very last piece

432
00:17:15.675 --> 00:17:18.356
of basic API we need
is accessibilityTraits.

433
00:17:18.715 --> 00:17:22.116
So accessibilityTraits are a
bit mask of unsigned integers

434
00:17:22.116 --> 00:17:25.675
that you can or together to
really convey the behavior

435
00:17:25.675 --> 00:17:27.566
and intended use
of that element.

436
00:17:28.046 --> 00:17:31.636
And so, traits are a little
tricky, you know, a little hard

437
00:17:31.636 --> 00:17:33.366
to wrap your head around
if this is your first time.

438
00:17:33.606 --> 00:17:36.406
So, let's take a look at an
application that's already

439
00:17:36.406 --> 00:17:37.986
in iOS and see how the
traits are applied.

440
00:17:39.286 --> 00:17:41.966
Well first, we see this
header across the top

441
00:17:41.966 --> 00:17:44.296
of the application, you know,
it really contains the city

442
00:17:44.426 --> 00:17:47.246
and the temperature of that
city and this really conveys,

443
00:17:47.246 --> 00:17:50.086
you know, the most information
for this application.

444
00:17:50.366 --> 00:17:51.696
And so here, it would
be appropriate

445
00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:52.756
to use the header trait.

446
00:17:53.946 --> 00:17:56.636
Similarly further down, we
some static text, you know,

447
00:17:56.636 --> 00:17:58.046
these days of the
week do not change,

448
00:17:58.306 --> 00:18:00.806
so the static text trait
would be appropriate here

449
00:17:58.306 --> 00:18:00.806
so the static text trait
would be appropriate here

450
00:18:00.946 --> 00:18:02.376
and it would give
VoiceOver an indication

451
00:18:02.376 --> 00:18:03.266
of how to speak this item.

452
00:18:04.316 --> 00:18:06.506
Further down, we see
a Standard button

453
00:18:06.506 --> 00:18:08.556
and the button trait
will be appropriate here

454
00:18:08.556 --> 00:18:12.806
and it's worth noting that since
this is, you know, built on top

455
00:18:12.806 --> 00:18:15.356
of a standard UIButton,
a UIKit class,

456
00:18:15.716 --> 00:18:18.196
it already has this
UIAccessibility trait of button,

457
00:18:18.196 --> 00:18:19.196
we don't actually
need to add it.

458
00:18:19.466 --> 00:18:21.746
And again, this is the case for
a lot of these built-in classes,

459
00:18:21.996 --> 00:18:24.396
you know, they have the
isAccessibilityElement yes,

460
00:18:24.426 --> 00:18:25.476
they're visible to VoiceOver,

461
00:18:25.476 --> 00:18:26.726
they have the appropriate
traits.

462
00:18:26.726 --> 00:18:29.096
If you've assigned a
name to your button,

463
00:18:29.096 --> 00:18:31.426
if you're just using a
standard round rect button,

464
00:18:31.666 --> 00:18:33.176
VoiceOver will use
that as the label.

465
00:18:33.176 --> 00:18:34.306
So, VoiceOver is
very intelligent

466
00:18:34.306 --> 00:18:35.416
about these standard classes.

467
00:18:35.686 --> 00:18:37.766
So, it's a good way to
get the most accessibility

468
00:18:37.766 --> 00:18:38.966
for your buck.

469
00:18:40.036 --> 00:18:43.106
And then lastly, we have this
page control across the bottom

470
00:18:43.106 --> 00:18:48.076
and again, by default, this page
control is an adjustable item.

471
00:18:48.336 --> 00:18:51.766
And if you are rolling
one yourself, you know,

472
00:18:51.766 --> 00:18:54.386
a selector type control,
here is where you'd want

473
00:18:54.386 --> 00:18:56.456
to use adjustable and this
really will lend itself well

474
00:18:56.456 --> 00:18:58.396
to that elevator control we
saw on the left hand side

475
00:18:58.396 --> 00:19:00.706
of the screen because it is
basically just an increment

476
00:18:58.396 --> 00:19:00.706
of the screen because it is
basically just an increment

477
00:19:00.706 --> 00:19:02.476
or decrement or up and down
the change of the floor.

478
00:19:04.596 --> 00:19:07.356
Great. So now, we know what
pieces of API we need to use

479
00:19:07.556 --> 00:19:10.096
to get us most of the way
there, how do we use them?

480
00:19:11.146 --> 00:19:13.936
Well, if your interface is
quite static and you are working

481
00:19:13.936 --> 00:19:16.246
in Interface Builder, the good
news is you can handle most

482
00:19:16.246 --> 00:19:16.986
of it right there.

483
00:19:17.756 --> 00:19:19.996
So, we have an Accessibility
enabled check box

484
00:19:20.046 --> 00:19:22.116
that corresponds to
isAccessibilityElement.

485
00:19:23.136 --> 00:19:27.786
Similarly, we have a
text field that is--

486
00:19:27.786 --> 00:19:30.086
that corresponds to
accessibilityLabel.

487
00:19:30.446 --> 00:19:33.876
A text field that corresponds
to accessibilityHint

488
00:19:35.006 --> 00:19:37.526
and then you see a series
of check boxes below

489
00:19:37.696 --> 00:19:39.146
that correspond to
accessibilityTraits

490
00:19:39.436 --> 00:19:41.376
and you're going to want
to select all the traits

491
00:19:41.636 --> 00:19:43.696
and they are, you know,
under the hood or together

492
00:19:43.886 --> 00:19:47.196
to really convey the behavior
and usage of this element

493
00:19:47.196 --> 00:19:49.176
to VoiceOver or any
Accessibility feature.

494
00:19:49.746 --> 00:19:52.296
So, what if you're
working in code?

495
00:19:52.546 --> 00:19:54.416
Well again, if your
interface is quite static,

496
00:19:54.626 --> 00:19:57.526
we can set these attributes,
we don't have to override them.

497
00:19:57.746 --> 00:20:00.426
And so, you know, we find
an appropriate place to do

498
00:19:57.746 --> 00:20:00.426
And so, you know, we find
an appropriate place to do

499
00:20:00.426 --> 00:20:03.726
that like awakeFromNib
our header is created

500
00:20:03.826 --> 00:20:06.956
and then we're going to set the
isAccessibilityElement value

501
00:20:06.956 --> 00:20:07.466
to yes.

502
00:20:07.646 --> 00:20:09.526
We're going to set
our accessibilityLabel

503
00:20:09.726 --> 00:20:10.606
to something appropriate.

504
00:20:10.606 --> 00:20:12.846
And then, we're going to
set our accessibilityTraits

505
00:20:12.846 --> 00:20:13.706
to something appropriate.

506
00:20:13.706 --> 00:20:15.446
And again, in this case
maybe the header trait was

507
00:20:15.446 --> 00:20:16.096
most appropriate.

508
00:20:16.626 --> 00:20:20.496
But your interface isn't
always static, right?

509
00:20:20.496 --> 00:20:22.576
I mean our interface that we're
working on today is not static

510
00:20:22.576 --> 00:20:24.286
so what do you do in
these dynamic cases?

511
00:20:24.446 --> 00:20:25.416
Well, here is where
you're going to want

512
00:20:25.416 --> 00:20:26.736
to override these methods

513
00:20:26.996 --> 00:20:30.266
and make sure you're always
returning the appropriate value

514
00:20:30.266 --> 00:20:31.236
at the appropriate time.

515
00:20:31.536 --> 00:20:34.086
And so here, we've
overridden accessibilityValue

516
00:20:34.246 --> 00:20:37.086
and we're always returning
the actual floor number

517
00:20:37.086 --> 00:20:37.716
that we're on.

518
00:20:37.996 --> 00:20:39.746
And so again, we're going
to use accessibilityValue

519
00:20:39.746 --> 00:20:42.006
in our application for
exactly this purpose.

520
00:20:43.706 --> 00:20:45.456
Great. So now that
we have an idea

521
00:20:45.456 --> 00:20:47.576
of the basic API we're
going to use, let's go ahead

522
00:20:47.576 --> 00:20:49.486
and see how well
we can do with just

523
00:20:49.486 --> 00:20:51.596
that in our application, OK?

524
00:20:51.596 --> 00:20:54.316
So, let's start by taking
a look at this, you know,

525
00:20:54.826 --> 00:20:57.216
header information across
the top of the application.

526
00:20:58.086 --> 00:21:02.476
So, if I find the class, I
know that is my titleView,

527
00:20:58.086 --> 00:21:02.476
So, if I find the class, I
know that is my titleView,

528
00:21:03.156 --> 00:21:08.296
I'm going to go ahead and just
grab the basic accessibility

529
00:21:08.296 --> 00:21:12.326
attribute stubs and drop them in
and just go right down the list.

530
00:21:14.556 --> 00:21:16.386
So first, we want
VoiceOver to see this element

531
00:21:16.386 --> 00:21:19.526
so isAccessibilityElement
YES is absolutely necessary.

532
00:21:22.086 --> 00:21:25.306
Secondly, we need a label
for this element and we saw

533
00:21:25.306 --> 00:21:29.786
that because we have a
standard UILabel as a sub view

534
00:21:29.786 --> 00:21:32.306
of this view, you know,
it was already accessible,

535
00:21:32.306 --> 00:21:34.696
it already had-- it lends
itself well to accessibility.

536
00:21:34.986 --> 00:21:38.476
So, what we're trying to do
here is combine the floor

537
00:21:38.696 --> 00:21:41.306
and the label together because
they really only make sense

538
00:21:41.366 --> 00:21:43.776
together out of context if
you just heard, you know,

539
00:21:43.846 --> 00:21:45.116
two out in the middle
of nowhere,

540
00:21:45.116 --> 00:21:45.986
it really makes no sense.

541
00:21:46.356 --> 00:21:48.146
And so again, we're
combining this information,

542
00:21:48.146 --> 00:21:49.486
we're combining these
sub views together.

543
00:21:49.486 --> 00:21:52.756
And so, we're going to do that
by simply returning the value

544
00:21:52.756 --> 00:21:56.586
that title label was
already giving us,

545
00:21:56.646 --> 00:22:01.376
titleLabel, text, great.

546
00:21:56.646 --> 00:22:01.376
titleLabel, text, great.

547
00:22:02.036 --> 00:22:05.586
So, this is a pretty
obvious element,

548
00:22:05.586 --> 00:22:07.526
accessibilityHint is not
really necessary here

549
00:22:08.746 --> 00:22:11.066
but we do have a use for value.

550
00:22:11.596 --> 00:22:13.756
And for value, if I
jump to the header,

551
00:22:13.956 --> 00:22:17.676
I can see that this element,
you know, has a representation

552
00:22:17.676 --> 00:22:18.836
of the floor internally.

553
00:22:19.466 --> 00:22:21.206
And so this is a great
place to use that.

554
00:22:21.706 --> 00:22:27.956
[ Pause ]

555
00:22:28.456 --> 00:22:29.776
Okay.

556
00:22:30.276 --> 00:22:40.656
[ Pause ]

557
00:22:41.156 --> 00:22:43.126
And I'll leave traits
out of this one.

558
00:22:43.406 --> 00:22:46.126
It's worth mention that
Accessibility is just

559
00:22:46.126 --> 00:22:48.006
like application
design in general.

560
00:22:48.336 --> 00:22:50.856
You know, there is often
no exact right answer,

561
00:22:50.856 --> 00:22:52.426
just like you're
designing your interface

562
00:22:52.426 --> 00:22:54.106
to convey what you want
to convey to the user,

563
00:22:54.346 --> 00:22:55.756
you do that with
Accessibility as well.

564
00:22:55.756 --> 00:22:57.536
And so, you know, you need

565
00:22:57.536 --> 00:22:59.146
to make these choices
as you progress.

566
00:23:01.036 --> 00:23:03.186
And I should also make note,
you know, we always want

567
00:23:03.186 --> 00:23:06.016
to localize our labels
and use number formatters

568
00:23:06.016 --> 00:23:06.626
as appropriate.

569
00:23:06.626 --> 00:23:10.016
VoiceOver works in a huge number
of languages but for brevity,

570
00:23:10.426 --> 00:23:14.906
we'll leave that out today.

571
00:23:15.096 --> 00:23:17.086
So next, let's take a look
at this Coffee control

572
00:23:17.206 --> 00:23:18.316
on the bottom of the screen.

573
00:23:18.866 --> 00:23:23.306
We're going to start
the same way as before.

574
00:23:25.016 --> 00:23:28.526
The first thing to do is make
sure Accessibility can see

575
00:23:28.526 --> 00:23:29.156
this control.

576
00:23:31.146 --> 00:23:34.136
Again, we need to return a label
for this, something appropriate

577
00:23:35.096 --> 00:23:37.076
and go ahead and call it Coffee.

578
00:23:37.676 --> 00:23:40.956
And as we said before,
you know, the implications

579
00:23:40.956 --> 00:23:44.956
of activating this switch might
not be obvious to all users

580
00:23:45.216 --> 00:23:49.466
so let's go ahead and return
a hint here, maybe something

581
00:23:49.466 --> 00:23:54.726
like show or hide
Coffee locations.

582
00:23:59.726 --> 00:24:00.626
So, what should our value be?

583
00:23:59.726 --> 00:24:00.626
So, what should our value be?

584
00:24:00.626 --> 00:24:02.866
Well, we do have a value
associated with this control,

585
00:24:02.866 --> 00:24:04.336
right, and that value
is off or on.

586
00:24:05.426 --> 00:24:09.256
And so here, if I jump
to my header again,

587
00:24:09.306 --> 00:24:11.826
I see that it does have
a state of off or on

588
00:24:12.286 --> 00:24:14.776
and so I'll just go
ahead and use that state.

589
00:24:15.566 --> 00:24:20.106
And if it's on, let's return
a string that says on.

590
00:24:20.636 --> 00:24:22.046
And similarly, if it's off,

591
00:24:22.736 --> 00:24:24.336
let's just go ahead
and return off.

592
00:24:24.876 --> 00:24:29.716
And lastly, traits, what
should the traits be for this.

593
00:24:30.356 --> 00:24:33.996
Well, I'm thinking that the
most appropriate trait here

594
00:24:34.276 --> 00:24:35.026
is button.

595
00:24:35.086 --> 00:24:37.466
This really is a
stateful button.

596
00:24:37.716 --> 00:24:39.546
If you, you know, press it,
you can get it to go on,

597
00:24:39.546 --> 00:24:41.016
if you press it again,
you can get it to go off.

598
00:24:41.896 --> 00:24:43.566
And so, we'll see
how button works.

599
00:24:44.066 --> 00:24:49.716
Let's see lastly, let's take a
look at this Elevator control

600
00:24:50.016 --> 00:24:52.696
on the left hand side of the
screen for our, you know,

601
00:24:52.696 --> 00:24:53.916
to see how to use our basic API.

602
00:24:54.786 --> 00:24:57.196
And so, let's find
it, Elevator control.

603
00:24:58.556 --> 00:24:59.606
We'll drop in our stubs.

604
00:25:02.816 --> 00:25:05.216
Again, let's make it
visible to Accessibility,

605
00:25:05.216 --> 00:25:06.906
that's our first step.

606
00:25:08.746 --> 00:25:12.076
We need an appropriate label
for Accessibility features

607
00:25:12.076 --> 00:25:13.926
to speak or use as they need.

608
00:25:14.396 --> 00:25:18.106
And here, let's do Floor.

609
00:25:19.686 --> 00:25:23.436
It, you know, there's really no
need for a hint in this case.

610
00:25:23.586 --> 00:25:24.656
Again, it's pretty obvious.

611
00:25:28.656 --> 00:25:31.386
The same as before, we're
going to need to convey

612
00:25:31.386 --> 00:25:33.916
that floor value and if
we flip to our header,

613
00:25:33.916 --> 00:25:35.716
we see that this control too has

614
00:25:36.066 --> 00:25:38.926
or this element too has a
floor value associated with it.

615
00:25:40.986 --> 00:25:50.316
So, let's go ahead
and return the-- oops.

616
00:25:50.836 --> 00:25:54.936
And lastly, traits,
what traits do we want?

617
00:25:55.146 --> 00:25:57.496
Well, as I said before,
this is really an

618
00:25:57.496 --> 00:26:00.296
incrementor/decrementor and
so, this is one of those times

619
00:25:57.496 --> 00:26:00.296
incrementor/decrementor and
so, this is one of those times

620
00:26:00.296 --> 00:26:02.086
when you as the implementer,
you know,

621
00:26:02.086 --> 00:26:03.586
have to make these
decisions yourself just

622
00:26:03.586 --> 00:26:05.066
like you're designing
your application.

623
00:26:05.066 --> 00:26:07.236
We're going to have to make
some Accessibility choices.

624
00:26:07.486 --> 00:26:09.946
So, we could make the
top button, you know,

625
00:26:10.176 --> 00:26:11.636
an increment button
and the bottom button a

626
00:26:11.636 --> 00:26:12.276
decrement button.

627
00:26:12.606 --> 00:26:14.806
But again, I've decided that, I
think, it would be most useful

628
00:26:14.976 --> 00:26:16.536
if we just made this
an adjustable control

629
00:26:16.786 --> 00:26:19.486
that you could easily
flip up and down.

630
00:26:20.076 --> 00:26:25.806
And so, let's go ahead do
that, I'll try adjustable.

631
00:26:26.386 --> 00:26:36.726
Great. And so now, let's
go ahead and push this

632
00:26:37.746 --> 00:26:39.046
to our device and see how we did

633
00:26:39.046 --> 00:26:44.306
with just a little
bit of accessibility.

634
00:26:44.366 --> 00:26:44.716
>> WWDC maps.

635
00:26:45.976 --> 00:26:47.496
Double tap to open, VoiceOver.

636
00:26:47.496 --> 00:26:52.896
>> VoiceOver is a
little jumpy, anxious.

637
00:26:53.396 --> 00:26:59.226
[ Pause ]

638
00:26:59.726 --> 00:27:01.956
Okay, so if we switch back
over to our application,

639
00:26:59.726 --> 00:27:01.956
Okay, so if we switch back
over to our application,

640
00:27:02.176 --> 00:27:03.346
let's turn VoiceOver back on.

641
00:27:03.796 --> 00:27:05.356
>> VoiceOver on, landscape.

642
00:27:06.526 --> 00:27:09.946
Home button to the left,
Moscone West, floor two.

643
00:27:10.416 --> 00:27:12.516
>> Great. So if we check
the title or the header

644
00:27:12.516 --> 00:27:13.456
across the top of the screen.

645
00:27:13.706 --> 00:27:17.096
We see that, we've now mashed
all of that information together

646
00:27:17.096 --> 00:27:19.006
into one element and it
really makes sense, you know,

647
00:27:19.276 --> 00:27:22.436
the context and the label are
really all there together.

648
00:27:22.696 --> 00:27:24.246
So let's try the control
on the side of the screen.

649
00:27:24.336 --> 00:27:26.176
>> Floor two, adjustable.

650
00:27:27.376 --> 00:27:29.546
Swipe up or down with one
finger to adjust the value.

651
00:27:30.496 --> 00:27:32.566
>> Great. So VoiceOver can
see this element as well.

652
00:27:32.686 --> 00:27:34.216
And since we've used
the adjustable trait,

653
00:27:34.216 --> 00:27:37.106
it even gives us a hint
on how to use this element

654
00:27:37.216 --> 00:27:38.576
and it's telling you
to swipe up or down

655
00:27:38.576 --> 00:27:39.436
to increment or decrement.

656
00:27:39.436 --> 00:27:40.866
So, I'm going to swipe up.

657
00:27:41.216 --> 00:27:41.956
>> Two.

658
00:27:42.566 --> 00:27:43.796
>> Unfortunately,
we hear the bonk

659
00:27:43.796 --> 00:27:45.216
so there's something
we're missing there.

660
00:27:45.406 --> 00:27:47.706
We're almost there so we'll
have to handle that one again.

661
00:27:47.706 --> 00:27:49.456
And the Coffee control
at the bottom.

662
00:27:49.756 --> 00:27:51.286
>> Coffee, up button.

663
00:27:52.416 --> 00:27:52.636
>> Great.

664
00:27:52.636 --> 00:27:53.906
>> Show or hide Coffee
locations.

665
00:27:54.396 --> 00:27:56.356
>> And we heard the hint which
gave us some more information

666
00:27:56.356 --> 00:27:59.636
about what this control actually
does, you heard it speak button

667
00:27:59.636 --> 00:28:01.466
because we applied the
button trait to this control.

668
00:27:59.636 --> 00:28:01.466
because we applied the
button trait to this control.

669
00:28:01.466 --> 00:28:03.046
And so now, let's
go ahead and try

670
00:28:03.046 --> 00:28:04.486
and double tap to activate this.

671
00:28:05.186 --> 00:28:06.146
>> Coffee, off.

672
00:28:07.736 --> 00:28:09.736
>> OK. So we still have
an issue there as well.

673
00:28:10.296 --> 00:28:11.886
You know, VoiceOver is
unable to activate it.

674
00:28:11.886 --> 00:28:14.226
By default, when you double
tap, VoiceOver is going

675
00:28:14.226 --> 00:28:16.336
to send a touch to the
center of that element.

676
00:28:16.336 --> 00:28:19.666
And in this case, since
our control is using swipe,

677
00:28:20.096 --> 00:28:23.576
this touch sent to the center is
not going to do what we want it

678
00:28:23.576 --> 00:28:26.666
to do but we're in
great shape, right?

679
00:28:26.666 --> 00:28:29.306
We fixed a huge amount
of the interface

680
00:28:29.576 --> 00:28:30.806
with just a little bit of work.

681
00:28:31.006 --> 00:28:32.596
So, let's see how we can
get the rest the way there.

682
00:28:38.156 --> 00:28:40.106
Well, the elephant in the
room in this application,

683
00:28:40.396 --> 00:28:43.096
the big hurdle we have left
to get over is that map.

684
00:28:43.536 --> 00:28:46.066
How do we convey this
rich spatial information

685
00:28:46.246 --> 00:28:49.926
out of what is essentially
a custom drawn view.

686
00:28:50.516 --> 00:28:53.036
So, the answer to that is
we use something called the

687
00:28:53.036 --> 00:28:54.856
UIAccessibility container
protocol.

688
00:28:55.206 --> 00:28:57.826
And here, we're going to
create Accessibility elements

689
00:28:58.126 --> 00:29:01.006
that represent everything we
want to convey to the user

690
00:28:58.126 --> 00:29:01.006
that represent everything we
want to convey to the user

691
00:29:01.246 --> 00:29:05.156
and return them using the
UIAccessibility protocol.

692
00:29:06.236 --> 00:29:07.046
And so, the three methods,

693
00:29:07.046 --> 00:29:08.986
we're going to be using are
accessibilityElementCount,

694
00:29:09.266 --> 00:29:12.356
accessibilityElementAtIndex,
and indexOfAccessibilityElement

695
00:29:12.646 --> 00:29:14.976
and you might be thinking
these look like array methods.

696
00:29:15.196 --> 00:29:15.856
Well, that's great.

697
00:29:15.856 --> 00:29:17.586
They line up very
well with an array.

698
00:29:17.936 --> 00:29:20.606
So, what we can do is
create these elements,

699
00:29:20.686 --> 00:29:23.386
put them in an array and I've
called my array rooms here

700
00:29:23.546 --> 00:29:26.336
and I just rely on
those, NSArray methods

701
00:29:26.336 --> 00:29:27.676
to really return
this information

702
00:29:27.676 --> 00:29:28.836
to Accessibility as needed.

703
00:29:29.326 --> 00:29:32.756
And so, let's look at how we
would do that, how do we fill

704
00:29:32.756 --> 00:29:34.446
that array with accessible
elements?

705
00:29:34.586 --> 00:29:37.036
Well, the first thing we need

706
00:29:37.036 --> 00:29:40.146
to do is create an accessibility
element for every room.

707
00:29:40.266 --> 00:29:44.406
And so, this is an example
of us doing it in a loop.

708
00:29:44.686 --> 00:29:47.796
Secondly, accessibility
elements unlike UIView elements.

709
00:29:48.276 --> 00:29:50.156
If, you know, if we're
talking about UIView elements,

710
00:29:50.156 --> 00:29:53.026
they have an accessibleFrame,
an accessibilityFrame rather

711
00:29:53.236 --> 00:29:55.846
by default, and that
accessibilityFrame is just

712
00:29:55.846 --> 00:29:57.746
pulled from the actual
frame of that element.

713
00:29:57.746 --> 00:29:59.536
But we're creating these
elements, you know,

714
00:29:59.536 --> 00:30:01.056
out of thin air so they
don't have a frame,

715
00:29:59.536 --> 00:30:01.056
out of thin air so they
don't have a frame,

716
00:30:01.286 --> 00:30:03.426
so we need to figure out what
we want this frame to be.

717
00:30:04.056 --> 00:30:06.826
And so, I have a helper
method that's, you know,

718
00:30:07.076 --> 00:30:08.656
giving me a Frame for each room

719
00:30:09.036 --> 00:30:14.406
and we have a nice convenience
function in UIAccessibility.h

720
00:30:14.666 --> 00:30:18.376
that lets you convert your
frames from view coordinates

721
00:30:18.376 --> 00:30:20.716
to screen coordinates because
all of the accessibility works

722
00:30:20.716 --> 00:30:21.726
in the screen coordinates.

723
00:30:22.036 --> 00:30:24.126
But the great news is you don't
really have to worry about it,

724
00:30:24.366 --> 00:30:25.846
just use this convenient
function.

725
00:30:26.986 --> 00:30:29.176
And the last thing
we need is a label.

726
00:30:29.726 --> 00:30:32.626
So, we need to, you know,
convey a textual representation

727
00:30:32.746 --> 00:30:34.886
of these accessibility
elements to VoiceOver

728
00:30:34.886 --> 00:30:36.606
or whatever the accessibility
feature is.

729
00:30:37.106 --> 00:30:40.816
Another problem we had
was that Coffee control

730
00:30:40.816 --> 00:30:42.406
across the bottom of
the screen, right?

731
00:30:42.406 --> 00:30:44.556
We double-tapped on
it, nothing happened.

732
00:30:44.556 --> 00:30:48.096
And again, you know, our
hypothesis is that that is

733
00:30:48.096 --> 00:30:50.476
because it was only
activatable by swipe.

734
00:30:50.476 --> 00:30:52.896
We-- in this case, we're
using a UIGestureRecognizer

735
00:30:52.926 --> 00:30:55.006
under the hood and it's
just looking for swipe,

736
00:30:55.006 --> 00:30:56.466
it's not handling touch at all.

737
00:30:56.856 --> 00:30:58.576
And so when you get yourself
into cases like this,

738
00:30:58.866 --> 00:31:01.826
we've added some brand new
API in iOS 7 that's going

739
00:30:58.866 --> 00:31:01.826
we've added some brand new
API in iOS 7 that's going

740
00:31:01.826 --> 00:31:03.886
to allow you to, you know, get
yourself out of this corner.

741
00:31:04.056 --> 00:31:06.676
And the way you can do that is
overriding accessibilityActivate

742
00:31:06.916 --> 00:31:07.756
on any method.

743
00:31:07.986 --> 00:31:09.426
And if you handle Activate,

744
00:31:09.666 --> 00:31:11.866
you simply return yes
after you handled it.

745
00:31:11.866 --> 00:31:16.016
And so here, what we're going
to do is take that default input

746
00:31:16.016 --> 00:31:19.286
from VoiceOver and transform it
into, you know, the equivalent

747
00:31:19.286 --> 00:31:20.976
of a swipe so this
control just works.

748
00:31:21.476 --> 00:31:24.476
And then lastly,
some really cool API

749
00:31:24.476 --> 00:31:26.486
that we've added is
accessibilityPath.

750
00:31:26.886 --> 00:31:31.046
So, in-- historically, VoiceOver
has only worked with, you know,

751
00:31:31.046 --> 00:31:32.356
the cursor has only been a rect.

752
00:31:32.746 --> 00:31:35.066
And the problem with
this is that we're unable

753
00:31:35.066 --> 00:31:37.976
to convey spatial information
to users, you know, if--

754
00:31:37.976 --> 00:31:41.796
you can imagine if this Map used
a rect for every single element,

755
00:31:42.006 --> 00:31:43.166
it wouldn't really help us.

756
00:31:43.166 --> 00:31:45.556
We wouldn't really get any of
that rich spatial information.

757
00:31:45.966 --> 00:31:50.106
But now in iOS 7, we can
override accessibility path

758
00:31:50.156 --> 00:31:52.806
or set accessibility path as
necessary and this is going

759
00:31:52.806 --> 00:31:53.466
to be preferred

760
00:31:53.466 --> 00:31:55.406
over accessibilityFrame
any time it's present.

761
00:31:55.646 --> 00:31:56.606
I mean you can see
what this is--

762
00:31:56.606 --> 00:32:00.066
on the screen, what this
is going to allow us to do.

763
00:31:56.606 --> 00:32:00.066
on the screen, what this
is going to allow us to do.

764
00:32:00.506 --> 00:32:02.766
Great. So, let's now go
back to the application

765
00:32:03.066 --> 00:32:04.826
and implement some of
this more advanced API

766
00:32:04.826 --> 00:32:06.346
and see what we can do.

767
00:32:06.596 --> 00:32:09.966
OK. Again, I'm going to go
ahead and grab my stubs,

768
00:32:10.996 --> 00:32:17.916
I'm going to find my
floorPlanView and drop them in.

769
00:32:19.156 --> 00:32:21.186
As we said, we need
somewhere to cache this.

770
00:32:21.186 --> 00:32:22.946
We don't want to be making these
elements all the time, right?

771
00:32:23.236 --> 00:32:31.156
That would be expensive so let's
create an array to store them in

772
00:32:31.916 --> 00:32:40.966
and I'll call my array,
how about axRooms?

773
00:32:43.286 --> 00:32:47.456
Great. And so now, as we saw
on the slide, we can simply go

774
00:32:47.456 --> 00:32:51.366
through these, use our array,

775
00:32:53.596 --> 00:32:56.776
and fill these in
as appropriate.

776
00:32:58.006 --> 00:33:00.356
So, for
accessibilityElementAtIndex,

777
00:32:58.006 --> 00:33:00.356
So, for
accessibilityElementAtIndex,

778
00:33:00.836 --> 00:33:05.126
we're just going to use the
corresponding method on NSArray.

779
00:33:08.166 --> 00:33:10.676
Similarly for
accessibilityElementCount,

780
00:33:10.816 --> 00:33:12.076
we just go right to the array.

781
00:33:13.426 --> 00:33:18.926
And then as expected lastly,
for indexOfAccessibilityElement,

782
00:33:18.926 --> 00:33:21.266
we can just align that
well with indexOfObject

783
00:33:21.616 --> 00:33:22.566
and pass that element in.

784
00:33:23.796 --> 00:33:26.996
Great. So now, we're returning
these elements as needed

785
00:33:27.256 --> 00:33:28.836
but we still have to
create them, right?

786
00:33:29.006 --> 00:33:32.026
And to do that, let's go ahead

787
00:33:32.026 --> 00:33:35.086
and grab our helper
method and walk through it.

788
00:33:37.046 --> 00:33:39.836
So here, we're lazily
creating an array

789
00:33:39.836 --> 00:33:43.066
to hold these accessibility
rooms and so, this won't happen

790
00:33:43.096 --> 00:33:46.036
until Accessibility asks
us for them, you know,

791
00:33:46.036 --> 00:33:48.236
and at the very last minute
lazily, they will be created.

792
00:33:48.646 --> 00:33:50.526
And then you can see, I
have a helper method here,

793
00:33:50.566 --> 00:33:51.626
floor plan features.

794
00:33:52.206 --> 00:33:54.436
Under the hood, that
is returning to me all

795
00:33:54.436 --> 00:33:56.336
of these paths that
are being drawn

796
00:33:56.336 --> 00:33:57.716
because that's really
what we need.

797
00:33:58.326 --> 00:34:00.836
And so, you might notice that we
are enumerating this backwards

798
00:33:58.326 --> 00:34:00.836
And so, you might notice that we
are enumerating this backwards

799
00:34:00.836 --> 00:34:02.586
and there is a reason
we're doing that.

800
00:34:02.586 --> 00:34:03.896
We're enumerating backwards

801
00:34:04.326 --> 00:34:09.596
because I've ordered my bezier
paths from biggest to smallest.

802
00:34:09.876 --> 00:34:11.206
And so, it's important--

803
00:34:11.206 --> 00:34:15.045
the array of elements that
we're creating are actually used

804
00:34:15.045 --> 00:34:16.176
for hit testing as well.

805
00:34:16.206 --> 00:34:19.186
As a user drags their finger
around the screen, you know,

806
00:34:19.186 --> 00:34:20.016
that's how we're hit testing

807
00:34:20.016 --> 00:34:22.406
for these accessibility
elements that we've created.

808
00:34:22.585 --> 00:34:25.186
And so we have to order these
from smallest to biggest.

809
00:34:25.186 --> 00:34:27.076
We want, you know,
elements that are

810
00:34:27.076 --> 00:34:29.545
above bigger elements
to be hit testable.

811
00:34:29.706 --> 00:34:32.136
If we put the largest
element on top, you know,

812
00:34:32.136 --> 00:34:34.126
none of the smaller sub-elements
would ever be reached.

813
00:34:34.315 --> 00:34:35.366
So, it's important in this case

814
00:34:35.366 --> 00:34:37.045
that we go backwards
through the array.

815
00:34:37.045 --> 00:34:38.585
And then again, at every step,

816
00:34:38.585 --> 00:34:40.396
we're going to create an
accessibility element,

817
00:34:40.946 --> 00:34:43.096
we're going to get an
appropriate accessibility label

818
00:34:43.096 --> 00:34:45.346
for that element and
we're going to get

819
00:34:45.585 --> 00:34:47.996
and set an appropriate
accessibility path

820
00:34:47.996 --> 00:34:48.585
for that element.

821
00:34:48.585 --> 00:34:50.576
And just like we have
a convenience function

822
00:34:50.876 --> 00:34:53.516
for converting frames
to screen coordinates,

823
00:34:53.596 --> 00:34:55.886
we also have the convenience
function for converting paths

824
00:34:55.886 --> 00:34:57.836
to screen coordinates
so it's really helpful.

825
00:34:59.056 --> 00:35:01.846
So, that's not it, we
have one more thing to do.

826
00:34:59.056 --> 00:35:01.846
So, that's not it, we
have one more thing to do.

827
00:35:02.156 --> 00:35:05.146
What happens when we change
floors or show or hide Coffee?

828
00:35:05.466 --> 00:35:07.796
Well we're going to need to
throw this array of elements

829
00:35:07.796 --> 00:35:09.186
out occasionally, right?

830
00:35:09.186 --> 00:35:10.636
If we select a different floor,

831
00:35:10.846 --> 00:35:13.446
those accessibility elements
we created are no longer valid.

832
00:35:14.036 --> 00:35:17.726
And so, anytime we set a floor,

833
00:35:18.376 --> 00:35:25.006
we can just simply
throw those rooms out.

834
00:35:27.076 --> 00:35:32.466
And similarly, if we change
the visibility of Coffee,

835
00:35:33.126 --> 00:35:34.906
we can just, again,
throw the rooms out.

836
00:35:35.116 --> 00:35:38.076
And the next time, VoiceOver or
an Accessibility feature calls

837
00:35:38.076 --> 00:35:40.636
in looking for them, they will
be just created, you know,

838
00:35:40.766 --> 00:35:42.326
with new updated information.

839
00:35:44.896 --> 00:35:48.106
Great. So, two more
problems we had.

840
00:35:48.106 --> 00:35:49.966
One, we still have to
fix our Coffee control,

841
00:35:49.966 --> 00:35:51.386
so let's go ahead
and do that now.

842
00:35:57.126 --> 00:35:59.276
And as I stated, the
new method we're looking

843
00:35:59.276 --> 00:36:01.586
for here is
accessibilityActivate.

844
00:35:59.276 --> 00:36:01.586
for here is
accessibilityActivate.

845
00:36:02.766 --> 00:36:05.576
And so if we jump to the header,
we again see that on state

846
00:36:05.736 --> 00:36:08.006
and really, all we want to
do is toggle that on state

847
00:36:08.746 --> 00:36:10.286
when VoiceOver double taps.

848
00:36:11.036 --> 00:36:16.826
So we can do self.on
equals not self.isOn

849
00:36:17.836 --> 00:36:20.426
and that should take care of it.

850
00:36:20.726 --> 00:36:23.966
And as I said before,
if we are handling it,

851
00:36:24.086 --> 00:36:26.416
we want to return yes and
in this case, obviously,

852
00:36:26.416 --> 00:36:27.566
we're handling it every time.

853
00:36:27.566 --> 00:36:28.976
Maybe you have some
more complex logic

854
00:36:29.226 --> 00:36:32.526
and this return value
is not constant.

855
00:36:33.136 --> 00:36:36.616
And then lastly, we have
this elevator control.

856
00:36:37.066 --> 00:36:39.696
We need to swipe up and
down to work appropriately.

857
00:36:40.666 --> 00:36:42.926
So, let's go ahead and find
the elevator control again.

858
00:36:43.536 --> 00:36:49.856
And the last two methods we need
to implement are two methods

859
00:36:49.856 --> 00:36:51.826
that work hand in hand
with the adjustable trait

860
00:36:52.136 --> 00:36:54.856
and those methods are
accessibilityDecrement

861
00:36:56.356 --> 00:37:00.186
and similarly,
accessibilityIncrement.

862
00:36:56.356 --> 00:37:00.186
and similarly,
accessibilityIncrement.

863
00:37:00.776 --> 00:37:06.276
And so, it just so happens,
I have a decrement floor

864
00:37:06.276 --> 00:37:09.786
and increment floor method and
so, this will be really easy.

865
00:37:10.386 --> 00:37:16.006
I can just go ahead and
call decrement floor

866
00:37:16.176 --> 00:37:19.346
in the accessibilityDecrement
method and similarly,

867
00:37:20.756 --> 00:37:23.086
increment floor in the
accessibilityIncrement method.

868
00:37:24.506 --> 00:37:29.756
Great. So let's clean
and go ahead

869
00:37:29.756 --> 00:37:31.196
and build our application
and see how we did.

870
00:37:31.696 --> 00:37:37.786
[ Pause ]

871
00:37:38.286 --> 00:37:40.176
Okay, let's turn VoiceOver on.

872
00:37:41.666 --> 00:37:43.386
>> VoiceOver on landscape.

873
00:37:44.696 --> 00:37:45.556
Home button to the left.

874
00:37:46.356 --> 00:37:48.636
>> So, let's go down and try
the elevator control first.

875
00:37:48.976 --> 00:37:50.146
>> Floor two.

876
00:37:50.256 --> 00:37:52.606
>> I'm going to stop
VoiceOver Speech

877
00:37:52.606 --> 00:37:54.516
by doing just a two
finger tap on the screen.

878
00:37:55.006 --> 00:37:57.506
Now, I remember the VoiceOver
told me to swipe up or down

879
00:37:57.506 --> 00:37:58.836
to adjust this so
let's swipe up.

880
00:37:59.256 --> 00:37:59.856
>> Two.

881
00:38:00.266 --> 00:38:04.646
>> And it did not
work and that happens.

882
00:38:05.586 --> 00:38:06.066
And so let's-- -

883
00:38:06.066 --> 00:38:06.466
>> Take time.

884
00:38:06.466 --> 00:38:07.196
>> Let's try repushing.

885
00:38:07.726 --> 00:38:15.446
>> Double tap to open.

886
00:38:15.446 --> 00:38:16.806
>> WW-- floor three.

887
00:38:16.896 --> 00:38:17.546
>> Okay, there we go.

888
00:38:17.546 --> 00:38:20.706
We just-- Xcode problem,
it was angry with us

889
00:38:21.116 --> 00:38:24.726
but so we repushed the code,
we can do the swipe up and now,

890
00:38:24.726 --> 00:38:25.386
we get the third floor.

891
00:38:25.386 --> 00:38:26.166
And if we swipe down-- -

892
00:38:26.366 --> 00:38:26.856
>> Two.

893
00:38:27.076 --> 00:38:27.806
>> Second floor.

894
00:38:28.006 --> 00:38:28.316
>> One.

895
00:38:28.526 --> 00:38:28.976
>> First floor.

896
00:38:28.976 --> 00:38:29.306
Great.

897
00:38:29.826 --> 00:38:30.146
>> Coffee--

898
00:38:30.356 --> 00:38:31.446
>> Let's try that
Coffee control.

899
00:38:31.526 --> 00:38:33.336
I'm going to double tap on it.

900
00:38:33.806 --> 00:38:34.816
>> Coffee on.

901
00:38:34.816 --> 00:38:35.216
>> And you can see

902
00:38:35.216 --> 00:38:37.456
that VoiceOver produces
the appropriate noise

903
00:38:37.456 --> 00:38:38.956
to let the user know
that yes, this worked.

904
00:38:39.166 --> 00:38:41.086
Everything is happy,
we now see Coffee.

905
00:38:41.426 --> 00:38:44.096
And now really, the biggest
issue is how did we do

906
00:38:44.096 --> 00:38:45.216
in terms of the path?

907
00:38:45.686 --> 00:38:47.216
So, let's touch in to the lobby.

908
00:38:47.526 --> 00:38:47.946
>> Lobby.

909
00:38:48.756 --> 00:38:49.836
>> Great. So now, we can see

910
00:38:49.836 --> 00:38:51.256
that VoiceOver knows
about the lobby.

911
00:38:51.526 --> 00:38:54.096
And if I move my finger
down, take the escalator.

912
00:38:54.156 --> 00:38:54.736
>> Escalator.

913
00:38:54.876 --> 00:38:55.656
>> I see the escalator.

914
00:38:55.696 --> 00:38:57.896
And now, I can just
kind of move up and I'm

915
00:38:57.896 --> 00:38:59.436
in the lobby, I'm
still moving up.

916
00:38:59.466 --> 00:38:59.876
>> Stairs.

917
00:38:59.876 --> 00:39:01.286
>> And I get to the
stairs eventually.

918
00:38:59.876 --> 00:39:01.286
>> And I get to the
stairs eventually.

919
00:39:01.286 --> 00:39:04.256
So you can see that this allows
VoiceOver users to, you know,

920
00:39:04.256 --> 00:39:06.716
move their finger around the
screen and really get a sense

921
00:39:06.716 --> 00:39:08.316
of the spatial nature
of this Map.

922
00:39:08.836 --> 00:39:11.256
>> Hold hot coffee.

923
00:39:11.556 --> 00:39:12.886
>> Thankfully, even
Coffee works.

924
00:39:14.466 --> 00:39:28.746
>> VoiceOver off.

925
00:39:28.746 --> 00:39:29.556
[ Pause ]

926
00:39:29.556 --> 00:39:30.366
[ Applause ]

927
00:39:30.366 --> 00:39:32.716
>> Great. So as I said, you
can see we took this really

928
00:39:32.716 --> 00:39:35.426
inaccessible application
and made it Accessible

929
00:39:35.616 --> 00:39:36.726
with just a little bit of work.

930
00:39:37.066 --> 00:39:38.496
And, you know, I
think you're going

931
00:39:38.496 --> 00:39:40.306
to find that's the
case for you as well.

932
00:39:41.166 --> 00:39:43.056
And so now, let's move
on to Guided Access.

933
00:39:43.276 --> 00:39:44.666
I want to talk about a
few things we learned

934
00:39:44.756 --> 00:39:47.636
from Guided Access since
we introduced it in iOS 6.

935
00:39:47.936 --> 00:39:50.106
And so, the first thing we
learned was hardware buttons

936
00:39:50.106 --> 00:39:50.646
are useful.

937
00:39:50.966 --> 00:39:53.116
Our initial approach
with Guided Access was

938
00:39:53.116 --> 00:39:54.236
when Guided Access is active.

939
00:39:54.556 --> 00:39:56.876
We kind of remove all
hardware buttons, you know,

940
00:39:56.876 --> 00:39:58.256
none of them work,
we really want

941
00:39:58.256 --> 00:39:59.386
to remove all those
distractions.

942
00:39:59.676 --> 00:40:02.196
But we got some feedback and,
you know, it turns out a lot

943
00:39:59.676 --> 00:40:02.196
But we got some feedback and,
you know, it turns out a lot

944
00:40:02.196 --> 00:40:03.746
of really powerful
great, you know,

945
00:40:03.746 --> 00:40:05.516
camera apps use the
volume buttons

946
00:40:05.756 --> 00:40:07.806
and other apps use more
buttons for different things

947
00:40:07.806 --> 00:40:10.476
so lesson number one,
hardware buttons are useful.

948
00:40:11.066 --> 00:40:15.146
Lesson number two is if you want
to occlude a region from touch

949
00:40:15.146 --> 00:40:18.096
in Guided Access, currently,
you know, you draw an area

950
00:40:18.096 --> 00:40:19.546
around that region on the--

951
00:40:19.626 --> 00:40:22.236
that area becomes grade out
when Guided Access is active.

952
00:40:22.486 --> 00:40:23.306
And so, that works great.

953
00:40:23.306 --> 00:40:25.286
You can disable buttons
as you need to.

954
00:40:25.286 --> 00:40:28.716
The only problem is this doesn't
address the visual distractions

955
00:40:28.756 --> 00:40:31.106
associated with the application
and so, that's the problem

956
00:40:31.106 --> 00:40:33.476
and we think we can do better.

957
00:40:33.596 --> 00:40:35.616
And lastly, developers
are eager to adapt.

958
00:40:35.786 --> 00:40:38.526
A lot of you reached
out to us and, you know,

959
00:40:38.526 --> 00:40:40.026
that's what drove this API.

960
00:40:40.026 --> 00:40:42.066
And so, we're really
happy to show it to you

961
00:40:42.066 --> 00:40:43.036
and see how you use it.

962
00:40:43.556 --> 00:40:46.776
And so, the best way to
explain this is to jump right in

963
00:40:46.836 --> 00:40:48.896
and just give a demo
of Guided Access.

964
00:40:48.896 --> 00:40:48.963
[ Pause ]

965
00:40:48.963 --> 00:40:58.666
So now, I'm going to return to
the Accessibility Settings menu,

966
00:41:00.056 --> 00:41:01.466
to General Accessibility.

967
00:41:01.536 --> 00:41:06.666
I'm going to scroll down, remove
VoiceOver from my shortcut

968
00:41:06.786 --> 00:41:08.586
and instead, add Guided Access.

969
00:41:09.196 --> 00:41:11.356
I'm going to go ahead
and set a passcode

970
00:41:11.356 --> 00:41:13.866
for Guided Access, nobody look.

971
00:41:14.476 --> 00:41:18.906
Great. So we're all setup,
let's open our application.

972
00:41:24.236 --> 00:41:25.626
And so, if I click three times

973
00:41:26.436 --> 00:41:27.816
and enter the Guided
Access workspace.

974
00:41:28.966 --> 00:41:31.336
So, what if we want to share
this application with someone

975
00:41:31.656 --> 00:41:33.576
or maybe we're a
developer that wants

976
00:41:33.576 --> 00:41:35.776
to develop one application
for two purposes?

977
00:41:36.036 --> 00:41:39.336
One application to give to
users of say a conference

978
00:41:39.336 --> 00:41:43.186
at this venue and that same
application to maybe post

979
00:41:43.186 --> 00:41:45.296
around the halls and
just display the floors.

980
00:41:45.766 --> 00:41:47.576
So, maybe you want to
hide certain controls

981
00:41:47.576 --> 00:41:49.466
or really change the user
interface on the fly.

982
00:41:49.986 --> 00:41:53.686
And so up until now, really, the
only option you've had is again,

983
00:41:54.046 --> 00:41:56.196
to circle these controls
you want to occlude

984
00:41:56.506 --> 00:41:59.356
and then VoiceOver or-- and
then Guided Access will disallow

985
00:41:59.356 --> 00:42:00.866
touch from happening
in these places

986
00:41:59.356 --> 00:42:00.866
touch from happening
in these places

987
00:42:01.066 --> 00:42:02.766
and so users won't be able
to change these things.

988
00:42:02.816 --> 00:42:06.936
But again, especially if you're
developing one application

989
00:42:06.936 --> 00:42:10.486
for both users in Kiosk, these
visual distractions still exist

990
00:42:10.486 --> 00:42:12.026
and it, you know, it looks
pretty unprofessional

991
00:42:12.026 --> 00:42:12.506
in that case.

992
00:42:12.546 --> 00:42:15.636
And so, let's go ahead
and remove those regions.

993
00:42:16.226 --> 00:42:20.306
And so now, in Guided Access
in iOS 7, any app that's bought

994
00:42:20.306 --> 00:42:22.996
into this developer API
will have this new option

995
00:42:23.316 --> 00:42:24.796
that we can see in the
bottom right corner

996
00:42:25.096 --> 00:42:28.186
and you're presented with
options button and an icon

997
00:42:28.186 --> 00:42:29.896
of your application and
your application's name.

998
00:42:30.186 --> 00:42:31.486
And so, when I touch
that options button,

999
00:42:31.866 --> 00:42:35.586
up pops this list of
all of the restrictions

1000
00:42:35.666 --> 00:42:37.806
that my application wants
to provide to the user.

1001
00:42:38.066 --> 00:42:41.096
And so in this case, we see that
we have a controls restriction

1002
00:42:41.306 --> 00:42:43.816
and some detail text that kind
of explains the implications

1003
00:42:43.816 --> 00:42:44.696
of using this control.

1004
00:42:44.696 --> 00:42:47.666
In this case, these
controls adjust the floor

1005
00:42:47.666 --> 00:42:48.356
and show Coffee.

1006
00:42:48.356 --> 00:42:50.576
And so, if I go ahead and
turn those controls off

1007
00:42:51.156 --> 00:42:54.696
and resume Guided Access,
what happens is we call

1008
00:42:54.696 --> 00:42:56.736
into your application and
we tell you, you know,

1009
00:42:56.886 --> 00:43:00.486
the user wants to make
these changes, you know,

1010
00:42:56.886 --> 00:43:00.486
the user wants to make
these changes, you know,

1011
00:43:00.626 --> 00:43:03.086
act appropriately, and
then it's your job--

1012
00:43:03.086 --> 00:43:05.786
this is your opportunity to
then go into your application

1013
00:43:05.786 --> 00:43:07.416
and make the appropriate
visual changes

1014
00:43:07.606 --> 00:43:09.326
or respond otherwise
accordingly.

1015
00:43:09.896 --> 00:43:16.006
And so similarly, if we go back
in, turn the controls back on

1016
00:43:16.376 --> 00:43:17.756
and resume, you can see

1017
00:43:17.756 --> 00:43:20.616
that your application is given
another call and, you know,

1018
00:43:20.616 --> 00:43:23.586
here is your chance to
re-add those controls

1019
00:43:23.586 --> 00:43:25.086
to your view hierarchy.

1020
00:43:25.656 --> 00:43:27.736
So that is the new Guided
Access Developer API

1021
00:43:27.916 --> 00:43:29.286
so let's take a look
at how it works.

1022
00:43:35.746 --> 00:43:36.826
So right off the
bat, the first things

1023
00:43:36.856 --> 00:43:40.526
to note are these restrictions
are per application,

1024
00:43:40.526 --> 00:43:43.086
they are not per view they
are not per view controller.

1025
00:43:43.086 --> 00:43:45.376
And because of that,
the appropriate place

1026
00:43:45.376 --> 00:43:48.566
to implement them is on
your UIApplicationDelegate.

1027
00:43:48.566 --> 00:43:51.066
So, this protocol exists
there and there alone.

1028
00:43:51.466 --> 00:43:54.046
The second thing is we
wanted to make buying

1029
00:43:54.046 --> 00:43:55.436
in as easy as possible.

1030
00:43:55.436 --> 00:43:57.406
We really wanted to
lower the bar and,

1031
00:43:57.406 --> 00:43:58.586
you know, make adaption easy.

1032
00:43:58.876 --> 00:44:01.226
And so for that reason,
state persistence comes free.

1033
00:43:58.876 --> 00:44:01.226
And so for that reason,
state persistence comes free.

1034
00:44:01.526 --> 00:44:03.836
You don't have to maintain
state in your application

1035
00:44:04.126 --> 00:44:06.646
of what the user has currently
set this restriction to.

1036
00:44:06.816 --> 00:44:10.296
We do that for you and we simply
call you anytime you need to,

1037
00:44:10.296 --> 00:44:12.866
you know, update your
interface as appropriate.

1038
00:44:13.376 --> 00:44:16.646
And so, the first three
methods that we're going to look

1039
00:44:16.676 --> 00:44:18.996
at are guidedAccessRestriction
Identifiers,

1040
00:44:19.256 --> 00:44:21.226
textForGuided
AccessRestrictionWith

1041
00:44:21.226 --> 00:44:23.326
Identifier: and detailed
TextForGuided

1042
00:44:23.326 --> 00:44:24.806
AccessRestrictionWith
Identifier:.

1043
00:44:24.866 --> 00:44:26.986
And so let's start from the top.

1044
00:44:27.276 --> 00:44:29.976
In Guided Access restriction
identifiers, you're going

1045
00:44:29.976 --> 00:44:33.806
to want to return a unique
restriction identifier

1046
00:44:34.326 --> 00:44:36.006
for every restriction that you'd

1047
00:44:36.006 --> 00:44:39.706
like to enable the
user to control.

1048
00:44:39.936 --> 00:44:42.456
And so in this case, I've just,
you know, made a static string

1049
00:44:42.456 --> 00:44:44.426
for this to, again, for
brevity to kind of shorten it.

1050
00:44:44.806 --> 00:44:49.626
But the header offers
more on the way to do this

1051
00:44:49.626 --> 00:44:52.726
and we really recommend that
you use reversed DNS notation.

1052
00:44:52.726 --> 00:44:55.466
These all need to be
unique in your application.

1053
00:44:56.746 --> 00:44:58.846
So again, here is where
you would return an array

1054
00:44:58.846 --> 00:44:59.656
of these strings.

1055
00:45:00.076 --> 00:45:02.396
And then, the other two
methods we're going to call

1056
00:45:02.396 --> 00:45:03.776
into your application
when we detect

1057
00:45:04.126 --> 00:45:05.476
that you have a restriction
you'd

1058
00:45:05.476 --> 00:45:06.426
like to convey to the user.

1059
00:45:06.756 --> 00:45:08.756
Then for each restriction
identifier,

1060
00:45:08.956 --> 00:45:10.746
we call in your application
and we say, you know,

1061
00:45:10.746 --> 00:45:12.526
what is the text you would
like presented to the user

1062
00:45:12.526 --> 00:45:13.736
for this restriction identifier?

1063
00:45:14.026 --> 00:45:15.996
And similarly, what is
the detail text you would

1064
00:45:15.996 --> 00:45:17.006
like presented to the user.

1065
00:45:17.236 --> 00:45:19.206
So this is your chance
to give that to us

1066
00:45:19.206 --> 00:45:20.386
and we will display
it to the user.

1067
00:45:20.686 --> 00:45:22.626
I mean you can see here, I'm
not actually checking the

1068
00:45:22.626 --> 00:45:26.026
restriction IDs, we only have
one restriction so, you know,

1069
00:45:26.026 --> 00:45:28.146
we can go ahead and safely
just return the values

1070
00:45:28.146 --> 00:45:29.036
for our one restriction.

1071
00:45:29.986 --> 00:45:32.866
And the last method is mouthful
that we want to take a look at.

1072
00:45:33.176 --> 00:45:36.316
guidedAccessRestriction
WithIdentifier:did ChangeState:.

1073
00:45:36.676 --> 00:45:38.216
So, this is what I was
talking about before

1074
00:45:38.446 --> 00:45:40.286
and the reason you don't
have to maintain state

1075
00:45:40.286 --> 00:45:42.666
in your application,
we're doing that for you.

1076
00:45:42.666 --> 00:45:45.846
And anytime the state for
restriction identifier changes,

1077
00:45:46.116 --> 00:45:49.296
we simply call into this
method with the restriction ID

1078
00:45:49.296 --> 00:45:51.246
and with the new state
of that restriction

1079
00:45:51.456 --> 00:45:52.636
and this is really your chance

1080
00:45:52.636 --> 00:45:55.026
to update your user
interface as appropriate.

1081
00:45:55.266 --> 00:45:58.966
And so here, we're doing self--
set control enabled enabled.

1082
00:46:00.116 --> 00:46:02.706
And lastly, we do
have a helper function

1083
00:46:02.996 --> 00:46:05.036
that will let you check
the state of a restriction

1084
00:46:05.266 --> 00:46:06.756
at any time if you need to.

1085
00:46:07.626 --> 00:46:11.346
So that's Guided Access and, you
know, we're really happy to get

1086
00:46:11.346 --> 00:46:13.556
out there, we're excited to see
what you're going to do with it.

1087
00:46:13.556 --> 00:46:15.486
You know, you asked
for it, we delivered it

1088
00:46:15.486 --> 00:46:18.606
but there's one more thing that
you asked for over the years

1089
00:46:18.606 --> 00:46:19.816
and we're really happy
to give it to you today

1090
00:46:19.816 --> 00:46:22.796
and that's a brand new
Text-to-Speech API.

1091
00:46:23.296 --> 00:46:28.926
[ Applause ]

1092
00:46:29.426 --> 00:46:30.766
So, we know a lot
of applications

1093
00:46:30.876 --> 00:46:33.656
in the App Store have some
Text-To-Speech functionality.

1094
00:46:33.656 --> 00:46:36.806
And really, up until today,
your only option has been to,

1095
00:46:36.966 --> 00:46:39.306
you know, roll your own
Text-To-Speech ability

1096
00:46:39.306 --> 00:46:41.716
into your application
and while this works,

1097
00:46:41.716 --> 00:46:43.446
it can make your
application quite large.

1098
00:46:43.726 --> 00:46:46.136
And so, we have gone
ahead and added this in

1099
00:46:46.216 --> 00:46:48.646
and the good news is it's
extremely easy to use,

1100
00:46:48.646 --> 00:46:50.266
you can use it in
just three lines,

1101
00:46:50.266 --> 00:46:51.626
you can make your
application speak.

1102
00:46:51.626 --> 00:46:53.246
And now, you have this,
you know, this option.

1103
00:46:53.726 --> 00:46:57.506
First you just allocate and
initialize a synthesizer object.

1104
00:46:58.366 --> 00:47:00.666
Second, you make an
utterance out of a string

1105
00:46:58.366 --> 00:47:00.666
Second, you make an
utterance out of a string

1106
00:47:00.736 --> 00:47:01.766
that you'd like to speak.

1107
00:47:02.696 --> 00:47:05.776
And last, you just speak the
utterance and it's that easy.

1108
00:47:05.776 --> 00:47:07.846
You can make your app
speak with just three lines

1109
00:47:08.386 --> 00:47:11.376
and it's also worth noting
that this works in Safari.

1110
00:47:12.346 --> 00:47:15.126
There are some Web Speech,
there is a Web Speech ability

1111
00:47:15.356 --> 00:47:18.406
that you can leverage to get
this to work right from Safari

1112
00:47:18.406 --> 00:47:19.736
if you're working on
a web application.

1113
00:47:21.676 --> 00:47:23.856
Great. So for more
information, go ahead

1114
00:47:23.856 --> 00:47:25.606
and check our documentation.

1115
00:47:25.606 --> 00:47:28.276
We have a great wealth of
Accessibility documentation

1116
00:47:28.446 --> 00:47:29.436
that should help
you get started.

1117
00:47:30.036 --> 00:47:31.646
And if you, you know, you
have deeper questions,

1118
00:47:31.646 --> 00:47:33.176
the dev forms are always
a great place to go

1119
00:47:33.176 --> 00:47:35.136
for those deeper questions.

1120
00:47:36.206 --> 00:47:40.496
For related sessions, there is
a desktop accessibility talk

1121
00:47:40.866 --> 00:47:43.676
in this room directly
following this so stick

1122
00:47:43.676 --> 00:47:46.686
around if you're interested
in desktop accessibility.

1123
00:47:47.036 --> 00:47:52.216
Or if you are interested
in developing, you know,

1124
00:47:52.216 --> 00:47:53.436
Made For iPhone hearing aids,

1125
00:47:53.746 --> 00:47:57.276
or switches for our Switch
Control feature, you can come

1126
00:47:57.276 --> 00:48:02.206
over to the designing
accessories for iOS and OS X.

1127
00:47:57.276 --> 00:48:02.206
over to the designing
accessories for iOS and OS X.

1128
00:48:02.526 --> 00:48:06.536
I mean, that is also directly
following us over in Nob Hill.

1129
00:48:08.556 --> 00:48:11.086
So in summary, we saw that
adding accessibility is easy,

1130
00:48:11.376 --> 00:48:15.196
I mean, we made this application
accessible with just a few lines

1131
00:48:15.236 --> 00:48:17.206
and it was, you know,
virtually inaccessible before.

1132
00:48:17.856 --> 00:48:20.806
It's going to get you more
users and great feedback.

1133
00:48:20.806 --> 00:48:21.856
We've always found
throughout the years

1134
00:48:21.856 --> 00:48:24.286
that the Accessibility
communities provide us

1135
00:48:24.286 --> 00:48:25.326
with great feedback.

1136
00:48:25.916 --> 00:48:27.566
And then lastly, you know,

1137
00:48:27.566 --> 00:48:29.636
we take accessibility
very seriously here.

1138
00:48:30.016 --> 00:48:32.496
And so, we want you to too
and it's that partnership

1139
00:48:32.536 --> 00:48:37.066
that has made iOS really the
best mobile accessibility

1140
00:48:37.066 --> 00:48:37.716
platform out there.

1141
00:48:38.936 --> 00:48:39.846
Thank you all for coming.
