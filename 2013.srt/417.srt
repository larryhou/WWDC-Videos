00:00:10.656 --> 00:00:16.556
>> Sal Soghoian: Welcome to
WWDC and especially welcome

3
00:00:16.556 --> 00:00:19.836
to the first session
on automation today.

4
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:20.806
We have two.

5
00:00:20.806 --> 00:00:25.486
This one's an overview of
all the new different things

6
00:00:25.486 --> 00:00:28.296
in automation, and there's
a lot to talk about today.

7
00:00:29.206 --> 00:00:33.726
I'll be joined in this
presentation by Chris Nebel.

8
00:00:33.726 --> 00:00:38.306
He's the Senior Automation
Engineer and, when he comes back

9
00:00:38.306 --> 00:00:40.296
from being wired up,
he'll stand over here

10
00:00:40.296 --> 00:00:42.096
and do some of the demos.

11
00:00:42.416 --> 00:00:45.436
But, like I said, we
have a lot to talk about.

12
00:00:45.986 --> 00:00:48.316
There's been a lot of
work and a lot of changes,

13
00:00:48.316 --> 00:00:50.376
and I think you're going to
enjoy some of these things.

14
00:00:50.376 --> 00:00:51.206
So let's begin.

15
00:00:54.076 --> 00:00:56.676
So what's new in the
world of automation?

16
00:00:56.956 --> 00:01:00.636
Well, without actually just
bullet pointing the whole list,

17
00:00:56.956 --> 00:01:00.636
Well, without actually just
bullet pointing the whole list,

18
00:01:01.196 --> 00:01:05.465
we're going to be talking about
Automator and AppleScript.

19
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:09.376
Especially we're going to
introduce some new features.

20
00:01:09.716 --> 00:01:11.086
They're very powerful.

21
00:01:11.086 --> 00:01:12.426
Some of them are
pretty dramatic.

22
00:01:12.426 --> 00:01:14.616
I think you're going to find

23
00:01:14.756 --> 00:01:18.126
that they become your
favorite things to work with.

24
00:01:19.456 --> 00:01:23.806
And we're going to look at
multiple computer file access.

25
00:01:24.786 --> 00:01:29.306
We'll be looking at some
security transparency issues,

26
00:01:29.886 --> 00:01:35.056
some new OS X integration
that we've created,

27
00:01:35.056 --> 00:01:38.186
and getting your
computer to pay attention

28
00:01:38.186 --> 00:01:39.886
to what you want
it to do for you.

29
00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:43.906
So those are my mystery
topics here, and we'll begin

30
00:01:43.906 --> 00:01:48.296
with the simplest
multicomputer file integration

31
00:01:48.296 --> 00:01:50.466
which is iCloud support,

32
00:01:51.206 --> 00:01:53.236
specifically documents
in the Cloud.

33
00:01:53.896 --> 00:01:56.366
Now, you're all familiar
with how this works.

34
00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:58.676
You can create a
document on one computer.

35
00:01:58.676 --> 00:02:02.376
You store it in the Cloud, and
it automatically gets pushed

36
00:01:58.676 --> 00:02:02.376
You store it in the Cloud, and
it automatically gets pushed

37
00:02:02.756 --> 00:02:06.386
to another computer using
your same iCloud account.

38
00:02:07.186 --> 00:02:10.116
Now, through the magic of
automation and iCloud support,

39
00:02:10.406 --> 00:02:16.406
we've incorporated this into the
AppleScript Editor, and it works

40
00:02:16.546 --> 00:02:18.526
in the same way that
you're used to working

41
00:02:18.526 --> 00:02:19.906
with other applications

42
00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:22.136
that have document
in the Cloud support.

43
00:02:22.136 --> 00:02:25.476
You can drag your favorite
scripts and applets right

44
00:02:25.476 --> 00:02:28.256
into the iCloud window.

45
00:02:28.506 --> 00:02:31.576
They'll automatically load
and go up to the server.

46
00:02:31.766 --> 00:02:36.596
And then you can search based
upon tags that you've applied:

47
00:02:37.106 --> 00:02:39.676
key words, names,
those kind of things.

48
00:02:40.366 --> 00:02:43.036
And, in addition, you can
use some of the resources

49
00:02:43.166 --> 00:02:48.886
of the iCloud viewer to sort
and organize your scripts

50
00:02:49.226 --> 00:02:53.036
and to be able to use the
shared menu to send them,

51
00:02:53.926 --> 00:02:58.586
share them over iDrop,
AirDrop or iMessage

52
00:02:58.586 --> 00:02:59.516
or something like that.

53
00:02:59.516 --> 00:03:04.456
So here's an AirDrop example
where you're taking something

54
00:02:59.516 --> 00:03:04.456
So here's an AirDrop example
where you're taking something

55
00:03:04.456 --> 00:03:06.616
from your Cloud and
you're sharing it across.

56
00:03:06.976 --> 00:03:07.486
Hello there.

57
00:03:08.026 --> 00:03:12.456
And we've incorporated this,
too, for Automator as well.

58
00:03:13.196 --> 00:03:16.106
So not overly dramatic,
but you know what?

59
00:03:16.206 --> 00:03:20.616
Being a script hoarder like
me, I'm actually starting

60
00:03:20.616 --> 00:03:23.146
to like having one
place that I can go

61
00:03:23.146 --> 00:03:26.776
to where I know I'll
find what I'm looking for

62
00:03:27.026 --> 00:03:28.686
and copy it to the machine.

63
00:03:28.686 --> 00:03:30.226
It's been very, very useful.

64
00:03:30.226 --> 00:03:32.286
I think you're going
to find it useful too;

65
00:03:32.696 --> 00:03:36.536
and you'll soon make
this just part

66
00:03:36.536 --> 00:03:39.736
of your normal everyday
life with the editors.

67
00:03:41.196 --> 00:03:44.906
Next we're going to look at
automation applets and security.

68
00:03:45.706 --> 00:03:48.236
So the other day I get
an email from a friend

69
00:03:48.236 --> 00:03:49.606
of mine, Trudy Anchover.

70
00:03:49.986 --> 00:03:50.796
She's head of the --

71
00:03:50.926 --> 00:03:53.756
she's Director for the
Bay Area Forest Scouts,

72
00:03:54.146 --> 00:03:55.906
and she was at a
conference with me.

73
00:03:55.906 --> 00:03:58.886
She saw me demonstrate
this little photo droplet.

74
00:03:59.446 --> 00:04:01.096
And she asked me in
an email, you know,

75
00:03:59.446 --> 00:04:01.096
And she asked me in
an email, you know,

76
00:04:01.096 --> 00:04:02.806
Can you share that with me?

77
00:04:02.806 --> 00:04:04.086
It would really help me out.

78
00:04:04.316 --> 00:04:06.106
So I didn't think
twice about it.

79
00:04:06.106 --> 00:04:09.406
I just, you know, instantly
replied in an email message

80
00:04:09.406 --> 00:04:11.306
to her, addressed
the email message.

81
00:04:11.726 --> 00:04:14.176
I found the droplet, added it

82
00:04:14.176 --> 00:04:16.065
to the email message,
and sent it to her.

83
00:04:16.065 --> 00:04:18.406
I didn't think twice about this.

84
00:04:19.016 --> 00:04:20.565
And then I send it to Trudy.

85
00:04:20.896 --> 00:04:26.786
So when Trudy gets it on her
machine, she takes the droplet

86
00:04:26.786 --> 00:04:29.126
from mail, drags
it to the desktop,

87
00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:31.586
and is ready to use the droplet.

88
00:04:31.586 --> 00:04:34.646
She selects an image and drags
it on top of the droplet.

89
00:04:35.236 --> 00:04:37.116
And, instead of getting
processing,

90
00:04:37.116 --> 00:04:41.386
she gets this dialog saying
that this droplet can't be run

91
00:04:41.386 --> 00:04:44.186
because it's from an
unidentified developer

92
00:04:44.516 --> 00:04:47.576
and that her settings
for security are set

93
00:04:47.576 --> 00:04:53.396
to only use apple --
applets from the Apple Store

94
00:04:53.396 --> 00:04:55.436
or from known developers.

95
00:04:55.946 --> 00:04:59.026
Now, that's because,
in the Security

96
00:04:59.026 --> 00:05:04.166
and Privacy Control Panel, she's
using a default setting which is

97
00:04:59.026 --> 00:05:04.166
and Privacy Control Panel, she's
using a default setting which is

98
00:05:04.166 --> 00:05:07.036
for Mac App Store and
identified developers.

99
00:05:07.486 --> 00:05:10.686
Trudy's not a particularly
sophisticated user,

100
00:05:10.686 --> 00:05:13.356
and so she doesn't know how
to bypass this or anything.

101
00:05:13.636 --> 00:05:16.046
It just -- to her,
it's just broken.

102
00:05:16.426 --> 00:05:20.546
And it's really my fault because
I forgot a very important thing

103
00:05:20.796 --> 00:05:24.196
is that Automator and
AppleScript droplets

104
00:05:24.196 --> 00:05:26.806
and applets are applications.

105
00:05:26.996 --> 00:05:30.016
And, because they are
applications, they're subject

106
00:05:30.016 --> 00:05:32.406
to the same level
of security scrutiny

107
00:05:32.406 --> 00:05:35.216
as any other application
on the OS.

108
00:05:35.876 --> 00:05:38.526
So, in order for them
to function correctly,

109
00:05:38.736 --> 00:05:43.556
they really do need to be signed
to be Gatekeeper approved.

110
00:05:44.576 --> 00:05:47.386
And you can try doing
that with the Terminal

111
00:05:47.386 --> 00:05:49.916
and some magic commands,
if you like;

112
00:05:50.326 --> 00:05:54.646
but now in Mavericks we are
introducing code signing support

113
00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:56.696
built into our editing apps.

114
00:05:58.516 --> 00:06:01.546
[ Applause ]

115
00:05:58.516 --> 00:06:01.546
[ Applause ]

116
00:06:02.046 --> 00:06:02.726
Yeah. Really nice.

117
00:06:03.136 --> 00:06:06.766
And it requires that you have,
you know, your developer ID,

118
00:06:06.926 --> 00:06:11.396
which you do, and that you
have the Xcode installed

119
00:06:11.396 --> 00:06:12.956
with the command line tools.

120
00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:16.146
And, since we're
all developers here,

121
00:06:16.146 --> 00:06:17.776
you're used to this concept

122
00:06:18.076 --> 00:06:21.296
because you've been preparing
your apps for the Store anyway.

123
00:06:21.296 --> 00:06:24.076
So you're used to
sending out signed copies.

124
00:06:24.396 --> 00:06:26.846
And you already have
your developer ID

125
00:06:26.846 --> 00:06:29.496
and certificates
installed into the keychain.

126
00:06:30.286 --> 00:06:33.586
So, once you do, then you
can use this new feature.

127
00:06:33.586 --> 00:06:35.466
And let me show you
what it looks like.

128
00:06:35.946 --> 00:06:37.666
Here, in the AppleScript Editor,

129
00:06:38.196 --> 00:06:40.836
I'm going to export
the droplet for Trudy.

130
00:06:41.266 --> 00:06:44.746
And so I go to the File
menu and choose Export.

131
00:06:48.436 --> 00:06:51.156
And when I do, I get
the dropdown sheet.

132
00:06:51.486 --> 00:06:56.416
You'll notice that there's a
new pop-up menu at the bottom

133
00:06:56.416 --> 00:07:00.256
of the Save sheet and
it says code sign.

134
00:06:56.416 --> 00:07:00.256
of the Save sheet and
it says code sign.

135
00:07:00.926 --> 00:07:03.296
It's for code signing
and, by default,

136
00:07:03.296 --> 00:07:05.666
it's set to don't code sign.

137
00:07:06.136 --> 00:07:08.766
But if you do click
that pop-up menu,

138
00:07:09.016 --> 00:07:12.006
all of your developer
identities that are installed

139
00:07:12.006 --> 00:07:14.426
on that computer will
appear in this list.

140
00:07:14.946 --> 00:07:16.796
It's just simply a
matter at that point

141
00:07:16.796 --> 00:07:19.076
of choosing the identity
that you want

142
00:07:20.176 --> 00:07:23.646
and then clicking the Save
button, and it will save a copy

143
00:07:23.646 --> 00:07:28.666
of that droplet or applet
signed ready to deliver.

144
00:07:28.836 --> 00:07:31.376
So, if I had done this for
Trudy, she wouldn't have had any

145
00:07:31.376 --> 00:07:33.876
of the problems that
she came across.

146
00:07:35.106 --> 00:07:38.186
For Automator, it's
a similar process.

147
00:07:38.186 --> 00:07:41.916
So here I have a workflow
open in Automator.

148
00:07:41.916 --> 00:07:45.526
This is one I use for
video editing quite a bit

149
00:07:46.106 --> 00:07:50.256
and creating a compressed
video version from raw source.

150
00:07:50.776 --> 00:07:53.616
And so, to do the same export,

151
00:07:53.616 --> 00:07:56.666
I just go to the File
menu, choose Export.

152
00:07:57.506 --> 00:08:00.076
I get the Save sheet
in Automator.

153
00:07:57.506 --> 00:08:00.076
I get the Save sheet
in Automator.

154
00:08:00.466 --> 00:08:01.836
And at the bottom
of the Save sheet

155
00:08:01.836 --> 00:08:06.256
in Automator is also a
code sign pop-up menu.

156
00:08:06.406 --> 00:08:10.126
Again, I can select from that
menu the developer identity

157
00:08:10.126 --> 00:08:14.146
that I'm looking for, pick
that, and then just click Save.

158
00:08:15.696 --> 00:08:19.196
The applet will be saved
to wherever I indicated,

159
00:08:19.196 --> 00:08:21.616
and it's signed and
ready to be distributed.

160
00:08:22.066 --> 00:08:24.196
It's really that
easy to use these.

161
00:08:24.526 --> 00:08:28.256
And, to show you that, I'm going
to turn to my friend Chris Nebel

162
00:08:28.706 --> 00:08:30.516
and have Chris demonstrate.

163
00:08:31.216 --> 00:08:32.456
Thank you.

164
00:08:33.515 --> 00:08:36.546
[ Applause ]

165
00:08:37.046 --> 00:08:37.566
>> Chris Nebel: Thank you, Sal.

166
00:08:38.616 --> 00:08:40.916
So let's take a look at how
Maverick makes it easier

167
00:08:40.916 --> 00:08:44.786
to code sign your workflows,
applets, applications

168
00:08:45.126 --> 00:08:47.036
so you can distribute
them to other users.

169
00:08:49.066 --> 00:08:52.366
So I've got an applet
I've been working on here.

170
00:08:52.366 --> 00:08:53.896
Notice getting this
out of iCloud.

171
00:08:54.586 --> 00:08:57.496
It's working on another machine.

172
00:08:58.116 --> 00:09:00.206
And I worked long and
hard on this applet.

173
00:08:58.116 --> 00:09:00.206
And I worked long and
hard on this applet.

174
00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:01.026
I'm very proud of it.

175
00:09:01.196 --> 00:09:04.736
I'm ready to send
it out to the world.

176
00:09:04.736 --> 00:09:07.916
And, historically, what I
would do is I'd just, you know,

177
00:09:08.056 --> 00:09:10.486
stick this in an email
message, send it off,

178
00:09:10.486 --> 00:09:12.316
and the other person
would grab it from there.

179
00:09:12.686 --> 00:09:15.226
So I have an applet
that simulates uploading

180
00:09:15.226 --> 00:09:18.326
and downloading it, so it will
pop up in the Downloads folder.

181
00:09:18.916 --> 00:09:28.256
And, if I open this now, I get
this dialog, and it's saying

182
00:09:28.256 --> 00:09:29.776
that it can't open
this because it's

183
00:09:29.776 --> 00:09:30.956
from an unidentified developer.

184
00:09:30.956 --> 00:09:34.096
This is the default Gatekeeper
policy on everyone's system.

185
00:09:34.476 --> 00:09:38.046
And OK here doesn't mean
"okay, go ahead and run it".

186
00:09:38.046 --> 00:09:39.706
It means "okay, we're done".

187
00:09:39.706 --> 00:09:40.936
There's nothing to do here.

188
00:09:40.936 --> 00:09:42.396
This applet simply won't run.

189
00:09:43.436 --> 00:09:45.286
And there is a workaround.

190
00:09:45.436 --> 00:09:47.996
You can Control click on the
applet, open the long way

191
00:09:47.996 --> 00:09:49.276
and you'll get a
different dialog.

192
00:09:49.276 --> 00:09:50.576
But, for most users, as far

193
00:09:50.576 --> 00:09:52.716
as they're concerned,
it's busted, right?

194
00:09:52.716 --> 00:09:58.076
All they can really do
is throw it in the trash.

195
00:09:58.076 --> 00:10:01.346
So how do I -- how do I make
life easier on my users here

196
00:09:58.076 --> 00:10:01.346
So how do I -- how do I make
life easier on my users here

197
00:10:01.756 --> 00:10:03.926
and not have them think
I'm a complete idiot

198
00:10:04.466 --> 00:10:05.876
for sending them broken applets?

199
00:10:05.966 --> 00:10:09.676
So, in Mountain Lion, we
added an Export command

200
00:10:09.676 --> 00:10:10.446
to Script Editor.

201
00:10:10.446 --> 00:10:11.486
The whole point of Export is

202
00:10:11.486 --> 00:10:13.376
to save the script
for distribution.

203
00:10:13.806 --> 00:10:16.306
In Mountain Lion, the main thing
that it did was it allows you

204
00:10:16.306 --> 00:10:19.806
to save the script as run only,
taking that out of the Save

205
00:10:19.806 --> 00:10:24.236
As dialog because who here has
accidentally saved a run-only

206
00:10:24.236 --> 00:10:26.506
copy of their script
over their real one?

207
00:10:27.836 --> 00:10:29.016
Uh-huh. I thought so.

208
00:10:29.116 --> 00:10:32.746
So Export makes that
a little harder to do.

209
00:10:33.246 --> 00:10:38.766
And now, in Mavericks,
here's run only

210
00:10:38.766 --> 00:10:40.666
but here also is code sign.

211
00:10:41.906 --> 00:10:44.666
So last year we showed you
how to do this in Terminal,

212
00:10:44.666 --> 00:10:45.766
but now it's built right

213
00:10:45.766 --> 00:10:48.346
into Script Editor
and into Automator.

214
00:10:49.066 --> 00:10:51.416
And so, if I pick my --
my developer ID here,

215
00:10:52.206 --> 00:10:55.126
I will save that to the desktop.

216
00:10:58.006 --> 00:10:59.286
Yes, I want to allow this.

217
00:11:00.596 --> 00:11:02.066
So now I have my
code-signed version.

218
00:11:03.206 --> 00:11:07.366
If I up and download
that and run it,

219
00:11:08.066 --> 00:11:09.086
now I get a different dialog.

220
00:11:09.086 --> 00:11:11.476
It says this is downloaded
from the Internet.

221
00:11:11.666 --> 00:11:14.126
Gatekeeper is still not too
sure about this Internet thing.

222
00:11:14.336 --> 00:11:16.306
Kind of new.

223
00:11:16.356 --> 00:11:18.996
But now it's Cancel
and it's Open.

224
00:11:19.366 --> 00:11:24.086
So, if I open, it goes
ahead and run -- and runs.

225
00:11:25.516 --> 00:11:27.836
[ Applause ]

226
00:11:28.336 --> 00:11:31.186
So that is how -- so code
signing will make your

227
00:11:31.186 --> 00:11:31.846
life easier.

228
00:11:31.846 --> 00:11:34.546
Mavericks makes your life
easier code signing your applets

229
00:11:34.546 --> 00:11:35.456
because it's now built right

230
00:11:35.456 --> 00:11:36.786
into the editor you're
already using.

231
00:11:37.206 --> 00:11:40.386
And it makes life easier on your
user because they don't have

232
00:11:40.446 --> 00:11:43.646
to worry about long
hand waves of dealing

233
00:11:43.646 --> 00:11:44.896
with nonsigned applets.

234
00:11:45.476 --> 00:11:47.036
Sal, back to you.

235
00:11:47.736 --> 00:11:48.626
>> Sal Soghoian: Thank you.

236
00:11:49.096 --> 00:11:51.356
So it works with Automator

237
00:11:51.356 --> 00:11:53.626
and AppleScript applets
and droplets.

238
00:11:53.906 --> 00:11:55.096
They're applications.

239
00:11:55.376 --> 00:11:57.196
You have to remember
that, if you're going

240
00:11:57.196 --> 00:12:00.106
to distribute them now that
we have Gatekeeper, it --

241
00:11:57.196 --> 00:12:00.106
to distribute them now that
we have Gatekeeper, it --

242
00:12:00.106 --> 00:12:02.196
its default settings,
you might want

243
00:12:02.196 --> 00:12:03.946
to just quickly do an export.

244
00:12:04.146 --> 00:12:06.356
Code signing will even
save it as run only

245
00:12:06.356 --> 00:12:07.576
if you like to as well.

246
00:12:07.756 --> 00:12:09.456
And this has all
been integrated.

247
00:12:09.656 --> 00:12:11.866
You can see it's a
very simple process.

248
00:12:12.596 --> 00:12:14.036
Take advantage of it.

249
00:12:14.486 --> 00:12:16.556
Next we're going to talk

250
00:12:16.556 --> 00:12:19.356
about extending the
power of AppleScript.

251
00:12:20.336 --> 00:12:24.266
And we're going to be doing that
with something that's brand new,

252
00:12:24.476 --> 00:12:27.876
and it's called AppleScript
libraries.

253
00:12:30.486 --> 00:12:32.566
Now, why libraries?

254
00:12:33.066 --> 00:12:36.066
Well, I assume that
many of you are like me.

255
00:12:36.866 --> 00:12:41.656
You're the kind of person
has hundreds and hundreds

256
00:12:42.336 --> 00:12:47.226
of your favorite routines that
you've written over and over

257
00:12:47.226 --> 00:12:50.906
and over for lots of different
situations and scenarios,

258
00:12:51.516 --> 00:12:54.926
and you want to be able to
use those in multiple scripts.

259
00:12:54.926 --> 00:12:58.616
So I have four or five things if
I have a script that's dealing

260
00:12:58.616 --> 00:13:00.716
with text I'm going
to be pasting these

261
00:12:58.616 --> 00:13:00.716
with text I'm going
to be pasting these

262
00:13:00.716 --> 00:13:03.056
in the bottom part of my script.

263
00:13:04.066 --> 00:13:07.526
Now, if you also are the
type of person that relies

264
00:13:07.526 --> 00:13:09.586
on third-party scripting
additions

265
00:13:09.586 --> 00:13:13.956
to provide a missing command
like especially something

266
00:13:13.956 --> 00:13:17.596
with text handling, you're
going to like libraries.

267
00:13:18.236 --> 00:13:21.936
And if you just want to
simplify your scripts,

268
00:13:22.416 --> 00:13:24.276
you're going to like libraries.

269
00:13:25.286 --> 00:13:29.336
Now, it started for me by having
a routine that I like to use,

270
00:13:29.336 --> 00:13:33.496
and then I started using
it in multiple scripts.

271
00:13:34.156 --> 00:13:36.186
And it was quite useful.

272
00:13:36.186 --> 00:13:38.796
I would just copy this
thing from, like a clipping.

273
00:13:38.796 --> 00:13:39.906
I would paste in.

274
00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:42.436
Then I found another
routine that I used,

275
00:13:42.436 --> 00:13:45.826
and then I would paste that into
some of the scripts that I had.

276
00:13:46.216 --> 00:13:48.806
But then I started changing
some of the routines

277
00:13:48.806 --> 00:13:51.836
and then I added new ones and
then it just became this thing

278
00:13:51.836 --> 00:13:56.186
of I couldn't keep track of all
the different stuff that I had.

279
00:13:57.036 --> 00:14:01.366
So new in Mavericks we're
introducing AppleScript

280
00:13:57.036 --> 00:14:01.366
So new in Mavericks we're
introducing AppleScript

281
00:14:01.366 --> 00:14:04.306
libraries that will
help address this issue.

282
00:14:04.906 --> 00:14:08.016
And what they are is a
new plug-in architecture

283
00:14:08.016 --> 00:14:13.276
for AppleScript that allows you
to create your own libraries

284
00:14:13.726 --> 00:14:19.716
of commands and gives you
quick and easy access to them

285
00:14:19.716 --> 00:14:21.766
without having to go
through a bunch of --

286
00:14:22.296 --> 00:14:24.636
of hoo-ha to get
to your handlers.

287
00:14:25.276 --> 00:14:26.906
Now, they're different

288
00:14:26.906 --> 00:14:29.326
than scripting editions
in a couple ways.

289
00:14:29.436 --> 00:14:31.796
First of all, you can
write them in AppleScript.

290
00:14:32.276 --> 00:14:34.946
You don't have to write
these in C or C++.

291
00:14:34.946 --> 00:14:36.476
You can write them
in AppleScript.

292
00:14:37.126 --> 00:14:42.066
And they're controlled by the
script that's calling them,

293
00:14:42.396 --> 00:14:45.726
so that manages your
script libraries.

294
00:14:46.196 --> 00:14:49.076
It means that the
library is only loaded

295
00:14:49.076 --> 00:14:52.616
and it's only available when
your script tells it to load.

296
00:14:52.666 --> 00:14:55.966
And it helps avoid
terminology conflicts that way.

297
00:14:56.226 --> 00:14:58.206
It helps deal with resources.

298
00:14:58.496 --> 00:15:00.936
And the script library
commands are run

299
00:14:58.496 --> 00:15:00.936
And the script library
commands are run

300
00:15:00.936 --> 00:15:03.656
by the process that's
executing the script.

301
00:15:04.386 --> 00:15:08.006
So it's a lot smoother
to deal with.

302
00:15:08.516 --> 00:15:11.366
In addition, these
libraries can take advantage

303
00:15:11.366 --> 00:15:15.586
of AppleScript Objective-C,
so the wealth

304
00:15:15.586 --> 00:15:20.006
of the Cocoa frameworks
and all of those classes

305
00:15:20.006 --> 00:15:24.336
and methods now come into
play in the libraries

306
00:15:24.336 --> 00:15:25.686
that you write yourself.

307
00:15:25.686 --> 00:15:29.496
You can use some AppleScript
Objective-C and talk

308
00:15:29.576 --> 00:15:34.546
to the NS string class and use
some of its methods as well.

309
00:15:35.656 --> 00:15:40.876
In addition, your libraries can
contain their own terminology.

310
00:15:41.006 --> 00:15:43.786
They can publish
their own terminology.

311
00:15:44.656 --> 00:15:47.746
So you can make custom terms

312
00:15:47.746 --> 00:15:51.026
that represent the
complex handlers

313
00:15:51.026 --> 00:15:52.846
that are parts of your library.

314
00:15:53.316 --> 00:15:54.936
Yes. It's really, really nice.

315
00:15:54.936 --> 00:15:58.366
So, instead of remembering a
handler name, I can just put

316
00:15:58.366 --> 00:16:01.086
in some terminology and
it will work perfectly.

317
00:15:58.366 --> 00:16:01.086
in some terminology and
it will work perfectly.

318
00:16:02.006 --> 00:16:05.536
Now, in support of that, we've
created two new constructs.

319
00:16:06.036 --> 00:16:07.156
The first is something

320
00:16:07.156 --> 00:16:09.926
that we're calling a
script library reference.

321
00:16:10.056 --> 00:16:13.226
And what it does is it
does a couple of functions.

322
00:16:13.226 --> 00:16:16.756
It locates the script
library for you automatically

323
00:16:17.166 --> 00:16:20.166
and prepares it for loading
and use in your script.

324
00:16:20.856 --> 00:16:23.116
The second is something
brand new.

325
00:16:23.116 --> 00:16:27.316
It's called a use clause,
and it is really a command

326
00:16:27.316 --> 00:16:29.266
for importing terminology

327
00:16:29.466 --> 00:16:32.476
and making it globally
available in your script.

328
00:16:33.236 --> 00:16:34.266
Very powerful.

329
00:16:34.566 --> 00:16:36.096
A lot of fun to use.

330
00:16:36.366 --> 00:16:37.596
Let's take a look at this.

331
00:16:38.356 --> 00:16:43.486
So, in its simplest
form, simplest form,

332
00:16:43.486 --> 00:16:48.646
an AppleScript library can
just be in AppleScript routine

333
00:16:48.936 --> 00:16:51.746
that you have like this
simple routine here

334
00:16:51.746 --> 00:16:55.086
for converting the
case of some text

335
00:16:55.086 --> 00:16:56.966
from uppercase to lowercase.

336
00:16:57.466 --> 00:17:01.126
You can have this very
simple AppleScript handler

337
00:16:57.466 --> 00:17:01.126
You can have this very
simple AppleScript handler

338
00:17:01.126 --> 00:17:02.146
that you've created.

339
00:17:02.676 --> 00:17:06.006
You take that, you
place it into a script.

340
00:17:07.185 --> 00:17:08.796
Then you compile it.

341
00:17:09.925 --> 00:17:11.165
You save it.

342
00:17:11.266 --> 00:17:13.886
And, in this case, you just
save it as a script file.

343
00:17:15.455 --> 00:17:18.965
Next, in your home
library folder,

344
00:17:19.705 --> 00:17:23.096
you create a new folder
called script libraries

345
00:17:23.955 --> 00:17:25.906
and then drag your script file,

346
00:17:26.306 --> 00:17:29.206
your new script library,
into that folder.

347
00:17:30.446 --> 00:17:33.216
Now you've installed it
into the script library,

348
00:17:33.216 --> 00:17:34.756
AppleScript library system.

349
00:17:35.016 --> 00:17:36.046
That's all you have to do.

350
00:17:36.046 --> 00:17:42.126
So, to use it, it's just a
matter of typing the word

351
00:17:42.126 --> 00:17:46.156
"script" followed by the
name of your library.

352
00:17:46.496 --> 00:17:49.526
And you don't have to
use .scbt or anything,

353
00:17:49.736 --> 00:17:51.486
just the name of your library.

354
00:17:52.526 --> 00:17:54.636
And, when you compile this,

355
00:17:54.826 --> 00:17:58.376
it becomes a script
library identifier.

356
00:17:58.716 --> 00:18:04.936
That is now a representation
of your script library.

357
00:17:58.716 --> 00:18:04.936
That is now a representation
of your script library.

358
00:18:05.556 --> 00:18:08.926
The AppleScript architecture
automatically located it

359
00:18:08.926 --> 00:18:10.926
in the script libraries folder.

360
00:18:10.926 --> 00:18:13.006
It's prepared it,
ready for load.

361
00:18:13.246 --> 00:18:16.106
And now that it's an identifier,

362
00:18:16.646 --> 00:18:21.346
you can target it using a
tell verb or a tell block

363
00:18:21.346 --> 00:18:24.626
like this example where
I will be calling one

364
00:18:24.626 --> 00:18:26.946
of the subroutines or
one of the handlers

365
00:18:26.946 --> 00:18:30.876
within that library
script, pass it some text --

366
00:18:30.876 --> 00:18:34.916
how now brown cow -- and
use a numeric indicator

367
00:18:34.916 --> 00:18:36.946
to indicate I want uppercase.

368
00:18:37.456 --> 00:18:40.836
So when this gets run,
the library is loaded,

369
00:18:40.836 --> 00:18:42.736
the information is passed,

370
00:18:43.056 --> 00:18:45.576
and the results come back
to you automatically.

371
00:18:46.886 --> 00:18:50.276
Very simple way to
make a library.

372
00:18:50.276 --> 00:18:52.896
Just very functional
but easy to do,

373
00:18:52.896 --> 00:18:55.586
easy to install,
and easy to use.

374
00:18:56.586 --> 00:18:59.706
Now, in its more advanced forms,

375
00:19:00.036 --> 00:19:03.426
a library can have
its own terminology.

376
00:19:03.576 --> 00:19:06.026
And here is the dictionary
window

377
00:19:06.466 --> 00:19:08.936
for an AppleScript library.

378
00:19:09.486 --> 00:19:13.746
It has a single suite, and the
suite is called AppleScript

379
00:19:13.806 --> 00:19:15.006
Text Utilities.

380
00:19:15.416 --> 00:19:20.626
This suite has two commands
in it: one for changing,

381
00:19:20.626 --> 00:19:23.256
transforming text; one
for replacing text.

382
00:19:23.786 --> 00:19:27.866
It has a definition for the
suite and shows the definition

383
00:19:27.866 --> 00:19:30.966
for each one of the
individual commands.

384
00:19:31.606 --> 00:19:34.366
So in an advanced
form of a library,

385
00:19:34.626 --> 00:19:39.426
you can have this
terminology available for you

386
00:19:39.426 --> 00:19:42.906
and for your customers and
for everybody else to use.

387
00:19:43.656 --> 00:19:48.656
So no longer are you calling
a handler name or having

388
00:19:48.656 --> 00:19:50.146
to remember a handler name.

389
00:19:50.486 --> 00:19:55.026
Instead, you can now use
terminology like transform text,

390
00:19:55.246 --> 00:19:58.126
how now brown cow to uppercase.

391
00:19:58.736 --> 00:20:02.016
And this will function
exactly the same way

392
00:19:58.736 --> 00:20:02.016
And this will function
exactly the same way

393
00:20:02.266 --> 00:20:04.156
as a library did before.

394
00:20:04.826 --> 00:20:07.126
Now, that's in the
more advanced format.

395
00:20:07.926 --> 00:20:12.056
So here's an example
script talking

396
00:20:12.056 --> 00:20:14.016
to the Finder application,

397
00:20:14.326 --> 00:20:18.306
and this contains a
tell block addressing an

398
00:20:18.306 --> 00:20:19.956
AppleScript library.

399
00:20:20.586 --> 00:20:22.176
You can see it right
there where it's going

400
00:20:22.176 --> 00:20:28.316
to basically take the name
of some selected folders

401
00:20:28.316 --> 00:20:30.816
in the Finder, and it's
going to iterate all

402
00:20:30.816 --> 00:20:33.716
of these folders getting
their lowercase names

403
00:20:33.716 --> 00:20:35.756
and converting them
to uppercase names.

404
00:20:36.166 --> 00:20:38.506
So that's the purpose
of the script.

405
00:20:39.326 --> 00:20:44.926
Now, you'll notice that, by
having an individual tell block

406
00:20:44.926 --> 00:20:48.666
for every time I want to talk to
this library, in a small script

407
00:20:48.666 --> 00:20:51.416
like that, I can
get away with it.

408
00:20:51.416 --> 00:20:55.516
But, in a larger script where
you repeatedly might go back

409
00:20:55.516 --> 00:20:57.006
and refer to this library,

410
00:20:57.186 --> 00:20:59.046
that's a little clunky
to deal with.

411
00:20:59.926 --> 00:21:03.496
In addition, there's
another issue going on here.

412
00:20:59.926 --> 00:21:03.496
In addition, there's
another issue going on here.

413
00:21:03.566 --> 00:21:06.386
You'll notice that there
is a variable called

414
00:21:06.386 --> 00:21:08.636
"adjusted name" that's
actually going

415
00:21:08.636 --> 00:21:13.206
to store the transformation
result, hold it for a second

416
00:21:13.206 --> 00:21:17.886
because it was within a tell
block, and then use it later

417
00:21:17.886 --> 00:21:21.686
on in the script for the
Finder to assign the name

418
00:21:21.686 --> 00:21:25.416
of the selected item to
that transformed name.

419
00:21:25.416 --> 00:21:27.566
So you're doing this
little dance

420
00:21:27.566 --> 00:21:29.006
because of this tell block.

421
00:21:29.526 --> 00:21:31.936
And, again, this makes
it a little clunkier.

422
00:21:32.146 --> 00:21:36.396
It works, but it's
not smooth syntax.

423
00:21:36.896 --> 00:21:40.256
So we've come up with
something to address this issue.

424
00:21:40.946 --> 00:21:43.256
And I'm just going to make
a little room at the top

425
00:21:43.256 --> 00:21:46.246
of the script, and were going
to insert something new.

426
00:21:46.426 --> 00:21:48.596
It's called a use clause.

427
00:21:49.266 --> 00:21:52.646
And this use clause is
an importing command

428
00:21:53.236 --> 00:21:56.466
that says "Use this library."

429
00:21:56.466 --> 00:21:58.766
There's a script
library identifier.

430
00:21:59.116 --> 00:22:03.136
And that means it will take it,
load it, and make its resources

431
00:21:59.116 --> 00:22:03.136
And that means it will take it,
load it, and make its resources

432
00:22:03.136 --> 00:22:06.856
and handlers available
for the script globally.

433
00:22:07.326 --> 00:22:10.876
So, because I have a use
clause here, I don't need

434
00:22:10.876 --> 00:22:16.066
to have the tell block around my
statement that calls my library.

435
00:22:16.066 --> 00:22:17.206
I can remove that.

436
00:22:17.796 --> 00:22:21.336
And I can also deal with
that little back and forth

437
00:22:21.336 --> 00:22:24.786
about having you create a
variable to store the contents

438
00:22:24.786 --> 00:22:28.546
of the command and then reapply
it and instead put everything

439
00:22:28.546 --> 00:22:32.386
on one line so that the
Finder can say "Set the name

440
00:22:32.386 --> 00:22:36.166
of the selected file to the
results of this transformation."

441
00:22:36.576 --> 00:22:40.666
And then it just becomes one
seamless, transparent line.

442
00:22:41.546 --> 00:22:45.666
So we can go from
this little clunkiness

443
00:22:46.016 --> 00:22:51.496
to a very smooth example with
this new use clause ability.

444
00:22:51.956 --> 00:22:55.306
And it works the same
way as anything else.

445
00:22:55.616 --> 00:22:57.186
It works totally smooth.

446
00:22:57.186 --> 00:22:58.276
It's transparent.

447
00:22:59.246 --> 00:23:02.166
Now, let's talk about the
use clause for just a second.

448
00:22:59.246 --> 00:23:02.166
Now, let's talk about the
use clause for just a second.

449
00:23:02.586 --> 00:23:06.256
It's about importing
terminology, and it allows you

450
00:23:06.306 --> 00:23:08.186
to import the terminology

451
00:23:08.186 --> 00:23:11.606
of script libraries
and applications.

452
00:23:12.496 --> 00:23:14.996
So the importing commands,

453
00:23:14.996 --> 00:23:18.956
when you import an
applications terminology

454
00:23:18.956 --> 00:23:20.696
or a script libraries
terminology,

455
00:23:21.066 --> 00:23:23.636
they are available
globally through the script.

456
00:23:23.636 --> 00:23:25.366
You no longer have to address

457
00:23:25.366 --> 00:23:27.276
that application
or that library.

458
00:23:27.526 --> 00:23:28.856
It's not necessary.

459
00:23:29.716 --> 00:23:36.536
And you can also use this use
-- use clause to specify the use

460
00:23:36.576 --> 00:23:39.176
of a particular version
of AppleScript

461
00:23:39.456 --> 00:23:41.756
or a particular version
of an application

462
00:23:41.756 --> 00:23:45.466
or even a particular
version of a script library.

463
00:23:45.886 --> 00:23:48.086
And it sure does make --

464
00:23:48.086 --> 00:23:51.186
streamline the script
syntax that you have.

465
00:23:51.366 --> 00:23:55.816
It makes things easier to
see, conceive, and use.

466
00:23:56.496 --> 00:24:00.636
So here to show you the
use clause is my friend,

467
00:23:56.496 --> 00:24:00.636
So here to show you the
use clause is my friend,

468
00:24:00.636 --> 00:24:01.246
Chris Nebel.

469
00:24:02.216 --> 00:24:02.536
>> Chris Nebel: Okay.

470
00:24:02.856 --> 00:24:05.116
I personally am really
excited about this feature.

471
00:24:05.116 --> 00:24:07.236
This is, like, my favorite
AppleScript feature

472
00:24:07.236 --> 00:24:08.186
in a long time.

473
00:24:08.186 --> 00:24:09.526
It's one of those ones

474
00:24:09.526 --> 00:24:11.806
that makes you wonder why
it didn't always work this

475
00:24:11.806 --> 00:24:12.056
way [laughter].

476
00:24:13.666 --> 00:24:17.666
So let's see how it
affects an actual script.

477
00:24:17.666 --> 00:24:22.686
So I am the team mom --
that's the actual job title --

478
00:24:22.996 --> 00:24:24.566
for my neighborhood soccer team.

479
00:24:24.696 --> 00:24:27.126
Basically, it's handle all
the administrative stuff

480
00:24:27.126 --> 00:24:29.666
so the coach doesn't have to.

481
00:24:29.826 --> 00:24:32.906
And part of the job is
forwarding email around.

482
00:24:33.226 --> 00:24:36.706
Someone -- someone on the
team sends me an email.

483
00:24:36.706 --> 00:24:38.286
I have to send it out to
the rest of the group.

484
00:24:38.746 --> 00:24:40.246
But the rules are
a little tricky.

485
00:24:40.506 --> 00:24:43.046
I want to send it to everyone
else in the group except

486
00:24:43.046 --> 00:24:44.136
for the original sender.

487
00:24:44.136 --> 00:24:46.476
Them, I want to Cc.

488
00:24:46.476 --> 00:24:50.176
And mail can almost
do this but not quite.

489
00:24:50.176 --> 00:24:54.206
If you put an address book or
contacts group in the To field,

490
00:24:54.206 --> 00:24:56.056
it can expand it out
to all the people.

491
00:24:56.386 --> 00:24:58.436
But then it's up to me to
actually find the right person

492
00:24:58.436 --> 00:24:59.836
and pull them over
to the Cc group.

493
00:24:59.836 --> 00:25:02.066
It gets a bit out of -- it
gets a bit messy after a while,

494
00:24:59.836 --> 00:25:02.066
It gets a bit out of -- it
gets a bit messy after a while,

495
00:25:02.066 --> 00:25:03.536
especially when you have
to do ten of these a day.

496
00:25:04.536 --> 00:25:07.306
So -- but, automation, one
of the things it's for is

497
00:25:07.466 --> 00:25:09.956
for filling in the gaps when the
system almost does what you want

498
00:25:10.186 --> 00:25:10.796
but not quite.

499
00:25:10.796 --> 00:25:15.256
So here's the script that I
wrote to handle this for me.

500
00:25:15.836 --> 00:25:19.736
So we tell application mail get
the current selected message;

501
00:25:21.006 --> 00:25:22.066
forward that message.

502
00:25:22.066 --> 00:25:25.776
It creates a new forwarding
message ready to be filled in.

503
00:25:25.976 --> 00:25:28.136
And then we flip
over to Contacts.

504
00:25:28.336 --> 00:25:30.526
I have a group defined
Neighborhood Team so --

505
00:25:30.526 --> 00:25:34.306
with every person in that group,
filled out an email address

506
00:25:34.306 --> 00:25:37.396
for them, and then we flip
back to application mail.

507
00:25:38.716 --> 00:25:43.386
And, if the sender of the
original message contains

508
00:25:43.386 --> 00:25:46.606
that name, then we want to
add them as a Cc recipient;

509
00:25:47.056 --> 00:25:49.076
otherwise, it's a To recipient.

510
00:25:50.746 --> 00:25:52.306
And this works well enough.

511
00:25:52.466 --> 00:25:53.716
Let's see it in action.

512
00:25:54.326 --> 00:25:59.906
And the message was
originally from John.

513
00:25:59.906 --> 00:26:00.816
He's been Cc'd.

514
00:25:59.906 --> 00:26:00.816
He's been Cc'd.

515
00:26:00.996 --> 00:26:02.686
Everyone else, it goes "To."

516
00:26:03.296 --> 00:26:07.466
So, obviously, the script works.

517
00:26:07.466 --> 00:26:13.106
But you notice the sort
of back and forth tell --

518
00:26:13.106 --> 00:26:17.206
tell this, tell this, tell
that, tell this, tell that.

519
00:26:17.646 --> 00:26:20.196
And that's very typical of
any script when you're talking

520
00:26:20.196 --> 00:26:21.416
to more than one application.

521
00:26:21.416 --> 00:26:23.246
You have to flip back and
forth between them a lot.

522
00:26:24.446 --> 00:26:27.606
So wouldn't it be nice if the --

523
00:26:27.606 --> 00:26:28.796
if AppleScript could figure

524
00:26:28.796 --> 00:26:31.136
out which application you're
actually talking to just

525
00:26:31.136 --> 00:26:32.436
by the terms that you're using.

526
00:26:32.876 --> 00:26:34.476
Well, that's pretty
much what use does.

527
00:26:34.476 --> 00:26:36.256
Let's look at how
the script changes.

528
00:26:39.076 --> 00:26:42.836
So two use statements
at the top.

529
00:26:43.166 --> 00:26:44.716
The first one is
application mail,

530
00:26:45.056 --> 00:26:47.256
and I'm also defining
a shorthand name

531
00:26:47.256 --> 00:26:48.616
for it that I can use later.

532
00:26:48.746 --> 00:26:51.436
It's essentially a property
whose value is application mail.

533
00:26:51.546 --> 00:26:54.136
I'm also going to use
application contacts.

534
00:26:55.236 --> 00:26:56.646
The first line is
pretty much the same.

535
00:26:56.886 --> 00:26:58.546
Get the selection of mail.

536
00:26:58.546 --> 00:27:00.396
I have to specify that
it's mail selection

537
00:26:58.546 --> 00:27:00.396
I have to specify that
it's mail selection

538
00:27:00.396 --> 00:27:02.096
because contacts
has a selection to.

539
00:27:02.096 --> 00:27:03.476
So got to be explicit there.

540
00:27:04.026 --> 00:27:07.056
But then we can forward
the message.

541
00:27:07.056 --> 00:27:08.476
And notice there's
no tell block here.

542
00:27:08.776 --> 00:27:13.206
The compiler knows that,
forward, mail is the only thing

543
00:27:13.206 --> 00:27:16.096
that defined forward; so
it will send that to mail.

544
00:27:16.616 --> 00:27:20.246
And then we repeat with
every person in a group.

545
00:27:20.676 --> 00:27:22.566
No tell blocks again
because it knows that person

546
00:27:22.566 --> 00:27:24.746
in group are defined by
contacts and not by mail.

547
00:27:25.306 --> 00:27:29.706
You're building up the
mail address if the sender

548
00:27:29.706 --> 00:27:31.976
of the original message were
actually getting this straight

549
00:27:31.976 --> 00:27:34.036
from mail instead
of prefetching it,

550
00:27:34.856 --> 00:27:37.816
and this actually
comes from contacts.

551
00:27:37.816 --> 00:27:42.946
We're mixing two applications
in the same statement making you

552
00:27:42.946 --> 00:27:44.556
to Cc or To recipient.

553
00:27:44.556 --> 00:27:46.706
And, again, there's no
tell blocks anywhere here.

554
00:27:47.236 --> 00:27:52.596
And, yet, it works
exactly the same.

555
00:27:53.516 --> 00:27:58.546
[ Pause ]

556
00:27:59.046 --> 00:28:02.466
So, essentially, what use
does is it lets you get rid

557
00:27:59.046 --> 00:28:02.466
So, essentially, what use
does is it lets you get rid

558
00:28:02.466 --> 00:28:04.996
of all the bookkeeping that
the computer really ought

559
00:28:04.996 --> 00:28:06.276
to be able to do for you.

560
00:28:06.846 --> 00:28:10.266
Notice that this script, this
new script, is much narrower

561
00:28:10.836 --> 00:28:11.686
than the original one.

562
00:28:12.916 --> 00:28:14.596
It gets rid of all
the tell blocks

563
00:28:14.806 --> 00:28:18.746
so you can concentrate just
on your application logic

564
00:28:18.906 --> 00:28:21.026
and not have to worry
so much about exactly

565
00:28:21.066 --> 00:28:22.806
which application
you're telling to do what

566
00:28:23.186 --> 00:28:25.826
because AppleScript should
be able to do that for you.

567
00:28:26.016 --> 00:28:28.426
Now it can.

568
00:28:29.516 --> 00:28:34.656
[ Applause ]

569
00:28:35.156 --> 00:28:35.396
>> Sal Soghoian: Yeah.

570
00:28:35.396 --> 00:28:38.136
It's going to take me
a while to wrap my head

571
00:28:38.136 --> 00:28:41.816
around all the different places
I can use the use clause,

572
00:28:42.436 --> 00:28:45.886
but I'm very excited by
it because I've been able

573
00:28:45.886 --> 00:28:48.026
to do some really
interesting things

574
00:28:48.026 --> 00:28:50.076
in a single line statement

575
00:28:50.306 --> 00:28:53.246
that it would usually
take me multiple lines

576
00:28:53.246 --> 00:28:55.026
and multiple tell blocks to do.

577
00:28:55.516 --> 00:28:58.456
It's a very powerful
construct and especially

578
00:28:58.456 --> 00:28:59.846
when it's used with libraries.

579
00:29:00.036 --> 00:29:00.666
It's great.

580
00:29:01.786 --> 00:29:05.536
So, AppleScript libraries, they
are a new plug-in architecture

581
00:29:05.536 --> 00:29:08.626
that allows you to get at
your favorite handlers.

582
00:29:08.866 --> 00:29:10.606
You can create these yourself.

583
00:29:11.166 --> 00:29:13.376
They're different than
scripting additions

584
00:29:13.476 --> 00:29:15.466
because you can write
them in AppleScript

585
00:29:16.576 --> 00:29:19.436
and that the script
manages their use

586
00:29:19.526 --> 00:29:22.166
and use of resources as well.

587
00:29:22.756 --> 00:29:25.896
They can also have access
to AppleScript Objective-C,

588
00:29:25.896 --> 00:29:29.566
so that means the
world of Cocoa, methods

589
00:29:29.746 --> 00:29:31.886
and classes are at
your disposal.

590
00:29:32.686 --> 00:29:36.676
And you can publish your own
terminology for them as well.

591
00:29:36.986 --> 00:29:41.076
In support, we've added the new
script library reference and,

592
00:29:41.076 --> 00:29:44.276
as we just demonstrated,
the new use clause

593
00:29:44.486 --> 00:29:47.076
to help automatically
find, locate,

594
00:29:47.076 --> 00:29:49.256
and load these things
globally for you.

595
00:29:50.216 --> 00:29:55.406
Now, we have a session this
afternoon on just libraries

596
00:29:55.406 --> 00:29:59.026
where we get into
detail and show you how

597
00:29:59.026 --> 00:30:03.416
to construct a library, not
only a simple one but one

598
00:29:59.026 --> 00:30:03.416
to construct a library, not
only a simple one but one

599
00:30:03.416 --> 00:30:07.786
in AppleScript Objective-C, one
that actually has a terminology.

600
00:30:07.786 --> 00:30:10.816
And, for the first time
anywhere in the world,

601
00:30:11.046 --> 00:30:16.116
we will show you how to write
a scripting dictionary file

602
00:30:16.276 --> 00:30:17.316
or an sdef [laughter].

603
00:30:19.516 --> 00:30:22.556
[ Applause ]

604
00:30:23.056 --> 00:30:24.066
It is sick, sick, sick.

605
00:30:24.426 --> 00:30:25.416
You can't miss it.

606
00:30:25.806 --> 00:30:27.536
So that's this afternoon.

607
00:30:27.536 --> 00:30:29.116
It's right in this same room.

608
00:30:29.116 --> 00:30:32.146
It session 416 at 3:15 pm.

609
00:30:32.456 --> 00:30:35.916
If this is interesting you, I
suggest please come to this.

610
00:30:35.916 --> 00:30:38.366
When you're done, you'll
really understand them

611
00:30:38.556 --> 00:30:40.396
and be able to start
using these.

612
00:30:40.396 --> 00:30:41.446
They're very powerful.

613
00:30:42.876 --> 00:30:45.376
Next we're going to talk
about notifications.

614
00:30:45.756 --> 00:30:47.776
Informing the user
of what's going on.

615
00:30:48.266 --> 00:30:50.806
So the other day I
was reading this blog

616
00:30:50.806 --> 00:30:53.416
about how they got
it right in OS X

617
00:30:53.416 --> 00:30:54.976
with the Notification Center.

618
00:30:54.976 --> 00:30:56.666
And the guy says, "Yeah, man.

619
00:30:56.916 --> 00:31:00.536
You know, they -- they're
located in a central location.

620
00:30:56.916 --> 00:31:00.536
You know, they -- they're
located in a central location.

621
00:31:00.536 --> 00:31:03.416
They're organized
by application.

622
00:31:03.816 --> 00:31:06.406
And they disappear quickly

623
00:31:06.406 --> 00:31:09.856
so that there is no
clutter on your screen.

624
00:31:10.046 --> 00:31:12.196
It's really nice
that they're there.

625
00:31:12.436 --> 00:31:16.406
And it can even provide a
mechanism for you to respond.

626
00:31:16.556 --> 00:31:18.566
And, in the new version
that you've seen,

627
00:31:18.986 --> 00:31:21.706
you can even have replies
and stuff like that.

628
00:31:22.346 --> 00:31:24.806
And, you know, they're
designed not

629
00:31:24.806 --> 00:31:27.046
to annoy you or get in the way.

630
00:31:27.946 --> 00:31:31.186
[Laughter] And they should
never, ever leap, jump,

631
00:31:31.186 --> 00:31:34.846
or hop and definitely
not bounce."

632
00:31:35.456 --> 00:31:39.806
So I'm showing you this
because, for many, many years,

633
00:31:39.806 --> 00:31:45.136
this is the way that scripts
tried to notify you until now.

634
00:31:45.976 --> 00:31:48.806
So we've added notifications
support

635
00:31:48.806 --> 00:31:50.786
in Automator and AppleScript.

636
00:31:51.256 --> 00:31:53.316
And we've integrated
it [applause] -- yes.

637
00:31:55.706 --> 00:32:00.026
And we've integrated it in
both applications and --

638
00:31:55.706 --> 00:32:00.026
And we've integrated it in
both applications and --

639
00:32:00.476 --> 00:32:04.916
so that there's no more need
for these mobile dialogs

640
00:32:04.916 --> 00:32:06.656
that just kind of hang around,

641
00:32:06.926 --> 00:32:09.126
and you can now create
your automations

642
00:32:09.126 --> 00:32:11.496
that are 100 percent
bounce-free [laughter].

643
00:32:13.486 --> 00:32:15.406
So let's take a look
at how this works.

644
00:32:15.876 --> 00:32:19.336
There's a Notifications Control
-- System Preference pane,

645
00:32:19.336 --> 00:32:20.896
right, in the Master
Preference pane.

646
00:32:20.896 --> 00:32:25.466
If you open that in Mavericks,
you'll see that your favorite,

647
00:32:25.466 --> 00:32:30.666
you know, automation applets
and droplets appear in the list

648
00:32:30.666 --> 00:32:33.176
of applications like
everything else.

649
00:32:33.266 --> 00:32:36.666
And you can select them
and set their preferences.

650
00:32:36.666 --> 00:32:40.406
For example, I can select my
photo droplet, and I can choose

651
00:32:40.466 --> 00:32:42.676
that it will display
as an alert.

652
00:32:43.096 --> 00:32:45.546
Or I can even say, No; I
don't want any display.

653
00:32:45.546 --> 00:32:46.786
Just use the sound.

654
00:32:47.476 --> 00:32:50.246
Or, if I have something
that I use quite a lot

655
00:32:50.736 --> 00:32:53.036
and doesn't require
a notification,

656
00:32:53.276 --> 00:32:55.176
then I can just turn
it off and take it

657
00:32:55.176 --> 00:32:59.036
out of the Notification system
by just clicking that checkbox.

658
00:32:59.826 --> 00:33:04.626
So, when it comes to Automator,
many people don't know that,

659
00:32:59.826 --> 00:33:04.626
So, when it comes to Automator,
many people don't know that,

660
00:33:04.626 --> 00:33:08.616
when you run an Automator
workflow or applet,

661
00:33:09.146 --> 00:33:11.036
it does provide some feedback.

662
00:33:11.366 --> 00:33:14.096
And you'll notice
at the very top

663
00:33:14.246 --> 00:33:16.856
of your menu bar there's a gear.

664
00:33:17.256 --> 00:33:20.736
And, if you've ever seen that
or even caught your eye with it,

665
00:33:20.876 --> 00:33:25.166
if you click on that, it will
show you every workflow that's

666
00:33:25.166 --> 00:33:27.276
running and generally
give you an idea

667
00:33:27.276 --> 00:33:29.096
about where the workflow is.

668
00:33:29.516 --> 00:33:31.886
But you have to hold
the cursor down.

669
00:33:32.166 --> 00:33:34.756
And, if you're still holding,
you might get this notice

670
00:33:34.756 --> 00:33:36.326
that says the workflow ended.

671
00:33:37.266 --> 00:33:41.026
But most people don't know
about that and so, generally,

672
00:33:41.026 --> 00:33:43.346
the way that you know
that a workflow is --

673
00:33:43.756 --> 00:33:45.636
is finished is nothing.

674
00:33:45.636 --> 00:33:47.566
There's nothing there
to show you.

675
00:33:48.476 --> 00:33:52.246
Now, with the Automator
in Mavericks,

676
00:33:52.316 --> 00:33:55.376
we've introduced a new
notification action,

677
00:33:56.156 --> 00:33:58.976
and this will cause a
notification to occur.

678
00:33:59.616 --> 00:34:02.896
And you can insert
it more than once

679
00:33:59.616 --> 00:34:02.896
And you can insert
it more than once

680
00:34:02.896 --> 00:34:04.326
in your workflow if you want.

681
00:34:04.326 --> 00:34:05.326
You could put it into the start.

682
00:34:05.326 --> 00:34:07.476
You could put it in key
points in the workflow.

683
00:34:07.696 --> 00:34:09.136
You could just put
it at the end.

684
00:34:09.136 --> 00:34:10.606
Whatever works for you.

685
00:34:11.426 --> 00:34:14.906
And, in addition, it provides
various options for which one

686
00:34:14.906 --> 00:34:16.596
of the fields you want to do,

687
00:34:16.596 --> 00:34:20.326
and it also supports Automator
variables, workflow variables.

688
00:34:20.706 --> 00:34:22.976
So we can have dynamic
information

689
00:34:22.976 --> 00:34:26.646
in that dialog related to
the workflow that was run.

690
00:34:28.275 --> 00:34:32.446
Now, why would you need this
kind of thing in a workflow?

691
00:34:32.536 --> 00:34:36.266
Well, here's a workflow that
I use myself for home movies,

692
00:34:36.266 --> 00:34:38.396
and it's a video
compressing workflow.

693
00:34:38.646 --> 00:34:43.456
Anytime I shoot a bunch of
stuff on my iPhone or a camera,

694
00:34:44.065 --> 00:34:47.025
I take the raw files and I
run it through this droplet.

695
00:34:47.025 --> 00:34:48.786
And let me just walk you
through it real quick.

696
00:34:49.136 --> 00:34:51.906
So it's an applet,
so you can see

697
00:34:51.906 --> 00:34:55.076
at the top it says it receives
whatever you drop onto it.

698
00:34:55.426 --> 00:34:58.176
And then the first
action, I have a find --

699
00:34:58.236 --> 00:35:01.736
filter finder items, so it
looks just for movie files.

700
00:34:58.236 --> 00:35:01.736
filter finder items, so it
looks just for movie files.

701
00:35:01.736 --> 00:35:04.096
In case something else
gets accidentally dropped

702
00:35:04.096 --> 00:35:05.306
on it, it ignores it.

703
00:35:05.906 --> 00:35:10.086
Then, the next action is
creating a workflow variable

704
00:35:10.086 --> 00:35:14.256
that stores the references
to the raw movie files.

705
00:35:14.776 --> 00:35:18.396
Then I proceed to do the first
encoding at a lower thing

706
00:35:18.396 --> 00:35:21.836
of 480p to a certain
location on my drive.

707
00:35:22.796 --> 00:35:28.046
Next, I append a -480p
to the end of the name

708
00:35:28.046 --> 00:35:30.856
of all the created
video files so I know

709
00:35:30.856 --> 00:35:32.716
which ones are the
lower resolution.

710
00:35:33.606 --> 00:35:35.376
Then I use a workflow variable.

711
00:35:35.376 --> 00:35:37.466
I call back that
workflow variable.

712
00:35:37.466 --> 00:35:41.046
I get the original list
of source references.

713
00:35:41.396 --> 00:35:47.176
I perform another encoding pass
using 720p or 1080p depending

714
00:35:47.176 --> 00:35:50.316
on where I'm going to,
to a certain location.

715
00:35:50.726 --> 00:35:53.486
And then again I append
to the end of the name.

716
00:35:54.066 --> 00:35:58.006
So this workflow can take
quite a while to run.

717
00:35:58.006 --> 00:36:02.586
If you drag four or five
10GB files onto this,

718
00:35:58.006 --> 00:36:02.586
If you drag four or five
10GB files onto this,

719
00:36:02.806 --> 00:36:06.656
it can go on for quite a while,
and you have no idea of knowing

720
00:36:06.656 --> 00:36:08.506
where you are in this process.

721
00:36:08.556 --> 00:36:11.646
So this is an example of a
workflow that you would want

722
00:36:11.646 --> 00:36:13.246
to add a notification to.

723
00:36:13.826 --> 00:36:15.536
And to do that it's pretty easy.

724
00:36:15.536 --> 00:36:17.666
You just open up
your library view.

725
00:36:17.956 --> 00:36:20.966
You search in the Search
field for notification.

726
00:36:21.386 --> 00:36:23.876
And you'll see that
it appears in the list

727
00:36:23.876 --> 00:36:26.066
of available Automator actions.

728
00:36:26.326 --> 00:36:28.326
Hit the Return key;
it becomes selected.

729
00:36:28.326 --> 00:36:30.736
You can see the display
of information

730
00:36:30.736 --> 00:36:32.706
about the new notification
action.

731
00:36:32.996 --> 00:36:36.456
Hit the Return key again and it
will automatically inserted it

732
00:36:36.456 --> 00:36:38.286
into the bottom of my workflow.

733
00:36:38.696 --> 00:36:40.576
Then it's just a
matter of me filling

734
00:36:40.576 --> 00:36:43.676
out the fields the
way I want, saving it.

735
00:36:44.056 --> 00:36:47.746
So now I drag my video
file on top of that.

736
00:36:47.746 --> 00:36:51.806
And I hit the gear, but
after a period of time,

737
00:36:52.556 --> 00:36:55.386
the first encoding thing
appears on my desktop.

738
00:36:55.806 --> 00:36:57.666
Then some more time goes by,

739
00:36:58.156 --> 00:37:01.176
and the second encoded
file appears along

740
00:36:58.156 --> 00:37:01.176
and the second encoded
file appears along

741
00:37:01.176 --> 00:37:02.536
with a notification.

742
00:37:02.956 --> 00:37:05.676
So now I know what's
been processed.

743
00:37:05.676 --> 00:37:09.426
If I come back from eating my
doughnut or lunch, whatever,

744
00:37:09.656 --> 00:37:12.116
and I just look at the
machine, I can say, "Oh, great.

745
00:37:12.116 --> 00:37:13.406
The encoding went fine.

746
00:37:13.636 --> 00:37:15.966
Okay. I'm ready to do the
next batch or something."

747
00:37:16.426 --> 00:37:19.646
And because the parameters
are settable

748
00:37:19.646 --> 00:37:22.806
in the System Preference
pane, I can choose to have

749
00:37:22.806 --> 00:37:27.386
that be an alert that demands
that I close that alert so just

750
00:37:27.386 --> 00:37:29.026
as a confirmation as well.

751
00:37:30.166 --> 00:37:34.546
Now, for AppleScript, what we
did is we added a new command

752
00:37:34.546 --> 00:37:36.996
that's part of the
standard editions,

753
00:37:37.386 --> 00:37:40.586
and it's called Display
Notification, of course.

754
00:37:41.246 --> 00:37:43.116
And here's the verb.

755
00:37:43.386 --> 00:37:46.336
There's an optional
parameter with title.

756
00:37:46.336 --> 00:37:51.206
There's another optional
parameter here for subtitle.

757
00:37:51.626 --> 00:37:54.216
And you can put the
name of the sound file

758
00:37:54.216 --> 00:37:55.676
that you want to have play.

759
00:37:55.776 --> 00:37:58.166
Now, all those are
optional parameters,

760
00:37:58.166 --> 00:37:59.706
but you have to use one of them.

761
00:38:00.286 --> 00:38:02.656
And it creates a notification.

762
00:38:03.356 --> 00:38:06.316
So, in that example
I sent to Trudy,

763
00:38:06.576 --> 00:38:09.846
this is basically
the repeat routine.

764
00:38:10.106 --> 00:38:13.056
I would just open some
space here after the repeat,

765
00:38:13.336 --> 00:38:16.956
insert that into there so now
there's display notification.

766
00:38:17.306 --> 00:38:21.566
And I can add custom data
like the number of items

767
00:38:21.566 --> 00:38:25.216
that were processed into
the final message so that,

768
00:38:25.216 --> 00:38:27.206
when I drag a bunch of images

769
00:38:27.206 --> 00:38:30.696
onto the photo droplet,
it processes.

770
00:38:30.786 --> 00:38:33.906
And, then, after a while, it
will display the notification

771
00:38:33.906 --> 00:38:35.356
with the custom information.

772
00:38:35.836 --> 00:38:37.356
It's that simple to use.

773
00:38:37.806 --> 00:38:40.436
So here to show you
notifications

774
00:38:40.436 --> 00:38:42.216
in action is Chris Nebel.

775
00:38:42.476 --> 00:38:42.816
Thank you.

776
00:38:43.436 --> 00:38:43.976
>> Chris Nebel: Thank you, Sal.

777
00:38:44.516 --> 00:38:47.756
[ Applause ]

778
00:38:48.256 --> 00:38:51.426
Okay. So I've got Sal's
encoding workflow here.

779
00:38:51.736 --> 00:38:52.986
Let me get that started.

780
00:38:54.006 --> 00:38:59.246
And, like he said, you
can see that it's running

781
00:38:59.296 --> 00:39:00.546
from the spinning gear menu.

782
00:38:59.296 --> 00:39:00.546
from the spinning gear menu.

783
00:39:00.606 --> 00:39:04.706
But, when it's done, all you
get is just the gear disappears.

784
00:39:04.706 --> 00:39:06.506
You'd like some better
notification of this.

785
00:39:07.046 --> 00:39:10.626
And in the past you'd use
a modal dialog to do this,

786
00:39:10.626 --> 00:39:12.746
but that's really the
wrong interaction method

787
00:39:13.106 --> 00:39:15.826
because a modal dialog
is an alert.

788
00:39:16.056 --> 00:39:18.436
It is saying, "Oh, oh, here.

789
00:39:18.616 --> 00:39:19.256
Sir, sir, sir.

790
00:39:19.306 --> 00:39:20.146
You've got to see this.

791
00:39:20.226 --> 00:39:21.946
You've got to do
something about this.

792
00:39:22.096 --> 00:39:22.776
It's right here.

793
00:39:23.176 --> 00:39:26.466
Are you even paying
attention to this?"

794
00:39:27.956 --> 00:39:31.296
Whereas a notification
is much more passive.

795
00:39:31.826 --> 00:39:34.096
It says, "Oh, hi.

796
00:39:34.166 --> 00:39:38.516
So, yeah. This thing
happened and, yeah.

797
00:39:38.516 --> 00:39:40.426
If you want I can hook you
up with, you know, a guy.

798
00:39:40.856 --> 00:39:43.476
But, you know, if
you don't, it's cool.

799
00:39:44.906 --> 00:39:46.816
See you [laughter]."

800
00:39:47.706 --> 00:39:49.716
And that's what we just got

801
00:39:49.836 --> 00:39:51.526
if you weren't paying
attention as it flowed by.

802
00:39:52.416 --> 00:39:53.756
Our notification showed up and,

803
00:39:53.756 --> 00:39:56.396
if we look in Notification
Center, it's still there

804
00:39:56.436 --> 00:39:58.236
if we happen to be away at
a coffee break or something.

805
00:39:59.386 --> 00:40:01.236
So let's see how we did that.

806
00:39:59.386 --> 00:40:01.236
So let's see how we did that.

807
00:40:01.666 --> 00:40:05.076
I have it open in
Automator over here.

808
00:40:05.786 --> 00:40:09.556
So the basic workflow Sal
explained to you already,

809
00:40:09.746 --> 00:40:14.136
filter out the movies, encode
them, encode them, add the name,

810
00:40:14.136 --> 00:40:15.536
encode then again, add
the different name.

811
00:40:15.896 --> 00:40:19.146
And, at the end, we have display
notification, finished encoding.

812
00:40:19.936 --> 00:40:22.346
So this is nice, but we
can do a little better.

813
00:40:22.846 --> 00:40:24.386
We'd like to get a notification

814
00:40:24.386 --> 00:40:28.046
about what items
just got encoded

815
00:40:28.506 --> 00:40:31.166
because we might have several
of these in flight at once.

816
00:40:32.986 --> 00:40:36.556
Now, we happen to already
have the input file stored

817
00:40:36.556 --> 00:40:37.236
in a variable.

818
00:40:37.236 --> 00:40:39.646
We had to save them
because we were going to --

819
00:40:39.646 --> 00:40:43.216
we have to feed them into two
different encode media actions.

820
00:40:44.116 --> 00:40:47.706
So we can just take
that variable and put it

821
00:40:47.706 --> 00:40:50.716
into the message here because
all these fields support --

822
00:40:50.716 --> 00:40:51.946
support variables.

823
00:40:53.506 --> 00:40:54.056
Save that.

824
00:40:55.466 --> 00:40:57.746
And now, if we do
our workflow again --

825
00:40:57.746 --> 00:40:59.266
I'm using a shorter
movie this time

826
00:40:59.656 --> 00:41:01.086
so it won't take quite as long.

827
00:40:59.656 --> 00:41:01.086
so it won't take quite as long.

828
00:41:01.306 --> 00:41:02.496
There's one file;
there's the next

829
00:41:03.136 --> 00:41:07.576
and says finished
encoding, menomena.

830
00:41:08.516 --> 00:41:13.546
[ Pause ]

831
00:41:14.046 --> 00:41:16.646
So let's try something now
a little more complicated

832
00:41:16.646 --> 00:41:17.926
and a lot more geeky.

833
00:41:21.206 --> 00:41:22.986
So there are lots
of system services,

834
00:41:22.986 --> 00:41:24.316
low-level system services

835
00:41:24.316 --> 00:41:28.576
that tell you what they're doing
simply by writing out to a file.

836
00:41:28.576 --> 00:41:29.896
They write out to a system log.

837
00:41:30.636 --> 00:41:33.776
And, you know, that's
okay as far as it goes.

838
00:41:33.906 --> 00:41:35.616
But, you know, here's
an example.

839
00:41:35.766 --> 00:41:39.306
I have a machine that
other people log into.

840
00:41:39.376 --> 00:41:40.726
And, you know, they
are nice enough folks,

841
00:41:40.726 --> 00:41:43.836
but they get a little, shall
we say, overenthusiastic

842
00:41:43.836 --> 00:41:48.176
about using Pseudo, and I
like to keep an eye on them.

843
00:41:48.976 --> 00:41:52.526
Now, Pseudo is one of
the system services.

844
00:41:52.526 --> 00:41:53.496
It writes into a log.

845
00:41:53.596 --> 00:41:56.636
So anytime something
goes on, you know,

846
00:41:56.636 --> 00:41:58.426
we can keep an eye
on that using Syslog.

847
00:41:58.926 --> 00:42:01.286
So this just writes

848
00:41:58.926 --> 00:42:01.286
So this just writes

849
00:42:01.286 --> 00:42:04.936
out a message anytime
Pseudo logs a message.

850
00:42:06.316 --> 00:42:10.096
And I'm going to pipe this
through sed to clean it

851
00:42:10.096 --> 00:42:13.176
up a little bit so I just
get a simplified version.

852
00:42:13.826 --> 00:42:19.116
And, if I come over here
and say Pseudo-something,

853
00:42:24.916 --> 00:42:26.356
there's my message popping out.

854
00:42:27.206 --> 00:42:29.166
So this is nice as
far as it goes.

855
00:42:29.266 --> 00:42:30.766
But, you know, I've got lots

856
00:42:30.766 --> 00:42:32.716
of Terminal windows
blabbing text at me all day.

857
00:42:32.716 --> 00:42:34.236
Odds are good I'm
going to miss this one.

858
00:42:34.236 --> 00:42:36.516
You know, it might
get covered up.

859
00:42:36.516 --> 00:42:38.156
I'm not necessarily
looking at Terminal.

860
00:42:38.526 --> 00:42:39.346
But, you know, hey.

861
00:42:39.346 --> 00:42:40.196
Notifications.

862
00:42:40.196 --> 00:42:42.426
Let's see what we
can do with that.

863
00:42:43.726 --> 00:42:46.186
So I have a script
that I wrote here.

864
00:42:46.916 --> 00:42:49.646
If you don't know
Perl, don't be afraid.

865
00:42:49.646 --> 00:42:51.346
This is just what I'm
more comfortable with.

866
00:42:53.016 --> 00:42:55.866
So what this does is
it's going to just sit

867
00:42:55.866 --> 00:42:58.196
in the loop reading lines
of text as they come in.

868
00:42:58.266 --> 00:42:59.196
And, for every line of test,

869
00:42:59.196 --> 00:43:00.586
it's going to run the
rest of the script.

870
00:42:59.196 --> 00:43:00.586
it's going to run the
rest of the script.

871
00:43:00.586 --> 00:43:05.836
So this little hunk of line
noise breaks up the input line

872
00:43:05.836 --> 00:43:07.756
into three chunks,
breaking on colons.

873
00:43:07.756 --> 00:43:11.036
So we wind up with three
pieces: dollar one,

874
00:43:11.036 --> 00:43:12.006
dollar two, dollar three.

875
00:43:12.516 --> 00:43:16.236
And then we'll use those
to build up the parameters

876
00:43:16.236 --> 00:43:18.226
for a display notification
command.

877
00:43:18.226 --> 00:43:21.066
That's how you do
notification from AppleScript.

878
00:43:21.886 --> 00:43:23.376
And then we're going to run

879
00:43:23.556 --> 00:43:26.516
that assembled script
using osascript.

880
00:43:27.006 --> 00:43:29.336
Osascript is how you run
a script from Terminal.

881
00:43:31.596 --> 00:43:37.956
So, if we run that -- and if
I can spell it correctly --

882
00:43:44.416 --> 00:43:47.056
we can give it some
text, break up by colons,

883
00:43:48.686 --> 00:43:50.256
and watch the corner
of the screen there.

884
00:43:51.256 --> 00:43:54.846
We get our little notification.

885
00:43:55.296 --> 00:43:58.666
So now let's take the
previous command we had,

886
00:43:58.796 --> 00:44:03.906
the Syslog command, and pipe
it through notification filter.

887
00:43:58.796 --> 00:44:03.906
the Syslog command, and pipe
it through notification filter.

888
00:44:05.716 --> 00:44:07.186
So, now, this will
just sit here running.

889
00:44:07.186 --> 00:44:08.676
I can minimize this
window or whatever.

890
00:44:10.836 --> 00:44:12.396
But someone comes
along and does Pseudo;

891
00:44:13.216 --> 00:44:18.596
I get an actual notification
that shows up wherever I am.

892
00:44:19.516 --> 00:44:24.546
[ Applause ]

893
00:44:25.046 --> 00:44:27.446
And that is just a few ways
you can use notifications

894
00:44:27.746 --> 00:44:31.326
to improve the awareness
of your workflows

895
00:44:31.326 --> 00:44:32.246
that are running
on your machine.

896
00:44:32.736 --> 00:44:32.986
Sal?

897
00:44:34.346 --> 00:44:35.166
>> Sal Soghoian: Very cool.

898
00:44:36.306 --> 00:44:38.726
I like to know everything
that's going on in my house

899
00:44:39.096 --> 00:44:40.596
on every computer everywhere.

900
00:44:40.636 --> 00:44:44.006
I want total awareness
through notifications.

901
00:44:44.586 --> 00:44:49.546
So notification support in
Automator and AppleScript,

902
00:44:50.456 --> 00:44:54.516
it's been integrated right
into the editing applications,

903
00:44:54.616 --> 00:44:57.216
that you have resources
for Automator to do it,

904
00:44:57.576 --> 00:44:59.586
for AppleScript to
do it as well.

905
00:44:59.776 --> 00:45:00.886
This means you don't have

906
00:44:59.776 --> 00:45:00.886
This means you don't have

907
00:45:00.886 --> 00:45:04.016
to create these modal
confirmation dialogs,

908
00:45:04.316 --> 00:45:07.556
and now you can be 100
percent bounce free.

909
00:45:08.536 --> 00:45:10.536
So that's notification support.

910
00:45:12.066 --> 00:45:15.706
Next I'd like to talk about
accessibility integration.

911
00:45:17.676 --> 00:45:21.706
Now, some of you might be
familiar with Speakable Items.

912
00:45:21.706 --> 00:45:24.026
How many people in here
have used Speakable Items?

913
00:45:25.446 --> 00:45:26.286
Quite a few.

914
00:45:26.366 --> 00:45:27.076
Quite a few.

915
00:45:27.546 --> 00:45:32.726
And it's an architecture
built into OS X

916
00:45:33.556 --> 00:45:38.356
in the accessibility frameworks
and allows you to speak commands

917
00:45:38.356 --> 00:45:40.796
to your computer and have
them perform them for you.

918
00:45:41.476 --> 00:45:43.186
And it has a lot of integration.

919
00:45:43.186 --> 00:45:45.286
There is a lot of
customization built

920
00:45:45.286 --> 00:45:47.196
into the standard
set of commands.

921
00:45:47.196 --> 00:45:49.846
For example, you can
say, Mail this to mom,

922
00:45:49.846 --> 00:45:52.116
and it will understand
who mom is.

923
00:45:52.566 --> 00:45:54.776
You could say meet with
Karl Whelan [phonetic],

924
00:45:55.016 --> 00:45:58.616
and it will look up Karl
Whelan in your address book

925
00:45:58.616 --> 00:46:02.626
and then create a new
meeting for you in Calendar.

926
00:45:58.616 --> 00:46:02.626
and then create a new
meeting for you in Calendar.

927
00:46:03.146 --> 00:46:05.666
It has a lot of other commands
that are just basically,

928
00:46:05.666 --> 00:46:08.286
you know, work things
like open iPhoto,

929
00:46:08.286 --> 00:46:10.836
bring this window forward,
that kind of stuff.

930
00:46:10.896 --> 00:46:12.106
But it's very useful.

931
00:46:12.106 --> 00:46:16.546
So a lot of people use
this who are not involved

932
00:46:16.546 --> 00:46:17.726
in accessibility issues.

933
00:46:17.726 --> 00:46:20.266
It's just a nice
power feature to have.

934
00:46:21.056 --> 00:46:27.216
So what we've done in Mavericks
is we've created a new entity

935
00:46:27.216 --> 00:46:29.076
called Speakable Workflows.

936
00:46:29.076 --> 00:46:31.756
It's a way of saving
your workflows

937
00:46:32.196 --> 00:46:36.716
into the Speakable Items'
architecture and have it work

938
00:46:36.716 --> 00:46:37.976
for you automatically.

939
00:46:37.976 --> 00:46:41.646
So you can extend a set of
commands that are available

940
00:46:41.646 --> 00:46:43.636
by voice using Automator.

941
00:46:44.386 --> 00:46:46.376
And this is how it works.

942
00:46:46.376 --> 00:46:49.056
So, to turn on Speakable Items,

943
00:46:49.096 --> 00:46:52.616
you just go to the
Accessibility Preference pane.

944
00:46:52.916 --> 00:46:54.776
At the bottom of the list

945
00:46:54.776 --> 00:46:58.366
of different accessibility
features is Speakable Items.

946
00:46:58.596 --> 00:47:01.206
You select that and then
just click the radio button

947
00:46:58.596 --> 00:47:01.206
You select that and then
just click the radio button

948
00:47:01.206 --> 00:47:01.996
to turn it on.

949
00:47:02.746 --> 00:47:05.986
As confirmation, you'll see
this floating round window.

950
00:47:05.986 --> 00:47:08.116
That's the Speech
Feedback window.

951
00:47:08.426 --> 00:47:11.756
When that's available,
the computer is ready

952
00:47:11.756 --> 00:47:13.496
to respond to your commands.

953
00:47:13.946 --> 00:47:16.746
And, by default, you just
press down the Escape key

954
00:47:16.746 --> 00:47:19.226
and say your command and it
will start working for you.

955
00:47:20.156 --> 00:47:24.546
Now, in Automator, if you want
to create a Speakable Workflow,

956
00:47:24.546 --> 00:47:26.066
I have an example here.

957
00:47:26.686 --> 00:47:30.536
So I use USB keys all the time.

958
00:47:30.536 --> 00:47:31.226
I have one here.

959
00:47:31.226 --> 00:47:32.946
I call it Digital Briefcase.

960
00:47:33.546 --> 00:47:36.726
And, you know, I'm constantly
plugging them into the computer,

961
00:47:36.726 --> 00:47:38.356
and then I have to
go eject them.

962
00:47:38.616 --> 00:47:41.676
So I have to find some dialog,
whether it's an open dialog

963
00:47:41.676 --> 00:47:44.506
or finder window, find the
stupid little down thing,

964
00:47:44.506 --> 00:47:46.476
click that, and then
wait for the thing

965
00:47:46.476 --> 00:47:47.736
to eject and then grab it.

966
00:47:48.076 --> 00:47:51.136
I would really like to just
be able to tell the computer

967
00:47:51.136 --> 00:47:53.386
"Eject Digital Briefcase"
and, plop,

968
00:47:53.386 --> 00:47:55.016
it will just pull it out for me.

969
00:47:55.416 --> 00:47:58.776
So this is the workflow that
does that, and I'll walk you

970
00:47:58.776 --> 00:48:00.496
through it to show
you how to do this.

971
00:47:58.776 --> 00:48:00.496
through it to show
you how to do this.

972
00:48:01.256 --> 00:48:04.616
So it's an applet by default,

973
00:48:05.296 --> 00:48:10.176
and the first action is a
Find Finder Items action,

974
00:48:10.556 --> 00:48:12.496
and it looks for two parameters.

975
00:48:12.496 --> 00:48:17.286
One, it looks for volume whose
name is Digital Briefcase.

976
00:48:17.996 --> 00:48:21.006
Once it finds that
volume, it will pass

977
00:48:21.006 --> 00:48:24.936
that to the next action which
is just simply Eject Disc,

978
00:48:25.066 --> 00:48:27.056
and it will eject
for us automatically.

979
00:48:27.936 --> 00:48:32.856
Then the next step is to specify
some text I want as a response.

980
00:48:33.436 --> 00:48:35.676
And I type the word Done!

981
00:48:35.926 --> 00:48:40.556
and then have that
spoken by a certain voice.

982
00:48:40.736 --> 00:48:42.076
I've chosen Samantha.

983
00:48:42.746 --> 00:48:46.396
So then I choose to
save this workflow.

984
00:48:46.396 --> 00:48:48.146
This will be my Speakable
Workflow.

985
00:48:48.396 --> 00:48:52.996
And in the Save sheet you'll see
that there is a File Format menu

986
00:48:53.496 --> 00:48:54.776
that says Application.

987
00:48:55.286 --> 00:49:00.326
Well, if I click on that,
there's a new file format.

988
00:48:55.286 --> 00:49:00.326
Well, if I click on that,
there's a new file format.

989
00:49:00.516 --> 00:49:03.696
If you have Speakable Items
architecture turned on

990
00:49:03.696 --> 00:49:08.326
and installed on your machine,
you will see this in Automator

991
00:49:08.326 --> 00:49:10.096
and it's called a
Speakable Item.

992
00:49:10.696 --> 00:49:14.056
So, therefore, I can save
this as a Speakable Item.

993
00:49:14.626 --> 00:49:16.886
You'll notice that
Speakable Item appears

994
00:49:16.936 --> 00:49:18.636
on the File Format menu,

995
00:49:18.906 --> 00:49:22.636
but it also automatically
locates the Speakable Items

996
00:49:22.636 --> 00:49:25.576
folder which is within
your Speech folder which is

997
00:49:25.616 --> 00:49:26.876
within your Home folder.

998
00:49:27.546 --> 00:49:29.906
In other words, that's
the location

999
00:49:30.196 --> 00:49:32.276
that the speech architecture
uses.

1000
00:49:32.636 --> 00:49:36.606
So, when you save,
you want to save it

1001
00:49:36.606 --> 00:49:40.116
with a name being the
name of the command.

1002
00:49:40.116 --> 00:49:43.696
So, in this case, I'm going to
say Eject Digital Briefcase,

1003
00:49:43.896 --> 00:49:46.196
and that's what I want to be
able to say to my computer.

1004
00:49:46.596 --> 00:49:47.536
I save that.

1005
00:49:47.536 --> 00:49:52.106
It will install it into the
Speakable Items architecture

1006
00:49:52.106 --> 00:49:53.316
for me automatically.

1007
00:49:53.886 --> 00:49:58.246
So the next time my thumb drive
is plugged into the computer

1008
00:49:58.246 --> 00:50:02.956
like it is here, if I want to,
no matter what program I'm in,

1009
00:49:58.246 --> 00:50:02.956
like it is here, if I want to,
no matter what program I'm in,

1010
00:50:03.286 --> 00:50:06.516
if I want to eject
it, I just simply --

1011
00:50:07.156 --> 00:50:10.296
I just simply say the command -

1012
00:50:11.426 --> 00:50:13.626
>> "Eject Digital
Briefcase" [laughter].

1013
00:50:13.986 --> 00:50:18.206
>> It does it.

1014
00:50:18.316 --> 00:50:18.676
>> "Done!"

1015
00:50:19.246 --> 00:50:20.296
>> -- and then says done.

1016
00:50:21.466 --> 00:50:26.886
So there's a very simple example
of how you can take workflows

1017
00:50:26.886 --> 00:50:31.996
and integrate them in with the
speech recognition architecture

1018
00:50:31.996 --> 00:50:35.286
in the operating system
to perform custom actions.

1019
00:50:35.966 --> 00:50:40.736
Now, in preparation for release
of Mavericks in the fall,

1020
00:50:41.056 --> 00:50:45.796
we'll be posting a new website
called Speakable Workflows.com

1021
00:50:46.146 --> 00:50:49.576
that will have hundreds of
examples that you can download.

1022
00:50:50.046 --> 00:50:52.656
In addition, they'll be a
feedback mechanism there

1023
00:50:52.656 --> 00:50:56.416
that you can send us response
about how you use this,

1024
00:50:56.516 --> 00:50:59.216
the kind of things that you're
looking for, that kind of thing.

1025
00:50:59.216 --> 00:51:02.636
So we encourage you to give
this a try in Mavericks.

1026
00:50:59.216 --> 00:51:02.636
So we encourage you to give
this a try in Mavericks.

1027
00:51:03.666 --> 00:51:08.186
So, in summary, this has been
a great release for automation.

1028
00:51:08.556 --> 00:51:10.546
We've had a lot of
new stuff happening.

1029
00:51:10.546 --> 00:51:13.346
Specifically, we
added iCloud support

1030
00:51:13.416 --> 00:51:16.336
so that you can have your
scripts just distributed

1031
00:51:16.336 --> 00:51:19.086
across all the computers
that you use.

1032
00:51:19.486 --> 00:51:23.556
We added code signing so that
you can distribute your applets

1033
00:51:23.556 --> 00:51:27.226
and droplets to every -- to your
customers or to your friends

1034
00:51:27.526 --> 00:51:30.716
without invoking any of
the Gatekeeper responses.

1035
00:51:31.206 --> 00:51:35.066
We now have a new construct
for extending the power

1036
00:51:35.066 --> 00:51:38.146
of AppleScript through
AppleScript libraries

1037
00:51:38.626 --> 00:51:43.306
which you can write yourself in
AppleScript and expose commands

1038
00:51:43.306 --> 00:51:46.456
and terminology that you
didn't have available before.

1039
00:51:47.396 --> 00:51:50.506
And we now have introduced
the new use clause

1040
00:51:50.506 --> 00:51:54.256
that will really streamline
the syntax of your scripts

1041
00:51:54.256 --> 00:51:57.016
and add a lot of power
and ability to them.

1042
00:51:58.166 --> 00:52:01.666
And we've implemented
notification support in addition

1043
00:51:58.166 --> 00:52:01.666
And we've implemented
notification support in addition

1044
00:52:01.666 --> 00:52:03.796
to our new Speakable Workflows.

1045
00:52:04.346 --> 00:52:07.586
So that's quite a bit that's
been going on this year.

1046
00:52:07.586 --> 00:52:09.476
This is a great release for us.

1047
00:52:09.476 --> 00:52:10.996
We're really excited about it.

1048
00:52:11.596 --> 00:52:14.706
Now, if you have questions or
more information I'll point

1049
00:52:14.706 --> 00:52:18.346
to these four guys that you can
probably beat up with Nerf bats

1050
00:52:18.346 --> 00:52:21.786
or something to get
answers out of them.

1051
00:52:21.826 --> 00:52:25.076
And, in additional,
remember the session

1052
00:52:25.076 --> 00:52:26.306
on AppleScript libraries.

1053
00:52:26.476 --> 00:52:28.956
And there's one more
thing: Did you know this?

1054
00:52:29.516 --> 00:52:33.816
Some of you might not know
this but this is a special day

1055
00:52:33.816 --> 00:52:39.506
for us because, 20
years ago at WWDC,

1056
00:52:39.506 --> 00:52:41.956
AppleScript was released
to the world.

1057
00:52:42.516 --> 00:52:52.586
[ Applause ]

1058
00:52:53.086 --> 00:52:57.406
And it's been a very, very
powerful boon to our customers,

1059
00:52:57.406 --> 00:53:01.376
to us, to engineers,
to everybody to use it

1060
00:52:57.406 --> 00:53:01.376
to us, to engineers,
to everybody to use it

1061
00:53:01.376 --> 00:53:05.196
to create automations that
really empower and change lives.

1062
00:53:05.196 --> 00:53:07.696
It has been a fantastic
language.

1063
00:53:07.976 --> 00:53:10.616
It's constantly growing,
expanding.

1064
00:53:10.616 --> 00:53:12.456
And, as you can see,
with this release,

1065
00:53:12.696 --> 00:53:14.826
there's new things
happening all the time.

1066
00:53:15.496 --> 00:53:17.966
So we just want to take
this one opportunity

1067
00:53:17.966 --> 00:53:22.556
on the 20th anniversary of this
technology to say thank you

1068
00:53:22.806 --> 00:53:26.016
to all the developers who
made their apps scriptable.

1069
00:53:26.386 --> 00:53:29.456
We want to say thank you to
all the scripters that wrote

1070
00:53:29.456 --> 00:53:31.606
and shared scripts
with the community.

1071
00:53:31.816 --> 00:53:34.706
We want to say thank
you to all the customers

1072
00:53:34.706 --> 00:53:38.036
that use AppleScript and
rely on it every day.

1073
00:53:38.336 --> 00:53:42.086
And to the engineers that
make their apps scriptable

1074
00:53:42.086 --> 00:53:44.926
and to the engineers at Apple
that implemented AppleScript,

1075
00:53:45.056 --> 00:53:47.146
we want to say thank
you as well.

1076
00:53:47.496 --> 00:53:48.896
So have a great conference.

1077
00:53:48.896 --> 00:53:50.986
We'll see you later
this afternoon, guys.

1078
00:53:51.136 --> 00:53:51.646
[applause] Thank you.
